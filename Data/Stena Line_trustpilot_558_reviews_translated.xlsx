"Högsta betyg. Åkte Göteborg-Kiel. Tog en dyrare hytt med panoramafönster. Vänlig och proffsig personal på hela båten, i resturang och bar och även på våning 11 där vi bodde.
Buffén var toppklass, oerhört prisvärt och god mat. Jättefint utbud av kalla och varma rätter, desser och ostbricka.
Hytten var bra städad och badrummet var toppen. Tom duschen var bra. Frukosten morgonen därpå var som vilken hotellfrukost som helst, jättebra.
Enda minuset var när vi skulle köra av i Kiel, det tog ungefär en timme innan vi kunde köra iväg från Kiel, men det är nog mer att skylla på trafiken i Kiel och inte så mycket på Stena Line.
Kommer definitivt åka Kielfärjan igen!",Datoen for opplevelsen: 14. juni 2024,Högsta betyg och en trevlig start på semestern,Vurdert til 5 av 5 stjerner,"Highest rating. Went Gothenburg-Kiel. Took a more expensive cabin with panoramic windows. Friendly and professional staff throughout the boat, in the restaurant and bar and also on floor 11 where we stayed. The buffet was top class, incredibly affordable and good food. Excellent range of cold and hot dishes, desserts and cheese tray. The cabin was well cleaned and the bathroom was great. The empty shower was good. The breakfast the next morning was like any hotel breakfast, great. The only minus was when we had to drive off in Kiel, it took about an hour before we could drive away from Kiel, but that is probably more to blame on the traffic in Kiel and not so much on Stena Line. Will definitely ride the Kiel ferry again!",SV
"8 maand op voorhand boek ik een retour Cherbourg Rosslare, heen binnenhut, 6 weken later terug BUITENHUT (hut met raampje). Krijg na betaling mail met tittel: 'Bevestiging' die dit bevestigd. Nu...44d voor de terugvaart krijg ik mail met bijlage en tittel: 'Bevestiging' (maar met ditmaal de hutnummers) de hutten zijn op dek 6 en voor heenreis (8 maand op voorhand geboekt) krijgen we 605,blijkt dat we voor de terugreis een BINNENHUT krijgen, hut 603!!!! Hun uitleg achteraf is dat er een sanitair probleem was in de buitenhut. Toch vreemd dat je dan 291d na je boeking een kamer voor de terugreis krijgt exact naast de kamer van heenreis.

"Got on the train for a 3 hour journey on 22nd May to get to Stenaline ferry in Holyhead to go to Dublin. Half way there my wife phoned to say she had checked Stenaline and found that my ferry had been cancelled. I had received no notification from Stenaline about the cancellation, After having to put a claim into them, I eventually received a refund for the cancellation plus my return and train journey. I then rebooked 2 weeks later on 5th June and just about to depart for my journey when I checked Stenaline updates and saw that the ferrys earlier had been delayed. My wife telephoned Stenaline and was assured my ferry would be fine and on time. After 3 hour train journey I reached Stenaline ferry port only to be told that my ferry would be delayed by 35 minutes due to Frieght lorries arriving late and having to wait for them. I eventually got on the ferry and it arrived at 6.35pm instead of 6pm, yet they would not let the foot passengers off and let the frieght lorries and the cars off first before sending the bus to get the foot passengers. By the time I got off it was just past 7pm....an hour later than it should of been and I had to pay extra for my connection from Dublin due to the extra hour delay. I emailed to complain and was advised no compensation as the ferry was not an hour late, apprentley they dont count the fact they wont let foot passengers off the ferry before lorries and cars. I will never travel on Stenaline again. They seem to treat foot passengers as non entities and actually prefer lorries and cars giving them priority over boarding and getting off the ferry. Also, waste of money paying for the Stena lounge at £25 as the meals are small but expensive, plus the free food you get with your payment are just really small bite size peices of cake etc. Also all the good seats are taken up by the car and lorry drivers who are allowed on before the foot passengers.

"Wir reisen seit 30 Jahren mehrmals jährlich mit der Fähre nach Irland. Zahlreiche Fährfahrten mit unterschiedlichen Gesellschaften sind dabei zusammengekommen.

Bei Stena hat uns am 17. April 2024 bei der Fahrt von Rosslare nach Cherbourg dieses Mal überrascht, dass uns eine Leistung angeboten und verkauft wurde, die dann nicht erbracht wurde. Bei unserer Buchung hieß es: „Abendbuffet inkl. Bier, Tischwein u. Softdrinks“. Auf unseren Hinweis an die Mitarbeiter bei der Essensausgabe auf die eingepreisten Getränke folgte ein sehr freundliches Gespräch mit dem zuständigen Manager. Er kannte das Problem, dass auf der deutschen Internet-Seite auf Getränke verwiesen wurde, die im Preis eingeschlossen seien, doch dieses Leistungsversprechen konnte an Bord nicht erfüllt werden. Es konnten zum Abendessen auch keine alkoholischen Getränke gegen Extrazahlung erworben werden, da keine Schankgenehmigung in irischen Gewässern vorhanden sei. Da frage ich mich schon, ob man sich bei Ihrem Unternehmen bewusst ist, dass der Verkauf von Leistungen, die nicht erbracht werden können oder sollen, durchaus rechtliche Folgen haben kann.

Wenig kundenfreundlich ist es, wenn Pkw und Lkw auf dem Deck so kombiniert werden, dass man – angeleitet durch Ihr Personal – das Treppenhaus nur erreichen kann, wenn man sich an einem Lkw-Auflieger vorbeidrückt.

Wir haben uns mit zwei Mails an Stena gewandt. Leider vergeblich.

We have taken numerous ferry trips with different companies. On April 17, 2024, on the trip from Rosslare to Cherbourg with Stena, we were surprised that we were offered and sold a service that was then not provided. When we booked, it said: &quot;Evening buffet including beer, table wine and soft drinks&quot;. When we pointed out to the staff serving the food that the drinks were included in the price, a very friendly conversation with the manager in charge followed. He was aware of the problem that the German website referred to drinks that were included in the price, but this service promise could not be fulfilled on board. Alcoholic drinks could not be purchased for dinner for an extra charge because there is no liquor license in Irish waters. I wonder whether your company is aware that selling services that cannot or should not be provided can have legal consequences. It is not very customer-friendly when cars and trucks are combined on the deck in such a way that - under the guidance of your staff - you can only reach the staircase by pushing past a truck trailer. We sent Stena two emails. Unfortunately, to no avail. There is another way to be customer-friendly!",DE

"Stena Line's Customer service team are awesome.

On our outbound journey we got caught in a traffic jam.

The traffic jam cleared & we got to the terminal 10 minutes after the 14:15 deadline. The check-in lady changed our booking back to 14:45 sailing and we got onboard without any issues.

We then wanted to change our Dublin-Holyhead booking to Belfast-Cairnryan. Another call to customer services and this was resolved in a few minutes with a minor cost increase that included upgrade toStena Lounge access.

"Travelled with Stena twice across the Irish Sea and both times have been a calamity.

"I want to specifically write about the pet lounge and the way stena line is charging customers 20 quid without giving any additional service than what they were already giving.

We took our dog from Cairn Ryan to Belfast. Paid for the pet lounge. The policy states that they need to be inside the carrier at all times. This is absolutely not needed as its a closed space with us needing access to get in and only dog owners can enter the lounge. If I had to keep my dog in a cage for over 2 hours I would rather have kept him in the car.

I would understand if dogs are not allowed on the furniture but keeping them locked up all the times seems unfair even after paying additional fee for the pet lounge.

My dog started feeling uneasy and didn't want to stay in the carrier and we removed him and they came and told us to put him back in. Even after requesting one of the employees and the employee agreeing to us keeping our dog outside the carrier another attendant came and told us to put him inside the carrier again.

Again there is absolutely no reason for this as its an enclosed space and can accommodate more than 10 dogs outside the carrier.

"Cairnryan to Belfast. Nothing wrong with the boat and all the staff seemed nice enough. The price is pretty high, but you take it or leave it I guess.

My main complaint was that the Stena Plus lounge was like a mad house - I didn’t even bother staying in it. From the moment we went in there were kids yelling and running around, running up an launching themselves at the rotating armchairs to see how fast they could make them spin.

Nothing wrong with the boat and all the staff seemed nice enough. The price is pretty high, but you take it or leave it I guess.

My main complaint was that the Stena Plus lounge was like a mad house - I didn’t even bother staying in it. From the moment we went in there were kids yelling and running around, running up an launching themselves at the rotating armchairs to see how fast they could make them spin.

"For the second year in a row at Christmas, my trip home has been delayed significantly. I appreciate there can be adverse weather but just today they contacted to say that they have swapped ships for the day of my delayed boat. They didn't ensure that I could get a pet cabin even in the next crossing which means the next available crossing to Cherbourg with pet cabin isn't until 8 days (3 Jan) after my intended travel date (27 Dec). Just can't take the uncertainty and if you delay someone's travel twice you should be able to guarantee that you will be able to travel with your pet.

"I don't normally leave a review but I feel I need to commend the fantastic service and skill of the staff on the Stena Nordica Ferry.
It was a very rough day to sail but we made it from Holyhead to Dublin comfortably and that's all down to the members of staff that went above and beyond to support us. We have a 2 month old baby girl and a 3 year old son. My son became very sea sick at the seating area with my partner and I was struggling to walk back from the toilet with my newborn at the same time.
A lady working at the food city restaurant and another young female member of staff came to our aid immediately. They supported us to remove all of our belongings: buggy, jackets, bags etc. to a safer part of the ship while also cleaning/helping our little boy to feel better. They did all of this with a high standard of professionalism and a good sense of humour.
The OSS manager approached us only a few moments later and offered us a free cabin as they had one available. She also escorted us to the reception area where another nice gentleman helped us to the room.
The teamwork, excellent communication, professionalism and kindness of all the staff mentioned above was absolutely outstanding. Hospitality at its finest!

Was due to sail on Estrid Dublin to Holyhead on 24.6.23 on 0215am sailing.

Arrived at Port to be told there was a 3 hour delay, also no pet cabins available, albeit I had booked one for my initial sailing. A very stressful and unacceptable situation for lone female travelling with nervous dog. Return journey on Nordica. Pet cabin not as described as no pet mats, drinking bowl or tea, coffee makings. Completed complaints form but heard nothing so rang customer services. They stated they had no knowledge of my complaint even though I had received an automated e mail acknowledging receipt of complaint together with a reference number. I was advised to e mail head of customer service, Nicola Marsh which I have done but still awaiting response.

"On Thursday 16th November I traveled from Dublin to Holyhead on the Stena Adventurer. It was lovely. When we got to Holyhead, we were told to go down to our cars and be ready for disembarkment. When I got to my van, I saw one of the tires was fully flat (rim sitting on the ground).
Two Stena Line mechanics in Holyhead came to help - Paul Clarke and Owen Hughes. They were so helpful and helped get the spare wheel on. After that they told me to drive to their garage and they’d plug the flat wheel and also re-balance it. Also ensured all 4 tires were topped up with air. After this they put the spare tire back in its place under the van etc, and I was good to go.

"Eines vorab: Kabine war in einwandfreien Zustand, dass Frühstück erwartungsgemäß Kantinenniveau. Aber der Check-In-Bereich in Trelleborg für Passagiere. Am 02.09.2023 hatte ich das zweifelhafte ""Vergnügen"", den Check-In-Bereich in Trelleborg kennenzulernen. Und muss sagen- ich war echt geschockt. Dass ist einer international tätigen Fährgesellschaft absolut unwürdig. Sie muten den Passagieren zu, einen Wartebereich ohne Toiletten ggf über lange Zeit nutzen zu müssen. In meinem Fall ab 18 Uhr da ich auf der Reise von Bornholm zurück war. Ganz davon zu schweigen dass es keine Möglichkeit gab, etwas zu trinken oder zu essen (Snacks) zu kaufen. Biker irrten umher, weil nicht klar war, wo es gilt einzuchecken. Der Warteraum war irgendwann mit Fahrrädern vollgestellt, die Menschen saßen auf dem Boden. Das gerade eine skandinavische Fährlinie so unprofessionell mit alternativen Reisemöglichkeiten umgeht, hat mich erschüttert. Oder sind ihnen diese Reisenden weniger wert weil diese nicht soviel Umsatz generieren? Dass wir dann noch als letztes gegen 22:30 Uhr auf der Fähre waren und somit auch keine Möglichkeit mehr bestand, in Ruhe etwas essen zu können, setzt dem ganzen noch die Krone auf. Ach ne, Rostock war ja noch besser- wer hat sich eigentlich einfallen lassen, den Shuttlebus nicht auf die Fähre zu schicken? Diese Treppe runter zum Bus ist mit viel Gepäck eine Zumutung, für ältere Menschen eine Qual. In Summe war diese Erfahrung für alle Beteiligten keine Werbung für Stena und alternatives Reisen.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 02. september 2023,Für Fußgänger eine Zumutung,Vurdert til 2 av 5 stjerner,"One thing in advance: the cabin was in perfect condition, the breakfast was, as expected, canteen level. But the check-in area in Trelleborg for passengers. On September 2nd, 2023, I had the dubious &quot;pleasure&quot; of getting to know the check-in area in Trelleborg. And I have to say - I was really shocked. That is absolutely unworthy of an international ferry company. They expect passengers to have to use a waiting area without toilets, possibly for a long time. In my case from 6 p.m. because I was on the way back from Bornholm. Not to mention that there was no way to buy something to drink or eat (snacks). Bikers wandered around because it was not clear where to check in. At some point the waiting room was full of bicycles, people were sitting on the floor. The fact that a Scandinavian ferry line in particular deals with alternative travel options so unprofessionally shocked me. Or are these travelers less valuable to them because they don&#39;t generate as much revenue? The fact that we were the last ones on the ferry at around 10:30 p.m. and therefore had no chance to eat something in peace is the icing on the cake. Oh no, Rostock was even better - who actually thought of not sending the shuttle bus onto the ferry? The stairs down to the bus are a nightmare with a lot of luggage, and torture for older people. All in all, this experience was not an advertisement for Stena and alternative travel for anyone involved.",DE

"Utroligt skuffende oplevelse! Vi skulle have været med færgen Frederikshavn - Gøteborg d. 25 juli kl. 8:15, som gående passagerer. Vi kørte hjemmefra i god tid, og ankom til parkeringspladsen ved færgen kl. 7:15. Allerede her var der kaos og over 10 biler der kørte rundt, for at finde en p-plads. Bilerne holdt allerede parkeret på græsset langs hegnet, ud til vejen. Vi opgav at finde plads her, og var efterfølgende på 6 andre parkeringspladser i området. Alle med begrænset parkering, eller en app der ikke virkede, så vi ikke kunne parkere alligevel.
Kl. 8:10 var valget at smide bilen, og få en p-bøde på 800 kr, eller at droppe det og miste 500 kr, som billetten havde kostet os. Vi valgte sidste mulighed.

Da jeg kontaktede Stena Line for at forklare situationen, var der ikke meget hjælp at hente. Den eneste refunderings mulighed, var at vi kunne ombooke vores billet til et andet tidspunkt, for 200 kr ekstra, og risikere at stå i samme situation med manglende parkeringspladser. Nej tak.
Virkelig dårligt af Stena Line, at det ikke er muligt for jeres gående passagerer at komme af med bilen, og på færgen!
Så må i simpelthen udvide og lave flere p-pladser, eller stoppe med at overbooke jeres færger.

When I contacted Stena Line to explain the situation, there was not much help to be had. The only refund option was that we could rebook our ticket for another time, for DKK 200 extra, and risk being in the same situation with a lack of parking spaces. No thanks. Really bad of Stena Line that it is not possible for your walking passengers to get off the car and onto the ferry!

"I’m a frequent ferry user, Holyhead to Dublin. My experience on Stena has been substandard this occasion. I was due to leave 9am and 16h before departure a gale force 10 kicked off, trees near my house were uprooted. Everything forecast well ahead.

Rather than have some foresight and advise times were ‘at risk’ they kept the ‘on time’ notification on the website until the early hours. I checked it at 1:30am. They waited till after 3am to text informing me they were leaving an hour early and check in was closing 7:45am for a 9am sailing.

I have a habit of being asleep at 3am, so woke up realising that arriving 70 minutes early as planned would see me missing the ferry. I lost time waiting for customer services to open and getting in a flap about what to do.

I wasn’t able to make it as I’d never even heard of it going early before. Given that I live 20 minutes from the port and trees in my area were getting uprooted 16h before departure they can’t say they had no warning. I’ve just never expected it to go early without me. The consequences of missing the ferry were harsh, I missed quality time with my partners family who will mostly be on their way home by the time I arrive. I was supposed to be in Dungarvan for 4pm but now arrive after 9pm.

Some earlier communication would have helped given the storm was in place 16h before. I would have just gotten to the port with 2h to spare. They said it was captain’s decision but they could have predicted the time was “at risk” and offered some info before 3am.

Customer services responded quickly they were apologetic but overall they came across as defensive and dismissive sticking to their guns. My complaint was about how it was communicated badly at 3am.

"Genuinely a great journey with Stena from Birkenhead - Belfast, As soon as I was onboard the Ferry -Stena Embla- you stop you're car, turn of you're car alarm and then grab whatever you need from you're car -Just to mention, you can't go down to you're car so make sure to grab everything you need!- and head up the stairs to whatever deck you want to go on, as soon as we found our seat, I unpacked my stuff and sat down, the seats were comfy and you could sleep on it if you wanted too -Loads of people do it-. Before we departed, I went out on deck and I looked around for a bit, and noticed a dog kennel thingy for dogs that if you had a dog you would need to put them in there. You needed a code to enter the room for the dogs. Breakfast ends at around 11ish but we didn't know it did and when we asked for toast they said breakfast had ended but..... They had extra toast and gave it to us for free which in my opinion was very nice of them! Also, people say the Wifi onboard is bad but I managed to play a Roblox game without too much lag or it crashing -It was only £2 for 10 hours and unless you like a VPN then don't get the £4 one as it isn
t that different to the £2 and all the difference is is a VPN- so that certainly must be some good Wifi. During the journey, I explored the ship and found 2 cinemas, a duty free -That closed towards the end of the journey-, an arcade, loads of cabins, lounge, a bar, cafe, multiple bathrooms and loads of other stuff! However, as we sailed farther away from the River Mersey, the waves got worse and worse and the winds were getting worse to the point were they had to close the all the doors that led to the outside and we even had to sail towards Scotland, but this lead to some amazing views of Scotland and The Isle Of Man. Before those views, I ate some vegan nuggets with some chips, the good thing is is that you can get as many salt packets for free and ketchup and mayo but I didn't need any other than salt as everything was well seasoned and wasn't like those veggie nuggets from the 70's that were full of peas it was like if the Mcplant was in a chicken nugget if you get me. Anyways it was quite good but if you are a foot passenger then I think you need to pay for like a bus ticket im pretty sure.

"Stupidly, my other half left his backpack on the ferry at Cairnryan and we didn’t realise until we got home (a 6 hour drive later).

We immediately filled out the contact form on their website. No response.

We filled out another contact form and this time did get a response. We explained that the backpack had been left onboard and that it contained two iPads, a pair of binoculars and some cash.

We were informed that any lost and found property was taken off the boat on crew change over day, Wednesdays, and that they would be back in contact with us. We sailed on a Friday and it was now Saturday.

Thankfully the other half can track his iPads and informed the customer service person (we don’t know their name they never gave it) of this and that he had seen they were making their way back and forth across the North Sea. Great, they said, we will contact the crew.

No further contact so on the Wednesday the other half emailed them again asking if there had been any joy. Silence.

It took raising a complaint to hear anything further and this is where it gets interesting.

No sign of the backpack I’m afraid, they tell us.
That’s odd because we can see at least one of the iPads is still making it’s way back and forth. Perhaps they are no longer in the backpack?

Apparently they checked again, still no backpack or iPads.

Now, call me cynical, but if a passenger had taken the backpack/iPads then they would be located elsewhere in the country/world. Isn’t it strange that there is apparently no sign of them yet appear to still be on the boat?

We have informed them we will be contacting the police to report them as stolen so we can make a claim on our insurance but perhaps we might drop the nugget to the police that they are still on that darned boat.

Jeg har ikke været hjemme i lang tid og har ikke set eller talt med min familie. Jeg kommer til boardingkontrollen, og de ser mine danske id-dokumenter, som er sundhedskort og id-kort, jeg har fået udstedt fra Aalborg Kommune, der har billede og alle mine vigtige oplysninger. Og jeg havde mit gamle svenske pas, der desværre var udløbet, da jeg ikke kunne komme hjem og forny det pga det ikke fandet ledige pas tideri flere måneder de det var præcis efter COVID-19 pandemien og alle ville ud og rejse.
Når jeg talte med dem som stod i boarding kontrollen forklarede jeg hele min situation, viste mine id-dokumenter og ville vise bevis for, at jeg havde en tid til at forny mit pas hos den svenske politi i Borås den 20/10. Men nej, de nægtede mig. De ville ikke se det. Selvom de kan se, at jeg er mig, og at jeg har legitime grunde til at komme hjem. Jeg græder og ryster og beder dem om hjælp. Men nej. Og ingen kommer og spørger, om jeg har det godt bagefter, når jeg sidder og ryster og græder og græder. Hvordan kan det være tilladt at være sådan her? Jeg har boet i Sverige hele mit liv, jeg er svensk, jeg viser id-dokumenter, der beviser, at jeg er mig, hvor firkantet kan det tillades at være? Årsagen til, at jeg ikke kan vise et kørekort i stedet for et pas, er jo, at jeg ikke har taget kørekort. Og det id-dokument, jeg har fået udstedt af Aalborg Kommune, er det eneste alternativ, jeg kan få, ud over kørekort. Så hvad sker der? Jeg er fanget i Danmark.

I get to the boarding control, and they see my Danish ID documents, which are health cards and ID cards I have been issued by Aalborg Municipality, which have a picture and all my important information. And I had my old Swedish passport, which unfortunately had expired, as I couldn&#39;t come home and renew it because I couldn&#39;t find any available passports for several months, it was exactly after the COVID-19 pandemic and everyone wanted to travel. When I spoke to those in boarding control I explained my whole situation, showed my ID documents and wanted to show proof that I had an appointment to renew my passport at the Swedish police in Borås on 20/10. But no, they refused me. They didn&#39;t want to see it. Although they can see that I am me and that I have legitimate reasons to come home. I cry and shake and ask them for help. But no.

I have lived in Sweden all my life, I am Swedish, I show ID documents that prove that I am me, how square can it be allowed to be?

"It started badly before our trip when I was unable to submit the application form because I was born before 1958! So my partner, Vicki, who is younger had to drive my car on to the ferry. I am only 67, hardly elderly these days. When we arrived at the ferry terminal in Fishguard, the operator was very efficient in texting me that, due to adverse weather, there would be a one-hour delay. This is unavoidable, and so I am still giving 1 genuine star for unavoidable delay with good handling and communication. However, a lengthy wait was not helped by the complete lack of refreshments at the ticket office, despite 'delicious coffee' being advertised. Drinks were dispensed from a basic catering machine which had broken down. There was no alternative, other than to walk off the waiting area to the local shopping parade where, luckily, the fish and chip shop provided great refreshments which should have been available as a given at the port. Once on-board and sailing - and once the ship's restaurant had (finally) opened - I was told by a surly counter assistant that I was standing in the wrong place in the queue (there was no-one behind us). When my partner asked if chips were included with the burgers she was told abruptly that they were, 'as you can see from the customer's plate in front of you'. I do not stare at other people's food. The coffee (highly-priced for a paper cup of instant at 3.7 Euros) tasted like dishwater, and our burgers were revolting. In fact, the whole thing would've tasted better at McDonalds - and that is saying something! The staff were equally surly when telling my partner Vicki that there was no reading material (magazines) available in the shop. Furthermore, when trying to embark at Rosslare, we asked another member of staff where the lift was as she has arthritic knees and has difficulty walking down stairs (but not up). Again, the answer was surly, with the attempted indifference of a mere 'point' and knowing 'right there!' comment (and un-engaged look). We entered the lift, alongside a young couple with a baby in a pram. When the mother pressed the button the announcement stated that there was no travel to the ground floor, so we all got out and Vicki struggled down the stairs backwards, holding up other passengers.

"We hebben de Stena line n.a.v. onze laatste reis een mail gestuurd. We hoeven echt geen compensatie maar wilden onze ervaring delen met de Stena Line. Het antwoord is allerminst bevredigend te noemen.
Je zou als bedrijf kunnen beginnen met ""Wat vervelend"" o.i.d. maar helaas geen enkele opmerking van dien aard.

Hieronder de Text van onze mail en daaronder weer het antwoord:

Beste,
We zijn afgelopen Kerstvakantie naar mijn zoon en zijn gezin in Zweden geweest en daarbij gebruik gemaakt van de Stena line.
We doen dit al jaren en er zijn wel eens wat kleine issues geweest maar altijd keurig opgelost.
Afgelopen heen en terug reis waren wel zeer treurig.
Nog afgezien van de steeds duurder wordende boekingen zijn we toch wel erg geschrokken van de staat van de hutten.
We boeken tegenwoordig een binnen hut omdat je toch weinig tot niets ziet door de ramen omdat het donker is.
We waanden ons in de ambiance van een oude oceaan liner, het was allemaal zo armoedig, en gedateerd is niet eens het juiste woordkeuze in deze.
Het was oud, kapot en beschadigd en het leek wel of de Stena er geen euro meer aan wil uitgeven.
We zijn echt niet in de veronderstelling dat we boeken op een luxe cruise o.i.d. maar dit was heel erg.
een klein voorbeeldje, het gootsteentje in de hut liep vrijwel niet door en derhalve durfden we niet eens te douchen.
Wij voelden ons echt niet fijn op de boot, als het onderhoud van de hutten ook is doorgevoerd op het onderhoud van de veiligheid op de boot dan maken we ons zeer veel zorgen.
We hebben al geboekt voor de Mei vakantie 2024 maar hebben er eigenlijk niet zo'n goed gevoel bij.
Het gevoel is de motivatie dat ik dit nu wil melden bij de Stena.
Ik hoop dat u bij ons dit gevoel kan wegnemen anders denk ik dat we liever via de bruggen naar Zweden gaan reizen i.p.v. met de boot.

Met vriendelijke groet,
Marianne en Ido Bormann

Vervolgens het antwoord:

Goedemorgen,
Dank u voor uw bericht.
Wij zullen uw feedback over de hut doorsturen naar onze schepen op deze route. Ons advies is altijd, wanneer u een klacht heeft m.b.t. een geboekte hut, dit direct te melden bij de Guest service desk aan boord zodat zij u hier gelijk mee hadden kunnen helpen door de hut na te kijken en u eventueel een andere hut hadden kunnen aanbieden. Wanneer zij u geen alternatief kunnen aanbieden zullen zij een restitutie verzoek bij ons indienen. Achteraf kunnen wij hierin helaas niks voor u betekenen.

Onze schepen gaan elke jaar naar dok voor onderhoud en keuringen en voldoen aan alle veiligheidsvoorschriften.

Bedankt voor het antwoord, al is het zeer onbevredigend.
Het word zeer makkelijk afgedaan als je hebt aan boord niet geklaagd dus zoek het maar uit.
U heeft dus duidelijk geen idee waar we in terecht zijn gekomen.
Wij weten nu wel dat we een alternatief moeten zoeken hoe wij bij onze zoon in Zweden kunnen geraken.
De Stena is dan voor ons geen optie meer.

Bedankt en een fijne dag,
Groet Ido

HIERNA TAAL NOCH TEKEN MEER VAN DE STENA LINE

Ik denk dat de Stena weer een klantje kwijt is op deze manier en dat voor ruim 800 euro voor de overtocht.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 23. desember 2023,Stena line is gezakt naar een bedenkelijk niveau,Vurdert til 1 av 5 stjerner,"We sent an email to the Stena line after our last trip. We really don&#39;t need any compensation but wanted to share our experience with the Stena Line. The answer is far from satisfactory. As a company you could start with &quot;How annoying&quot; or something like that, but unfortunately no such comment. Below is the text of our email and below it the answer: Dear, Last Christmas we went to visit my son and his family in Sweden and used the Stena line. We have been doing this for years and there have been some minor issues, but they have always been resolved neatly. The last journey there and back was very sad. Apart from the increasingly expensive bookings, we are very shocked by the condition of the cabins. Nowadays we book an inside cabin because you can see little to nothing through the windows because it is dark. We imagined ourselves in the ambiance of an old ocean liner, it was all so shabby, and dated isn&#39;t even the right choice of words in this. It was old, broken and damaged and it seemed like Stena didn&#39;t want to spend another euro on it. We really don&#39;t think we are booking on a luxury cruise or something like that, but this was very bad. a small example, the sink in the hut hardly drained and therefore we did not even dare to take a shower. We really did not feel comfortable on the boat, and if the maintenance of the cabins also affects the maintenance of safety on the boat, we are very concerned. We have already booked for the May holiday 2024, but we don&#39;t really have a good feeling about it. The feeling is the motivation that I now want to report this to Stena. I hope you can take away this feeling, otherwise I think we would rather travel to Sweden via the bridges instead of by boat. Kind regards, Marianne and Ido Bormann Then the answer: Good morning, Thank you for your message. We will forward your feedback about the cabin to our ships on this route. Our advice is always, if you have a complaint regarding a booked cabin, to report this immediately to the Guest service desk on board so that they could have helped you immediately by checking the cabin and possibly offering you another cabin. . If they cannot offer you an alternative, they will submit a refund request to us. Unfortunately, afterwards we cannot do anything for you in this regard. Our ships go to dock every year for maintenance and inspections and comply with all safety regulations. Alissa van Drongelen Customer Service Center Answer: Dear Alissa, Thank you for the answer, although it is very unsatisfactory. It&#39;s very easy to dismiss it if you haven&#39;t complained on board, so figure it out. So you clearly have no idea what we&#39;ve gotten ourselves into. We now know that we have to find an alternative to get to our son in Sweden. The Stena is then no longer an option for us. Thank you and have a nice day, Greetings Ido NEITHER LANGUAGE NOR SIGN ANY MORE FROM THE STENA LINE I think Stena has lost another customer in this way and that for more than 800 euros for the crossing.",NL

"The detail of this review is already a complaint to Stena (CRM:05650012259) which they have refused to answer or formally acknowledge.

My Wife and I travelled on this service on the 1st of August and again (because we could not believe it could be so bad the second time) on the 8th of August. (see rest of the review for the second trip). We were totally appalled and extremely disappointed by the cabin selections and level of service available on the new ship you operate between Fishagaurd and Rosslare.

Before I made my last booking I phoned Stena office to confirm that there was a Superior Cabin available that offered Tea/Coffee making facilities and was informed that the 4 birth Superior Cabin had all I wanted and specifically the Tea/Coffee making facilities.

On boarding the Ferry it immediately became obvious that this was a figment of the Stena reservation Clerks imagination and it totally misrepresented the product Stena are selling and contravened the Trades Description Act. I complained to the staff on board and their attitude was “Take it or leave it”. The cabin we were in was also substandard, the bathroom “Stank” and the bed mattress was also useless I would have been better off lying on the floor… but there was insufficient room????. And what about Privacy Glass (there is none) in the window which looks out over the deck which passengers have access to?

We visited the Stena Plus lounge, and again yes looks pretty ..but functionally useless the choices of snacks were totally unacceptable and the coffee and tea-making facilities did not work properly.

Having survived that terrible experience we decided to wait before making any complaint until we returned on the ferry from Fishguard at 1:30 on the 8th…. And this was even worse.

Now we are in one of these “Superior” cabins and in a section that is used by those with Dogs…. I have nothing against dogs but when they keep you awake all night barking it goes way past a joke, my wife and I are in our 70s and need the rest as we have a 4-hour drive to the other end of the ferry trip with no chance of that on this trip, a total nightmare, your changes to the cabin policy for pet owners may be good for them but totally unacceptable to the majority of non-pet travelling owners I would seriously suggest.

And the second cabin has No carpet!!! I assume for pets who can’t wait??? Not a pleasant thought that you may be walking around in a space that some dog has used as a toilet??? And still no Privacy Glass in the windows, and no Tea/Coffee making facilities……

And yes the Stena Plus lounge with the same boring selection of snacks etc and I noted that you will never offer hot snacks on this new ship….. is this progress ??? you are obviously not interested in customer service or Customer Satisfaction.

And what about the sailing times on this service, normally its 3.5 hours and you use this as a positive point of difference in the marketing blurb.. so why 4 hours for this early sailing, and then when we finally docked it was a further 30 mins before we were allowed off the ferry, so that was a 1-hour delay in total and for what exactly….. and no attempt was made to apologise for the delay so I have to assume a delay is a known event .......... and do you advertise that? NO?

Finally, this new vessel for this route appears to be much smaller than comparable vessels providing similar service across the Irish Sea therefore I would imagine will become more susceptible to cancellations during periods of bad weather, but I am not an expert..",Datoen for opplevelsen: 08. august 2023,Stena Nordica what a total disappointment - never again,Vurdert til 1 av 5 stjerner,"The detail of this review is already a complaint to Stena (CRM:05650012259) which they have refused to answer or formally acknowledge.

"I travel between the UK/IE fairly regularly, I had used Irish Ferries quite a bit but after trying stena (particularly the Estrid) I switched as it is very pet friendly with the on deck kennels you can access any time.

However, I was on the Nordica this week and couldn't have had more of an opposite experience. The kennels are on the car deck out in the open, no locks for the kennels, no access to water and you can't check on them during the journey.

The fact they are just on the car deck itself doesn't seem very safe if something were to roll. A number of us who had brought pets all found it sub-standard.

"I would like to write an amazing review for all the staff at stena Ferry line on Saturday 1st July at Belfast to Uk at 330.
Clair Smith acted friendly and polite as we collected our meals.
Later on I personally scolded myself with a hot chocolate very badly. Luckily as a biker I had protective trousers on that protected my legs. Her quick actions lead to applying cool cloths while the burn kit was located. The burn jell was applied to my very sensitive stomach and done in a dignified way. A week later I have a very very small red line. It could of be hospitalisation without her quick thinking.
This was the ferry that ended in a man taking his life. Due of this understandably we had to be counted and police investigating to make sure the safety of everyone was insured and no one Acted in the death of a man.
During this the staff were brilliant they were forceful enough to insure everyone would sit to be counted in an emergency. While in the ladies toilets later on after head checks were completed, I overheard Clair reassure distressed people, cuddle dogs hand out water and later on biscuits. I would love nothing more to find this lady and thank her for extra attention and passion for the job!

Toen wij naar het autodek mochten bleek dat de auto's al van de boot aan het rijden waren. Onze auto blokkeerde een rij.

When we were allowed to go to the car deck, it turned out that the cars were already driving off the boat. Our car blocked a row. We had to get in with our dog and belongings while cars, motorcycles and cyclists drove around us and some made it clear that we were blocking things. Plus, being the last to get into our car feels like being a burden with our dog. This is completely stressful for the dog, the noise, the air.

"Zum ersten Mal Fähre gefahren, mit dem Zug nach Trelleborg und dann zum Fußpassagier-Terminal in Erwartung dass dort der Checkin vorgenommen wird, aber da war nichts, Schalter war zu. Nur die Bildschirminformation dass man einerseits 40 min vor Abfahrt mit dem Bus abgeholt wird, andererseits 60 min vor Abfahrt eingecheckt haben muss. Das war sehr konfus und ich hatte Angst dass mir irgendwas bürokratisches auf die Füße fällt! Als Fußpassagier braucht man nur rechtzeitig im Terminalgebäude zu sein, aber unter einem Checkin stelle ich mir etwas wesentlich anderes vor! Zwischen theoretischem Ablauf und Praxis klaffte eine ziemliche Lücke. Ich hätte dazwischen gut und gern noch ein Lokal aufsuchen können, das Essen auf dem Schiff war so halbwegs in Ordnung. Konnte dann für die Verhältnisse recht gut in der Kabine schlafen. Aber auf dem Rückweg gab es nochmal Verwirrung, weil der Bus in Trelleborg direkt in die Fähre fuhr, man aber in Rostock nicht schon an Deck mit einem Bus abgeholt wurde, man musste erst rauslaufen an den ganzen Autos vorbei. Wenn man weiß wie es gemacht wird, wäre es recht gut gewesen ... so war es recht kafkaesk und viel unnötiger Stress. Kann mir trotzdem vorstellen, es jetzt mit den entsprechenden Erfahrungen nochmal zu machen. Ach ja, laut Stena-Hotline soll in der Buchungs-Email eine Kontaktnummer zum Hafenpersonal stehen, da war aber keine, und als ich in Google die Nummer vom Hafen Trelleborg gewählt habe, bin ich irgendwo im Schwarzwald rausgekommen.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 29. april 2023,Für das erste Mal sehr verwirrend,Vurdert til 3 av 5 stjerner,"Took the ferry for the first time, took the train to Trelleborg and then to the foot passenger terminal in the expectation that check-in would take place there, but there was nothing there, the counter was closed. Just the information on the screen that you would be picked up by the bus 40 minutes before departure, and that you had to check in 60 minutes before departure. It was very confusing and I was afraid that I would be faced with some bureaucratic process! As a foot passenger you just need to be in the terminal building on time, but I imagine check-in to be something completely different! There was quite a gap between the theoretical process and the practical part. I could have easily gone to a restaurant in between, the food on the ship was more or less OK. I was then able to sleep quite well in the cabin considering the circumstances. But on the way back there was more confusion because the bus drove straight onto the ferry in Trelleborg, but in Rostock you were not picked up by a bus on deck, you had to walk out first past all the cars. If you know how it&#39;s done, it would have been pretty good... as it was, it was pretty Kafkaesque and a lot of unnecessary stress. I can still imagine doing it again now that I&#39;ve had the experience.

"Zelf heb ik meermaals van meerdere overtochten gebruik gemaakt (vooral Hoek van Holland - Harwich is mijn favoriete verbinding). Stena Line is één van m'n favoriete veerbootmaatschappijen.

In Trelleborg, Kiel, Hoek van Holland en Harwich heb je de trein of metro om de hoek en bij andere plekken is er goed OV naar de trein toe.

"On check in at Cairnryan the lady informed us that there had been an incident in Belfast which had delayed the ferry from docking. She advised our 19.30 ferry would be delayed by 45 minutes.
As it turned out it was delayed by over an hour.
The ferry was not the usual Superfast we normally see on the Belfast-Cairnryan route but the Stena Nordica.
The Stenaplus was much more compact but still provided the same quality of snacks etc as usual. Staff were efficient and as friendly as ever despite the complaints from annoyed passengers who were unhappy that this was not their ""expected"" ferry.
It turns out the Superfast is in dry dock having a refit and will return in 3 weeks with a larger and improved Stenaplus.
We docked in Belfast after 11pm. We found ourselves right at the front, first to disembark. However we watched as staff struggled with the ramp for approx 30 minutes, in full view of the car deck, trying to get the ramp to connect properly with the deck to allow cars to drive over it safely.

Explained I didn’t have that kind of money and otherwise would have to sleep in the van ( it’s February and cold ) to which he replied ‘ there’s a hotel up the road’. Hotel not available. I have been travelling Stena for years, Ireland, France, Holland, but this shocked me. He could used his disgretion and let me on. Very disappointed with Stena, as the Dutch would say, de klant is niet altijd koning…",EN

"Wir haben am 27.12.2022 bis heute mit der StenaLine zum wiederholten Male einen Kurztripp von Kiel nach Göteborg gebucht.
Das die Gangway seit längere Zeit außer Betrieb ist, ist zwar nervig aber über das Autodeck auf die einzelnen Etagen hat gut funktioniert.
Für das schlechte Wetter in Göteborg konnte niemand etwas dafür. Das Passagiere erst wieder ab 14.00h auf das Schiff durften, wurde im Vorwege auch so kommuniziert. Toiletten gibt es ausreichend im Terminal. Niemand muss mit zusammengekniffenden Beinen irgendetwas aushalten. Was uns aufgefallen war, ist der doch anscheinend große Personalmangel. Die Kabinen, nicht schmutzig, aber staubig. Verschmierte Fenster. Noch nasser Fußboden im Bad. Buffet. Ein Mitarbeiter für das warme Buffet/Brote. Etliche Minuten standen Gäste an und warteten auf Nachschub. Leider haben wir auch sehr viele Gäste beobachten können, die sich die Teller so voll füllten, dass die Nachfolgenden in leere Behälter guckten. Dafür kann StenaLine aber nichts. Was nervte, dass heute Morgen nur das Taste-Restaurant geöffnet hatte. Völlig überfüllt, zu recht genervte Gäste, heulende Kinder. Gäste mussten außerhalb des Taste-Restaurant ausweichen. Dann gab's keine Messer mehr. Das Wasser roch und schmeckte nach Chlor. Viele Speisen, z.b. der Käse, so kalt, dass dieser nicht einzeln entnommen werden konnte.Wichtige Durchsagen konnten aufgrund des Lärms nicht verstanden werden. Warum gab es keine Info darüber, dass das Restaurant für das Frühstück heute geschlossen war.
Deshalb von uns nur zwei Sterne. Wir kennen die Kurztripps der StenaLine besser.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 28. desember 2022,Kurztripp nach Göteborg,Vurdert til 2 av 5 stjerner,"We have booked a short trip from Kiel to Gothenburg with StenaLine for the umpteenth time from December 27th, 2022. The fact that the gangway has been out of service for a long time is annoying, but access to the individual floors via the car deck worked well. Nobody could be blamed for the bad weather in Gothenburg. The fact that passengers were not allowed back on the ship until 2 p.m. was also communicated in advance. There are enough toilets in the terminal. Nobody has to endure anything with their legs clenched. What we noticed is the apparently major shortage of staff. The cabins, not dirty, but dusty. Smeared windows. The floor in the bathroom was still wet. Buffet. One employee for the hot buffet/bread. Guests stood in line for several minutes waiting for refills. Unfortunately, we also saw a lot of guests filling their plates so full that those following them looked into empty containers. But StenaLine can&#39;t do anything about that. What was annoying was that only the Taste restaurant was open this morning. Completely overcrowded, rightly annoyed guests, crying children. Guests had to take refuge outside the Taste restaurant. Then there were no more knives. The water smelled and tasted of chlorine. Many dishes, such as the cheese, were so cold that it could not be taken out individually. Important announcements could not be heard due to the noise. Why was there no information about the restaurant being closed for breakfast today? That&#39;s why we only give it two stars.

The Harwich crossing was basically ok. This review is to warn readers to switch their phones to flight mode on boarding. There are warnings about roaming charges but most people will think that if they don’t use their phone they will be ok. Never touched mine and incurred a £20 roaming fee. I have asked them to make a ship wide announcement and I heard one. All the same stena should do more to protect busy and tired people from excess charges.

"I’ve just sailed on Edda from Birkenhead to Belfast and back. Comfortable ship, lots of seating, two movie lounges, free WiFi, electrical outlets.

Staff shortages(?) may mean that tables in the lounges are not cleaned during the voyage, children are allowed to run around, shrieking, including into the quiet Living Room area, and people get away with vaping inside.

"We Travelled back to Belfast from Cairnryan on the 23:30 Ferry on Wednesday 24th August

Unfortunately when we got home my young teenage Son realised he had lost his Mobile Phone during the crossing

I sent a couple of emails to different Stena email addresses detailing his loss - possible location on ship my contact details etc

We woke up late morning - no replies from Stena - fair enough - time is needed to sort these matters out

By about 4 o'clock we decided( you know how important a phone is to teenagers) to visit Stena terminal in Belfast to see if they could help

There where 2 members of staff on duty when we approached the desk/kiosk - we approached the lady - wrong choice - she had -

No interest in our situation
No concern for my sons loss
No intention of helping us

I thought this cannot be - this lady is a Customer Care Representative for a major company who surely empathise with customers when they loose things and try their best to locate missing item

Not this lady as well as many other unhelpful and discouraging things she said the best was "" it really wasn't worth your while coming down to the terminal to try and get this matter resolved""

It could have ended like this - however the younger gentleman sitting beside her raised his head - he had been on his computer- he quoted a number asked me was that my contact number ( he had obviously located my emails) - he asked me a few more questions - he said hold on a minute please I will make a phone call - he made the call - came back and asked my Son details about his phone in a very polite caring yet professional manner - he left again and came back confirming to my ( now delighted) Son that his mobile phone had been found

What a contrast- this gentleman

Was Interested in our plight
Showed concern for my Son
Wanted to help

Unfortunately when we got home my young teenage Son realised he had lost his Mobile Phone during the crossing

I sent a couple of emails to different Stena email addresses detailing his loss - possible location on ship my contact details etc

We woke up late morning - no replies from Stena - fair enough - time is needed to sort these matters out

By about 4 o'clock we decided( you know how important a phone is to teenagers) to visit Stena terminal in Belfast to see if they could help

There where 2 members of staff on duty when we approached the desk/kiosk - we approached the lady - wrong choice - she had -

No interest in our situation
No concern for my sons loss
No intention of helping us

I thought this cannot be - this lady is a Customer Care Representative for a major company who surely empathise with customers when they loose things and try their best to locate missing item

Not this lady as well as many other unhelpful and discouraging things she said the best was "" it really wasn't worth your while coming down to the terminal to try and get this matter resolved""

It could have ended like this - however the younger gentleman sitting beside her raised his head - he had been on his computer- he quoted a number asked me was that my contact number ( he had obviously located my emails) - he asked me a few more questions - he said hold on a minute please I will make a phone call - he made the call - came back and asked my Son details about his phone in a very polite caring yet professional manner - he left again and came back confirming to my ( now delighted) Son that his mobile phone had been found

What a contrast- this gentleman

Was Interested in our plight
Showed concern for my Son
Wanted to help

He arranged for the phone to be delivered to him and I came back about 6 hours later and picked it up

"Føj for en madoplevelse

I forbindelse med ferie har vi sejlet på ruten Frederikshavn - Göteborg med Jutlandica. Vi sidder nu ved buffet'en på dæk 8.

Vi har købt buffet begge veje og vi har da aldrig fået så ringe mad før i vores liv.
Morgenmadsbuffet var sådan set fin i udvalget. Kvaliteten er bare ikke eksisterende.

Aftensmad buffet'en er total ringe i udvalg og de få varme retter var kolde. Men til 239,- pr person forventer jeg lidt mere end tørre kyllingespyd med smag af fiskefilet, bløde slatne kyllingevinger, spaghetti kødsovs og karbonader.

Det ser ikke særlig flot ud og det virker i det hele taget som om personalet/kokken har givet op!

Vælg hellere færre retter og sats på kvaliteten. Vi spiser her ikke igen, så hellere en madpakke.

The quality is just not there. The dinner buffet is totally poor in selection and the few hot dishes were cold. But for NOK 239 per person, I expect a little more than dry chicken skewers with the taste of fish fillet, soft slathered chicken wings, spaghetti meat sauce and chops. It doesn&#39;t look very nice and it generally seems like the staff/chef has given up! Better choose fewer dishes and focus on quality. We won&#39;t eat here again, so better a packed lunch.

"Meine Überfahrt auf der Skane von Trelleborg nach Rostock war sehr komfortabel und verlief reibungslos. Bereits vor der Reise wird man von Stena Line informiert, dass für die Reise Pässe notwendig sind und wann der Check-In schließt. Für Leute, die sich diesbezüglich vorher nicht genauer informieren ein sehr hilfreicher Service!

Ebenfalls vor der Reise wurde man in einer E-Mail informiert, dass viele neue Kräfte an Bord und an Land arbeiten würden und man bat um Nachsicht, wenn diese nicht sofort alles wie ein alter Hase abwickeln können. Ich merkte aber keinen Unterschied zu sonstigen Fährreisen.

Die Kabine (4-Bett Außenkabine) verfügte, wie im Internet beschrieben, über ein Bad mit WC und Dusche, 2 untenliegende und 2 obenliegende Betten, welche sich in der Nacht als sehr bequem erwiesen. Zusätzlich dazu, was mich positiv überrascht hatte, da nicht auf der Website angegeben, war ein Fernseher mit schwedischem und deutschem Programm vorzufinden. Die Temperatur war dank einer äußerst starken Klimaanlage sehr angenehm auf konstanten 19°-20° Das Bad war bis auf die Dusche sauber, in der Dusche war ein Stöpsel mit fremden Haaren frei auf dem Boden liegend, was meines Erachtens etwas eklig ist, aber nicht zu schlimm. Bei Manchen hätte dies eventuell ein größeres Aufsehen hervorgerufen. Ebenfalls negativ anzumerken ist der etwas muffige Geruch im Bad, dabei hätte einem aber sicherlich das freundliche Personal an Bord weitergeholfen. Insgesamt aber war die Kabine sauber und schön ausgestattet. 2020 bin ich schonmal mit der Skane gefahren, dort allerdings auf einem Ruhesessel, da Kabinen zu diesem Zeitpunkt vollständig ausgebucht waren. Diese empfehle ich aufgrund meiner Erfahrungen (schnarchende Gäste, fremde Füße die plötzlich zwischen den Armlehnen auftauchen,...) jedoch absolut nicht, der Aufpreis für eine Kabine lohnt sich bei Verfügbarkeit aufjedenfall.

Das Essensangebot ist vergleichsweise gering. In einem zentralen Restaurant standen zwei Salate, ein Fischgericht, Hähnchenspieße, Schweinebraten, Kartoffeln, Gemüse, Soße und Reis zur Verfügung. Das Essen wurde hauptsächlich vom Personal auf die Teller getan. Das kann Stena Line auf vielen anderen Routen besser, wo oftmals mit einem reichhaltigen Buffet aufgefahren wird. Zusammenfassend war das Essen aber schmackhaft und sättigend.

Der Shop bietet eben ein typisches Sortiment für eine Ostseefähre. Viele Spirituosen, Bier, Wein, Schokolade und noch einige Souvenirartikel. Die Preise sind dort ok, manchmal aber auch happig, wenn eine 100g Tafel Schokolade im Katalog als Sonderangebot für 1,70€ angepriesen wird, wo die gleiche an Land 1,10€ kostet. Aber gut, das ist eine Fähre.

Das Außendeck ist schön groß mit zahlreichen Sitzgelegenheiten. Der Boden ist hier teils ziemlich verrostet, aber durch das Salzwasser völlig normal. Ein für mich wirklich wichtiges Detail setzt StenaLine hier in Sachen Sicherheit. Die Relings wurden vergleichsweise hoch gestaltet, was ein unfreiwilliges ""über Bord gehen"" praktisch unmöglich macht. Auf manch anderen Fähren bekommt man da schon ein etwas mulmiges Gefühl, wenn man sich der Reling nähert. Das finde ich sehr gut!

In Rostock kam ich dann letztlich mit knapp 30min Verspätung an, was mir bei einer 8 Stunden Nachtüberfahrt aber überhaupt nichts ausmacht. Die Ausschiffung verlief ebenso gut strukturiert und ordentlich.

Zusammenfassend war es eine komfortable und erholsame Fährfahrt. Bis auf manche Verbesserungsvorschläge habe ich nichts auszusetzen und der Hauptgrund weshalb man eine lange Fähre nach Deutschland nimmt und nicht über Dänemark fährt, dass man sich erholen kann, ist vollkommen erfüllt.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 21. august 2022,Komfortable Überfahrt mit der Skane,Vurdert til 4 av 5 stjerner,"My crossing on the Skane from Trelleborg to Rostock was very comfortable and went smoothly. Before the trip, Stena Line informs you that passports are required for the trip and when check-in closes. A very helpful service for people who don&#39;t find out more about this beforehand! Before the trip, we were also informed in an email that there would be a lot of new staff on board and on land and asked for patience if they couldn&#39;t handle everything like an old hand straight away. But I didn&#39;t notice any difference to other ferry trips. The cabin (4-bed outside cabin) had, as described on the internet, a bathroom with toilet and shower, 2 beds below and 2 beds above, which turned out to be very comfortable at night. In addition, which I was positively surprised to find, as it wasn&#39;t listed on the website, there was a television with Swedish and German channels. The temperature was very pleasant at a constant 19°-20° thanks to an extremely powerful air conditioning system. The bathroom was clean except for the shower. In the shower there was a plug with stranger hair lying freely on the floor, which I think is a bit disgusting, but not too bad. For some people this might have caused a bigger stir. Another negative point is the somewhat musty smell in the bathroom, but the friendly staff on board would certainly have helped with that. Overall, however, the cabin was clean and nicely furnished. I have already traveled on the Skane in 2020, but there I slept in a recliner because cabins were fully booked at that time. However, based on my experience (snoring guests, strangers&#39; feet suddenly appearing between the armrests,...) I absolutely do not recommend this, the extra charge for a cabin is definitely worth it if available. The food on offer is comparatively limited. In a central restaurant, two salads, a fish dish, chicken skewers, roast pork, potatoes, vegetables, sauce and rice were available. The food was mainly put on the plates by the staff. Stena Line can do this better on many other routes, where they often serve a lavish buffet. Overall, the food was tasty and filling. The shop offers a typical range of products for a Baltic ferry. Lots of spirits, beer, wine, chocolate and a few souvenir items. The prices are OK there, but sometimes steep, when a 100g bar of chocolate is advertised in the catalogue as a special offer for €1.70, when the same bar costs €1.10 on land. But hey, this is a ferry. The outside deck is nice and big with lots of seating. The floor is quite rusty in places, but completely normal due to the salt water. A really important detail for me is that StenaLine has made safety. The railings are comparatively high, which makes it practically impossible to accidentally &quot;go overboard&quot;. On some other ferries you get a bit of an uneasy feeling when you approach the railing. I think that&#39;s very good! I finally arrived in Rostock almost 30 minutes late, which is no problem for me on an 8-hour night crossing. Disembarkation was also well-structured and orderly. In summary, it was a comfortable and relaxing ferry ride. Apart from a few suggestions for improvement, I have nothing to complain about and the main reason for taking a long ferry to Germany and not going via Denmark - that you can relax - is completely fulfilled.",DE

Er waren zeer weinig of onduidelijke wegwijzers. Uiteindelijk vinden we een plekje. De airco staat zodanig koud dan ik de volledige 6 uur mijn jas heb aangehouden. We zaten binnen voor de duidelijkheid. We bestelden en betaalden vooraf eten omdat we dachten dat dit makkelijk zou zijn. Niet het geval, nergens stond aangegeven om welk uur we konden en op welk eten we recht hadden. Als we dit dan vroegen aan de mevrouw aan de kassa was zij erg onduidelijk waardoor wij dachten dat er iets mis was gegaan met onze bestelling.

Dan was het terug tijd om naar onze auto te gaan: weer foute en onduidelijk wegwijzers. Het autodeck werd niet juist aangegeven.

"Vannacht de overtocht gemaakt van Harwich naar Hoek van Holland. Tot onze spijt was dit geen plezierige ervaring. We gaan voortaan gelijk naar DFDS (waar we drie weken geleden mee naar Engeland voeren en dus goed kunnen vergelijken).
We hadden gereserveerd voor het restaurant Taste (drie gangen). Omdat de incheck en boarding pas heel laat waren, konden wij niet voor 22.30 uur aan tafel. Tot onze schrik werden we letterlijk weggekeken. Nadat we 3 kwartier aan tafel gezeten hadden gingen de lichten uit. Vooraf werd ons gemeld (bij telefonische navraag) dat het restaurant in ieder geval tot 0.00 uur open zou zijn. Dit was zo'n domper na een lange autoreis. Echt teleurstellend. Bied dan als vervoerder geen diner aan voor de nachtboot.
Verder vonden wij het heel vreemd dat er nergens aangegeven werd dat 8.00 uur aankomst NL tijd is. Op een bordje stond dat shiptime UK summertime zou zijn. Niet dus. Verder een mini tweepersoonsbed met 1 te klein dekbed. Wel een mooi schip.

To our horror we were literally looked away. After we had been sitting at the table for 45 minutes, the lights went out. We were informed in advance (when we inquired by telephone) that the restaurant would be open at least until midnight. This was such a downer after a long car trip. Really disappointing. As a carrier, do not offer dinner for the night boat. We also found it very strange that it was not stated anywhere that 8:00 am arrival is NL time.

"Stena-Line!
Leider muss ich mir mal meinen Frust von der Seele schreiben.
Ich bin jetzt weit über 40 Jahre auf der Straße zu Hause. Die Umstände meiner erlebten Stena-Line Fahrt übertrifft alles was ich bisher erlebt habe.

Ich beziehe mich hier auf die Fahrt am Sonntag den 31.07.2022 von Kiel nach Göteborg.
Wir befinden uns in der Ferienzeit, was nicht schlimm ist. Das Fährunternehmen lebt auch von den Touristen. Dennoch kann es nicht sein, das Touristen bevorzugt werden, denn auch wir LKW Fahrer zahlen für die Beförderung den aufgerufenen Preis. Die Essensausgabe die sonst getrennt war (LKW Fahrer/Touristen) war diesmal ein heilloses Chaos, es gab keine Trennung und das Essen war leider nur lauwarm. Es kam zu erheblichen Wartezeiten von mindestens einer Stunde. Bei Nachfragen wurde man von den Mitarbeitern gebeten eine andere Fährlinie zu nutzen.
Ich möchte nochmal betonen ausserhalb der Ferienzeiten lebt die Fährlinie hauptsächlich von LKW Transporten. Und ich bin erschüttert, dass wir LKW Fahrer wie Vieh behandelt werden. Wir müssen unsere Zimmer mit einer unbekannten Person teilen und das zu Corona Zeiten. Eine Kabinenteilung war bei spitzen Werten nicht denkbar.
Auf dem Deck wurden keine Abstände eingehalten und Seitens der Fährlinie wurde auch nicht darauf geachtet, sodass evtl. eine Maskenpflicht anzusetzen wäre. Die Mitarbeiter der Stena-Line im Restaurant und Rezeption werden durch Plexiglas geschützt, aber der Fahrgast leider nicht!
Was auch nicht normal ist, dass Zwischendecks kurz vor der Abfahrt für die Touristen nochmal geöffnet wird, damit die ihre an Bord gekauften Getränke verstauen können.

Darf ich noch kurz darauf Hinweisen das wir immer noch mit Corona zu tun haben und dieses ganze meine freie Meinung ist! Ich bin immer noch entsetzt, dass das mit uns LKW Fahrern gemacht wird.
Vielleicht wird dieses hier ja von einer Person der Fährlinie gelesen und regt zum Nachdenken an.

Nevertheless, it cannot be that tourists are given preference, because we truck drivers also pay the price quoted for the transport. The food distribution, which was usually separate (truck drivers/tourists), was this time a hopeless mess, there was no separation and the food was unfortunately only lukewarm. There were considerable waiting times of at least an hour. When asked, the employees asked us to use another ferry line. I would like to emphasize again that outside of the holiday season, the ferry line lives mainly from truck transport. And I am shocked that we truck drivers are treated like cattle. We have to share our rooms with an unknown person, and that during Corona times. Sharing a cabin was unthinkable when the values were so high. No distances were kept on deck and the ferry line did not pay attention to this either, so that a mask requirement might have to be made. The Stena Line employees in the restaurant and reception are protected by plexiglass, but unfortunately the passengers are not! What is also not normal is that the tween decks are opened again for the tourists shortly before departure so that they can stow the drinks they bought on board. May I just briefly point out that we are still dealing with Corona and this is all my own opinion! I am still appalled that this is being done to us truck drivers. Perhaps someone from the ferry line will read this and give them food for thought. Stay healthy everyone.",DE

"The cartel arrangement that Stena Line have with Irish Ferries have made the Irish Sea one of the most expensive stretches of water in the world to cross. It's no coincidence that fares are pretty much exactly the same with both operators.
However, the expense is not matched with a level of experience you would expect at that price level. Expect outrageous food and beverage prices, stifling hot cabins (should you be as unwise to go for this option and no towel provided on this occasion) Noisy staff using staff areas next to supposedly quiet areas like cabins and recliner lounges.

Zwei Schweden arabischer Herkunft, die Tickets gekauft hatten, wurde der Zugang zum Übergang Rostock - Trelleborg mit der Begründung verweigert, dass sie „nicht mindestens 60 Minuten vor Abfahrt eingecheckt“ hätten.

Extremely slow and delayed boarding, to the point that you won't manage dinner with your kids (even though the boarding was supposed to start at 20:00, we managed to get on board at around 21:40). In the cabin were only two blankets and two towels for our three passenger crew and they kept making very loud and completely (for us) unnecessary announcements over the whole ship (also inside cabins) way over 22:30, when our by then exhausted kid was trying to fall sleep. Also the bathroom smelled like rotten eggs and there was no soap...

This to be compared with the absolutely amazing experience on Stena Hollandica, where boarding was from 19:00, so we comfortably managed great dinner, clean nice cabin with all we needed, no nasty smells, no announcements...

"I used their dog kennels for the Cairnryan To Belfast crossing for my 10month old pup.

"I travelled on Stena Line's new route from Finland to Sweden. It was not a very pleasant excperience.

Everything is very overpriced with this company. The two-way route cost almost 300 euros and it trip really wasn't worth the price. The meals onboard cost 15 euros and they were awful. There was no drinkable water on this ship for free, not even with the meals. On our way back from Sweden the timetable was a mess. The departure time changed twice and a we had to wait 2,5 hours in the harbour just sitting in our cars. No one told us what was happening when we asked about this. The only answer was ""this is normal with Stena Line"". It also smelled like paint in our cabin and there were little small black bugs in our shower...

The most dissapointing thing was the customer service. It was rude and unhelpful.

"Waren Ende Mai 2022 mit der „Mecklenburg-Vorpommern“ von Rostock nach Trelleborg übergesetzt. Das Schiff kannte ich bereits aus früheren Zeiten, als die Fähre noch unter deutscher Flagge fuhr. Hatte das Schiff aus damaliger Zeit eigentlich in guter Erinnerung, im Gegensatz zum Partnerschiff „Skane“. Aber seit der Umflaggung ins schwedische Register hat die „Mecklenburg-Vorpommern“ leider auch den schlechten Service an Bord übernommen. Unfreundliches Personal, wenn man überhaupt jemanden findet. Hierfür vergebe ich ⭐️.
Wir hatten ein Frühstücksbüffet gebucht. Zu unserer Verwunderung schloss das Restaurant und auch der Shop unmittelbar nach Verlassen des Rostocker Hafens. Es bleibt also kaum Zeit zum Frühstück. Die Auswahl am Buffet war gering, aber ok. Vom Rührei kann ich nur abraten, da darin nicht nur das Ei, sondern auch gleich die Eierschale mit verarbeitet wurde. Wenigstens war es knusprig, aber ansonsten ungenießbar. Alles in allem war das Frühstück enttäuschend und wird mit ⭐️ bewertet. Mein Tipp, bringt Euch sämtliche Verpflegung mit, denn im Restaurantbereich darf man auch sitzen, wenn man nichts bestellt. Der Sitzbereich bleibt auch zugänglich, wenn das Restaurant geschlossen ist.
Die Kabine war ordentlich und wird mit ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ bewertet.
Ansonsten hat dieses Schiff nichts zu bieten, was aber nicht negativ klingen soll. Denn schließlich würde jede zusätzliche Ausstattung auch den Fahrpreis erhöhen, was bei dem Mitbewerber „TT-Line“ gut zu sehen ist. Dafür ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Fazit: Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist in Ordnung, wenn man die Überfahrt betrachtet. Verpflegung und Unterhaltung für die lange Überfahrt würde ich mir in Zukunft lieber von zu Hause mitbringen. Insgesamt bekommt das Schiff von mir knappe ⭐️⭐️⭐️.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 09. juni 2022,Rostock - Trelleborg mit der Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,Vurdert til 3 av 5 stjerner,"At the end of May 2022, we crossed from Rostock to Trelleborg on the &quot;Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&quot;. I already knew the ship from earlier times, when the ferry still sailed under the German flag. I actually had good memories of the ship from back then, in contrast to its partner ship &quot;Skane&quot;. But since the reflagging to the Swedish register, the &quot;Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&quot; has unfortunately also taken over the poor service on board. Unfriendly staff, if you can even find anyone. For this I give ⭐️. We had booked a breakfast buffet. To our surprise, the restaurant and the shop closed immediately after leaving the Rostock harbor. So there is hardly any time for breakfast. The selection at the buffet was small, but OK. I can only advise against the scrambled eggs, as not only the egg but also the eggshell was processed in them. At least it was crispy, but otherwise inedible. All in all, the breakfast was disappointing and is rated ⭐️. My tip: bring all your food with you, because you are allowed to sit in the restaurant area even if you don&#39;t order anything. The seating area remains accessible even when the restaurant is closed. The cabin was tidy and gets a rating of ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Otherwise this ship has nothing to offer, but that&#39;s not meant to sound negative. After all, any additional equipment would also increase the fare, which is clearly visible with the competitor &quot;TT-Line&quot;. Instead it gets ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Conclusion: The price-performance ratio is fine when you consider the crossing. In future I would prefer to bring food and entertainment for the long crossing from home. Overall I give the ship a scant ⭐️⭐️⭐️.",DE
"There is really no option but to travel with Stena Line if you’re wanting to take the ferry over to Ireland. Irish Ferries do operate the same routes but are functionally similar and differ only by tending to offer more awkward sailing times. This is the only way in which I can “recommend” Stena Line. A market so devoid of competition has become necessarily stale. If you’re wanting to take the ferry be prepared for:

1. Exorbitant pricing. Over the last several years the prices have only seemed to have risen. These rises seem well in excess of general inflation, yet the service remains at best adequate. But hey, you have no choice.

2. “Micro” purchases. Considering you’re paying through the nose you might expect to get a free coffee or similar on board. Think again. Everything costs once you’re aboard. Indeed their whole business model is focused on making you just uncomfortable enough that you consider buying their food, comfy seats or Wi-Fi.

3. Disgusting food. I may be something of an usual case here as I am vegetarian and have been for over 2 decades. I can without doubt say that their food offerings for vegetarians rank among some of the most nauseatingly inedible plates of technically food that I have ever encountered. My partner, who is not vegetarian, assures me that their more traditional food options are little better.

4. The general state of the boats. I have never sat down on a Stena Line ferry and thought to myself: “well, this is a pleasant place to spend the next few hours”. The boats are always understaffed, unclean and generally uncomfortable.

Regardless of the above you remain to have virtually no options if you want to take the ferry to/from Ireland from most of our ports. So there is little chance that the situation will improve.

"I traveled with my son on the 2300 Cairnryan to Belfast route on 1st May 2022 and there were several issues

We could only see two other people wearing masks despite the notice displayed regarding mandatory face masks. There were very few staff available to offer assistance.

2 There was no emergency safety evacuation protocol announcement.

3 Many of the football supporters were drunk and the bar still freely served them alcohol.

4 When it was time to make our way to the car decks to prepare to disembark the queue was at a standstill for a considerable time and the crowd was closely packed together. They were chanting, stomping and banging the walls. There was no crowd management and density of people crammed into the stairwells felt extremely dangerous. There were extreme levels of bad language and sectarianism and also people were smoking in the ship despite this being disallowed.

"Absolutely horrible customer service and outright lying reception!

We had the unfortunate luck to sail with Stena during Storm Eunice. We were meant to board 13:30 ship from the Hook of Holland but after getting no notification about the ship being left early we arrived at the port at 12:30 only to be told that the ship already left! All they could do was rebook us into the 22:00 departure.

We have waited 10 hours in the car park and another 2 hours on the queue to board the ship but then we were told (along with 40 cars there) the ship got cancelled at 23:30 (1.5 hours after the actual departure date, they were telling it's running late).

We didn't have any place to stay so we asked the reception for help. The lady there called several hotels to try and book us in and failed. I found some hotels and asked about the price and confirmed that it was okay with the reception. I was told to send the invoice to an email address. Then, we left the reception at 1 am.

When we finally returned to our home, I sent the invoice to the email address and didn't hear anything back for days. Then I called and I was told the email address I was giving (written on a card by the receptionist) is wrong and I should use another one.

"On a trip of endless misfortune, misled prices, missed trains, buses and planes... Stenaline has been the guardian angel to lead me out of darkness.

Firstly, I had to cut my trip short due to work reasons, but last minute flights are above my pay grade. So I was forced to reassess my options. I booked a midday Stena from Holyhead to Dublin. The payment stalled and went through twice! I had now bought duplicates, 200€ instead of 100€.
I emailed the help service team and within 1hr and 15 minutes I was fully refunded for my blunder. On a lovely one thanks to lovely Laura.

So then, I booked a train ticket from Piccadilly Manchester to Holyhead. The ticket service 'Omio', who by the way, a pack of scammers, lead me to believe I was buying 2 train tickets(24hrs prior to departure) , however I had only received 1 at the ticket booth. Long story short, I missed the train and consequently missed the Stenna. I had to pay 70£ for the extra train ticket and now expecting to be forced to book the later departure.
They offer 24h or more full refunds and a 50% refund for anying over 2hrs. Sound isnt it?

I decided to chance my arm and ask for my ticket to be amended to the later. And low and behold, The lovely Janette had responded within 40 minutes, another Stenna angel ❤️. Tickets amended at no extra cost.

"We got on the ferry from Birkenhead to Belfast at 10pm on Friday 18/2/22. We were told there will be delay while they fix the boat but we can't get off or get our car off.

At about 5:30am on the Saturday they started making plans to get everyone off the ferry. We were off late as we have a 6 month old baby (who was really not happy about any of this). We then queued for a further 3 hours in the terminal for a resolution. They promised more staff in the terminal but there was only 2 dealing with 600 people.

While in the queue, I managed to get hold of someone in the call centre at about 9:30am. We managed to change our booking to the Holyhead-Dublin Ferry. After almost no sleep, we then had a 200 mile drive ahead of us.

We then found out the Holyhead Ferry was delayed for 3 hours due to the weather (the only fair point throughout). When we were queuing for the ferry, my son was going absolutely mental - it was very distressing as we could not comfort him while the car was moving very slowly or sandwiched between cars so we couldn't open any of the doors to comfort him, feed him, change him etc.

We arrived in Dublin at about 10pm and drove another 100 miles to Belfast.

The journey should have taken 8 hours with a cabin to sleep in. It ended up taking 29 hours for us to arrive in Belfast with no cabin and a young baby. We set off at 8pm Friday from Birkenhead to arrive in Belfast at 1:30am Sunday morning.

I've contacted Stena line numerous times for a resolution and the best they could give me is a £93 refund off the cost of the trip. I originally paid £518.

They also kept blaming the weather for cancelling all trips on the Stena ""Edda"" whereas we actually know it was broken down. They did this to avoid paying out to all of the customers for a cancellation due to a technical fault. In their terms and conditions you can't get compensation for cancellations due to the weather.

We cut our trip short to avoid getting on the Stena ""Edda"" on the way home (vesselfinder.com showed the ferry had not moved since we got off it) but we somehow ended up back on it.

If your ferry was cancelled between 18/2/22 and 23/2/22 between Liverpool and Belfast, contact Stena because it's very unlikely it was due to the weather and you will probably be due compensation (although not much much because they really don't care about their customers).

"virkelig dårlig hjemmeside, og virkelig dårlig hjælp efterfølgende i kundeservice!!!!!!!

Endnu en skiferie skal bookes, og DESVÆRRE er vi tvunget til at booke via Stenaline, for det er en fast joke, at vi alle hvert år i bookningsprocessen, oplever at hjemmesiden er utrolig ringe, og alle har en eller anden dårlig oplevelse.
Jeg booker en pakkerejse med færge og ophold. Betaler depositum, og er desværre ikke opmærksom på før efter betalingen er gået igennem, at hjemmesiden ikke har registreret min valgte færgeafgang, så jeg har fået en ved aftenstid. Øv!! Jeg ringer dagen efter og taler med en (sød) medarbejder, som vil undersøge om jeg kan booke tiden om. det modtager jeg en mail på at det kan jeg til 11.50, hvilket ikke er det jeg egentlig ønskede, men accepterer, og accepterer OGSÅ , at jeg skal betale ca 500 kr, for ændringen. Selve mailen fra kundeservice forstår jeg faktisk ikke.... Den lyder følgende:
Så er der ændret.
Dit link er samme: xxxxxx
Det tager lidt tid før ændring ses online, så check i eftermiddag.

Når jeg spørger ind på færge afd. får jeg besked på at en opdatering fra din side, efter at du har booket kan blive afvist når du vil lave om, alt efter hvad der er booket og priser vi viser.
Jeg har forstået at det ikke var hvad du forklarede fra start af, da du siger du ikke kunne ændre færgen i reservations processen.
Men det har jeg fået forklaring på, når man efterfølgende vil ændre.

Så skulle det resterende jo betales, hvilket jeg går ind for at gøre. bår jeg går ind via linket kan jeg se, at der er færgeafgang tidlig morgen, og prisen der vises, er ikke meget fra den pris der var ved afgangen om formiddagen, men jeg vil gerne undersøge dette, så trykker på den og skal så trykke videre, for at se den samlede total. Her kan jeg se det bliver væsentlig dyrere, og går derfor retur og trykker på den oprindelige færge ( som jeg jo betalte ca 500 kr) for at få booket om til) Nu er det helt skørt, pludselig er der ombookningsgebyrer for 4 bookninger. Jeg vælger at kontakte kundeservice. bneder om at tale med en medarbejder der taler dansk, eller forstår dansk, da det er noget vanskeligt at forklare alt det her rod på engelsk. det får jeg at vide ikke er mulæigt, men jeg kan ringe igen senere eller vente til midt i december, så vil der igen være medarbejdere der taler dansk. Jeg accepterer ikke at vente på dette, da jeg jo har billetter der skal være styr på inden den 11/12..... Jeg bliver så stillet videre tl en anden medarbejder, som gennemgår forløbet. Han fastholder at jeg har lavet en fejl og selv ombooket disse færgeafgamge. jeg nfors'øger at forklare, at det ikke var ombookninger, det var for at undersøge prisforskellen, og at jeg da så absolut ikke for sjov skyld går ind inden for 5 minutters varighed og booker min færgebillet om 4 gange. Han siger det er ærgeligt, at det kan han ikke gøre noget ved. Det er min egen fejl, at han godt kan se det har været noget rod fra start af. Han er vældigt afvisende, og jeg ender med at sige jeg faktisk overhovedet ikke ønsker at rejse med dem, så hellere annullere min bookning fuldstændig. Det kan jeg godt, siger han,jeg skal bare lige betale over 3000 for det er restbeløbet. WHAT! Han fastholder sit spørgsmål, om han skal annullere for mig, og jeg forsøger at blive klog på hvorfor jeg skal betale yderligere. Det må vel være sådan at det depositum jeg har betalt er det eneste der er muligt for mig at miste i denne latterlige situation. Kundeservice, eller mangel på samme, medarbejderen henviser til at jeg kan sende en klage, men at der sandsynligvis ikke kommer noget ud af det. Min konklusion på hele denne stupide situation er: Stena line er fuldstændig ligeglad med sine kunder, kundeservice er en by i Rusland, og fremadrettet finder jeg andre veje til at komme til og fra Norge.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 06. desember 2021,virkelig dårlig hjemmeside og kundeservice,Vurdert til 1 av 5 stjerner,"really bad website, and really bad help afterwards in customer service!!!!!!! Another ski holiday has to be booked, and UNFORTUNATELY we are forced to book via Stenaline, because it is a constant joke that every year in the booking process, we all find that the website is incredibly poor, and everyone has some bad experience. I book a package tour with ferry and accommodation. Paying the deposit, and unfortunately not aware until after the payment has gone through that the website has not registered my chosen ferry departure, so I got one in the evening. Practice!! I call the next day and speak to a (sweet) employee who will check if I can rebook the appointment. I receive an email that I can do it until 11.50, which is not what I really wanted, but accept, and ALSO accept, that I have to pay approx. DKK 500 for the change. I actually don&#39;t understand the email from customer service... It reads as follows: Then things have changed. Your link is the same: xxxxxx It takes some time before the change is seen online, so check this afternoon. When I inquire at the ferry department, I am told that an update from your side after you have booked may be rejected when you want to change, depending on what is booked and the prices we show. I have understood that it was not what you explained from the start, when you say you could not change the ferry in the booking process. But I have been given an explanation for that when you subsequently want to change. Then the remainder would have to be paid, which I am in favor of doing. when I go in via the link I can see that there is an early morning ferry departure and the price shown is not much from the price that was at the departure in the morning, but I would like to investigate this, so click on it and then click further, to see the grand total. Here I can see that it will be significantly more expensive, and therefore go back and click on the original ferry (for which I paid approx. DKK 500) to get rebooked) Now it&#39;s completely crazy, suddenly there are rebooking fees for 4 bookings. I choose to contact customer service. begging to speak to an employee who speaks Danish, or understands Danish, as it is somewhat difficult to explain all this mess in English. I am told that it is not possible, but I can call again later or wait until mid-December, then there will again be employees who speak Danish. I do not agree to wait for this, as I have tickets that need to be taken care of before 11/12..... I will then be put on to another employee who will go through the process. He maintains that I made a mistake and rebooked these ferry departures myself. I try to explain that these were not rebookings, it was to investigate the price difference, and that I absolutely do not go in for fun within 5 minutes and book my ferry ticket 4 times. He says it&#39;s a shame he can&#39;t do anything about it. It is my own fault that he can see that it has been a mess from the start. He is very dismissive and I end up saying I actually don&#39;t want to travel with them at all, so rather cancel my booking completely. I can do that, he says, I just have to pay over 3000 because that is the remaining amount. WHAT! He keeps asking if he has to cancel for me and I&#39;m trying to figure out why I have to pay extra. It must be the case that the deposit I paid is the only thing possible for me to lose in this ridiculous situation. Customer service, or lack thereof, the employee points out that I can file a complaint, but that probably nothing will come of it. My conclusion on this whole stupid situation is: Stena line is completely indifferent to its customers, customer service is a city in Russia, and going forward I will find other ways to get to and from Norway.",DA

"Mit Freunden sind wir am 3. September 2021 von Trelleborg nach Rostock mit der Stena Line gereist, sechs Stunden Überfahrt. Corona muss an Bord ein Fremdwort sein. Keine Überprüfung beim Befahren der Fähre, keiner achtete auf Maskentragen und Mindestabstand. In der Toilette der Hinweis, dass diese letztmalig am 30.08.2021 gereinigt wurde. Ich sprach das Servicepersonal daraufhin an und mir wurde erklärt, dass man den Eintrag wohl versäumt habe. Die Toilette wurde eine Stunde vor Abfahrt gereinigt und dies erfolgt wieder nach Ankunft in Rostock - also nach 7 Stunden! Ich schätze, dass etwa 600 Gäste an Bord waren... Das Personal auf die Unzulänglichkeiten angesprochen, erhielt ich zur Antwort, dass Personal sehr knapp ist und über eine Kritik würde man sich sehr freuen. Vielleicht ändert sich dann was. Das glaube ich nicht. Dass es anders geht, bewies die Hinfahrt mit der TT-Line nach Schweden. Hier wiesen Schilder vor ausgewählten Bereichen auf die Maskenpflicht hin und auch das Speisenangebot und die Ruhe an Bord waren um Einiges besser.

In the toilet there was a note that it was last cleaned on August 30, 2021. I spoke to the service staff about this and they explained to me that they had probably missed the entry. The toilet was cleaned an hour before departure and this is done again after arrival in Rostock - so after 7 hours! I estimate that there were about 600 guests on board... When I asked the staff about the shortcomings, I received the answer that they are very short on staff and that they would be very happy to receive criticism. Maybe then something will change. I don&#39;t think so. The outward journey with the TT-Line to Sweden proved that things can be done differently. Here, signs in front of selected areas indicated that masks were mandatory and the food on offer and the quiet on board were also much better. So it works even in Corona times.",DE

10 mins before disembarking, I have a very bad fall due to a crumpled mat. Anyways the way I was dealt with was discusting. I have since lodged an official complaint. This has been dealt with in the worst manner ever. The staff have lied through their teeth to cover up the major mistakes made. 1. Not phoning me and ambulance at my request. I even offered to phone it myself. According to the assistant manager they dont like to send ambulances unless a cardiac situation. Said manager then lies during my complaint process saying she offered twice to get an ambulance. 2. Taking my 2 children aged 13 and 2 away from me with out my permission or knowledge and sending them down in the lift to wait by the bus. After a few minutes once finished telling my husband on the phone what was happening. I ask were my children are to be told they are waiting down stairs. I ask to be taken down to them to find they are not there. They have been put on the bus alone. My daughter phones me in hysterics wondering where I am. I tell her I'm on the bus.

Well during the complaint process this male staff member has gone on to lie also saying he told me and I agreed for my kids to travel in the bus from boat to port on their own.

"What a tawdry experience the Belfast - Cairnryan sailing is currently. Expensive too.
This tired and sad ship, is a pale reflection of the wonderful HSS that used to operate between Belfast and Stranraer. I’d say this crossing has an element of ‘The Land that Time Forgot’ about it, a case of regression instead of progression…

Firstly, the Breakfast: I’ve experienced it a number of times now to know it is beyond redemption; a Luke warm Breakfast Bap that is cold by the time you’ve rushed it to your table…
(By the way….do not apply any of the cheap Stena versions of Ketchup or Brown Sauce, as they seem to have been concocted by someone with a vinegar fetish!!)

Breakfast was accompanied by coffee that tasted like tar, it was the perfect foil for the bacon that tasted like it was cured in a wet salt mine.
Breakfast Bap is not cheap either, be warned, before your disappointment!

This tired and sad ship, is a pale reflection of the wonderful HSS that used to operate between Belfast and Stranraer. I’d say this crossing has an element of ‘The Land that Time Forgot’ about it, a case of regression instead of progression…

Firstly, the Breakfast: I’ve experienced it a number of times now to know it is beyond redemption; a Luke warm Breakfast Bap that is cold by the time you’ve rushed it to your table…
(By the way….do not apply any of the cheap Stena versions of Ketchup or Brown Sauce, as they seem to have been concocted by someone with a vinegar fetish!!)

Breakfast was accompanied by coffee that tasted like tar, it was the perfect foil for the bacon that tasted like it was cured in a wet salt mine.
Breakfast Bap is not cheap either, be warned, before your disappointment!

"Die uralte und rostige Fähre war ausgebucht, Chaos auf dem Autodeck, Chaos auf den Gängen. Überall lagen Menschen herum, auch in der Cafeteria wurden die Isomatten ausgerollt. Weder die Gäste noch die MA trugen eine Maske - es hieß aber, dass es Maskenpflicht gilt?! Ist doch ein Witz. In Schweden fand ich‘s total entspannt ohne die Masken, auf dieser Fähre wirkte die Maskenlosigkeit eher bedrohlich…MA allgemein unmotiviert bis überfordert, sprechen kaum Deutsch/Englisch/Schwedisch. Die Kabine war modernisiert und soweit okay, ansonsten war‘s eher dreckig. Die Mahlzeiten waren beinah ungenießbar, billig, wässrig - igitt. Und NEIN, ich bin keine Nörglerin. Reise öfters in Skandinavien, z.B. mit Viking oder Silja Line. Diese Fähren sind auch fast alle schon älter, aber absolut super sowohl vom Essen als auch vom Service her.

In Sweden I found it totally relaxed without the masks, on this ferry the lack of masks seemed rather threatening... staff were generally unmotivated to overwhelmed, hardly spoke German/English/Swedish. The cabin was modernized and OK, otherwise it was rather dirty. The meals were almost inedible, cheap, watery - yuck. And NO, I&#39;m not a complainer.

Dear Stena Line, 
I plan to travel from Rostock to Trelleborg on 10/08 in the daytime.  Due to age and health I may need to sleep on the way. Is there such a possiblity aboard and how much will it cost?

Thank you for your email.

REQUEST I do not know. This will be a ferry on 10.08 either at 7 a.m. or at 15 p.m. I was told so by a tour operator. My decision to travel depends on your answer. I understand it would be much easier with a booking reference so I am asking for a favour. 
Thank you very much

REPLY Thank you for your email.

If you have booked with a tour operator, please contact them directly to book a cabin.

If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

FINAL

Laura, my tour operator is unwilling to make inquiries. He may think there will not be enough cabins and if some passengers can have them and others wish but do not have them this will cause complaints. 
OK, if I were an individual tourist why do I have to make a booking and only afterwards find out? I explained why this is important to me. I also explained why I must know before I buy a tour not afterwards. 
I am asking a simple question. Is there avaialbility or not and if yes how much I will have to pay direct aboard. 
I hope it is not some secret. You know the date and the two alternative departues. You also know the itinerary. 
I suggest you go with this message to your management. If there is no answer for me please do not bother writing back. 
I am surprised though and if/when I share this surprise publicly there will be a few more who will be suprised

"My Daughter, her husband and 2 sons were traveling in early August from Holyhead UK to Dublin Port to visit us and my Son in Laws Parents with Stena Line for the first time since the pandemic began. Every one was so apprehensive and excited but our youngest Grandson because of the pandemic has become very anxious worrying about every little thing in life.

He so wanted to see his grandparents but was worried about something happening on the 2 hour car journey to the boat, that the weather would be bad at the port and they would not be able to sail, that there would be so many people they would not get onto the boat, the boat would leave without them and or the boat would sink or they would not be able to return to the UK once in Ireland.

While they were making their way to Holyhead I contacted Stena UK (with much difficulty) and in fairness spoke to several Stena staff who eventually put me though to the Holyhead booking office.

There I spoke to Thomas and explained my grandsons concerns and anxiety and asked if someone from Stena Line could find the time to met them and to give my Grandson some reassurance. Thomas Spoke to his line Manager and the reassured me that someone would meet the family and in fact he would do his best to meet them himself saying that he completely understood my grandson and appreciated how challenging the road and sea journey must be for his parents and brother.

A very emotional Daughter rang me from the ship and said that they were met by Thomas and that he was sooooooooooo nice and made a big fuss of our grandsons, he went above and beyond his duties to reassure our grandson and so very much to make our journey as comfortable as possible.

The family on their holiday never stopped mention Thomas and the extra mile he went for our grandson and were further taken aback when they received the same experience on their return journey.

I want to complement and thank everyone employed by Stena for all they did for my grandson and his parents and to say that they are first class people regarding customer service, I truley hope that Thomas and all the other staff only ever experience this same quality of customer support in every experience that they have and praise Stena for employing such brilliant people, especially THOMAS.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 16. august 2021,100% customer Focus and Service,Vurdert til 5 av 5 stjerner,"My Daughter, her husband and 2 sons were traveling in early August from Holyhead UK to Dublin Port to visit us and my Son in Laws Parents with Stena Line for the first time since the pandemic began.

"Eine Fährfahrt zum Kopfschütteln!

Wir schreiben das Jahr 2021, es ist August. Seit mittlerweile über 1,5 Jahren beherrscht Corona die Nachrichten und das Virus ist allgegenwärtig. Allgegenwärtig? Sicher! Aber nicht auf der STENA Fähre von Rostock nach Trelleborg!
Bei der Buchung der Überfahrt wird man auf die bestehenden Beschränkungen und Hygienevorschriften hingewiesen. Mitfahren darf nur, wer eines der drei ""G"" erfüllt, also Geimpft, Genesen oder Getestet. Kontrolle vor Fahrtantritt - negativ! Wie man am Vorabend am Fährhafen mitbekommen hat, hatte eine junge Familie keines dieser Kriterien erfüllt. Aufgrund des frühen Boardings um 6:00 Uhr war es wohl auch nicht mehr möglich, einen Test zu machen... dreimal darf man raten, wer zwei Fahrzeuge vor mir und somit ohne den nötigen Test auf die Fähre fuhr.
Auf dem Schiff kommt man sich vor, wie in einer anderen Welt, einer Welt vor dem Jahr 2020 - nur vereinzelt schaffen es die Passagiere eine Maske korrekt zu tragen, i.d.R. hängt sie, falls überhaupt vorhanden, am Kinn und dient maximal der Dekoration! Mindestabstände in der Schlange zum Restaurant, Fehlanzeige... dazu wird fleißig am Kaffeeautomaten gedrängelt! Insbesondere ein älterer Mann mit Kinnschutz fällt hier auf - er hatte wohl das dringende Bedürfnis nach menschlicher Wärme, als er sich von hinten in der Schlange an mich schmiegte... ein versehentlicher Tritt auf den Fuß stellte zumindest einen Minimalabstand her!

Zusammengefasst zeigt sich bei der Überfahrt die gesamte menschliche Ignoranz, gepaart mit Gleichgültigkeit und Egoismus! Ach die Mitarbeiter von STENA... ja die tragen die Maske meist richtig, kümmern sich aber einen Teufel um ihre Hygienekonzepte!

Aber ich wundere mich schon, wieso diese Pandemie so lange dauert...🤔",Datoen for opplevelsen: 10. august 2021,Eine Fährfahrt zum Kopfschütteln!,Vurdert til 1 av 5 stjerner,"A ferry ride that will make you shake your head! It&#39;s 2021, it&#39;s August. Corona has dominated the news for over 1.5 years now and the virus is omnipresent. Omnipresent? Sure! But not on the STENA ferry from Rostock to Trelleborg! When booking the crossing, you are informed of the existing restrictions and hygiene regulations. Only those who meet one of the three &quot;Gs&quot; are allowed to travel, i.e. vaccinated, recovered or tested. Check before departure - negative! As we noticed at the ferry port the evening before, a young family had not met any of these criteria. Due to the early boarding at 6:00 a.m., it was probably no longer possible to take a test... you can guess three times who drove onto the ferry two vehicles ahead of me and thus without the necessary test. On the ship you feel like you are in another world, a world before 2020 - only a few passengers manage to wear a mask correctly, usually it hangs on the chin, if it is present at all, and serves at most as decoration! There are no minimum distances in the queue to the restaurant... and people are busy pushing and shoving at the coffee machine! An older man with a chin guard in particular stands out here - he must have had an urgent need for human warmth when he snuggled up to me from behind in the queue... an accidental step on the foot at least created a minimum distance! In summary, the crossing shows all human ignorance, coupled with indifference and selfishness! Oh, the STENA employees... yes, they usually wear the mask correctly, but don&#39;t care about their hygiene concepts! But I do wonder why this pandemic is taking so long...🤔",DE

"Gestern mit der MeckPomm der Stena Line von Trelleborg nach Rostock gefahren. Dieser Kahn scheint wirklich seine besten Tage hinter sich zu haben. In der ganzen Fähre stank es nach Klo. In den Klo's, wenn Sie denn mal offen waren stank es zum Himmel und Klopapier gabs nicht mehr.
Ausreichend Ruheräume suchte man vergebens. Die Cafeteria wurde für die Dauer der Überfahrt von liebreizenden Familien zum Großraum-Kindergarten mit Kinder-Auslauf- und Ausrollzone mit entsprechender Akustik umfunktioniert.
Das Essen in der Kantine (anders würde ich diese Bewirtung nicht bezeichnen wollen) war, wenn es warmes Essen gab, nur mit langer Schlange zu erreichen.

This boat really seems to have seen its best days. The whole ferry stank of toilets. In the toilets, when they were open, it stank to high heaven and there was no toilet paper. There were no enough rest rooms. For the duration of the crossing, lovely families converted the cafeteria into a large kindergarten with a children&#39;s run-out and rolling-out area with appropriate acoustics. The food in the canteen (I wouldn&#39;t describe this catering any other way) was only accessible with a long queue when there was hot food. All in all, everything was more creepy than inviting.

"What we can say about this company and how they behave. Bought a trip from Sweden to Poland, and from there continue to other countries.

When you are reserving a trip they ask you 2-3 times if you don't want to buy flexi ticket but when want to cancel they don't ask you.. they are just happy if you push the button.
In the beginning of Corona when all the countries started to close the borders like rabbits, I wasn't able to contact them or to cancel the trip so lost money for that trip too....

"This is my first time on Stena (9 days ago with 3 dogs and my partner).

The ferry crossing was on time (they sent my partner a update on his mobile ~ text message and email). We waited for about a hour and a half for loading which is normal (my partner has done this crossing many times).

When we did get onboard we had to take the dogs to their dog lodge area, using a code to open the door. The dog lodge had bedding, bowls, water facilities and also had a food box if you need it. Also some doggy dirt bags and a mop and bucket. It was very clean and very presentable. We stayed for a few minutes and even thru we booked 3 cages our dogs wanted to sleep in one (we have shih tzus and they fitted in one cage perfectly.

Our room was perfect and clean. A bit hot but we had a good nights sleep . The lounge area was perfect. The gentleman behind the counter serving coffees was very friendly. We did take our coffees outside to stand outside the dog lodge area which in hindsight was a good thing. The other person that had left her dog in there come and got her dog but when she left she hadnt closed the door properly. So we could open the door without a code (it was sitting on a latch). So anyone couldve gone in there and taken the dogs. It does have a camera right above the door which could be a deterrent but thought we would just point out that the door doesnt close properly all the time.

Our room was perfect and clean. A bit hot but we had a good nights sleep . The lounge area was perfect. The gentleman behind the counter serving coffees was very friendly. We did take our coffees outside to stand outside the dog lodge area which in hindsight was a good thing. The other person that had left her dog in there come and got her dog but when she left she hadnt closed the door properly. So we could open the door without a code (it was sitting on a latch). So anyone couldve gone in there and taken the dogs. It does have a camera right above the door which could be a deterrent but thought we would just point out that the door doesnt close properly all the time.

Everything run like clockwork and even thru we had a long wait to get on we was one of the first off so it does even out.",EN

"Unsere gebuchte Überfahrt im August 2020 von Sassnitz nach Trelleborg und Retour wurde durch Stenaline mal eben schnell auf Rostock Trelleborg umgebucht, da man die gebuchte Fährverbindung eingestellt hat. Auf der Hinfahrt gab es für uns Hundebesitzer insgesamt 5 Sitze hintereinander aufgereiht in einem zugigen Gang, wo ständig Leute durchliefen. Von Corona Schutz keine Spur, alles ohne Maske. Unsere Rückfahrt wurde dann noch 2 weitere Male kurzfristig umgebucht. Am Schluss wurden wir auf eine Fähre der TT Line umgebucht. Angeblich sollte die ursprüngliche Buchungsnummer auch für TT Line gelten, aber dabei erlebten wir unser blaues Wunder. Der automatische Checkin hat überhaupt nicht geklappt. Die Buchungsnummer war bei TT Line nicht bekannt. Stattdessen mussten wir zum Checkin Schalter, wo bereits 25 Personen warteten. Dort war das Personal völlig überfordert und war nicht in der Lage, die richtige Bordkarte. Von Corona Schutz keine Spur. In dem für max. 5 Personen zugelassenen Raum befanden sich 25 Personen, alle ohne Maske, die Mehrheit rumänische, polnische und bulgarische LKW Fahrer. Nach ewiger Wartezeit wurde uns dann von einer völlig aufgelösten Mitarbeiterin irgendeine Bordkarte in die Hand gedrückt, mit falschem Namen und natürlich ohne Zugang zu einer Kabine. So funktioniert Kundenservice nicht! Wenn schon wegen zu geringer Auslastung am grünen Tisch Fähren zusammengelegt werden, dann bitte mit genügendem zeitlichen Vorlauf, so dass das Personal sich darauf einstellen kann und die Umbuchungen rechtzeitig verarbeiten kann.",Datoen for opplevelsen: 12. februar 2021,Chaotische Umbucherei,Vurdert til 1 av 5 stjerner,"Our booked crossing in August 2020 from Sassnitz to Trelleborg and back was quickly rebooked by Stenaline to Rostock Trelleborg because the booked ferry connection had been discontinued.

No sign of Corona protection, everyone without a mask. Our return journey was then rebooked 2 more times at short notice. In the end we were rebooked on a TT Line ferry. Supposedly the original booking number was also supposed to be valid for TT Line, but we were in for a big surprise. The automatic check-in didn&#39;t work at all. The booking number was not known to TT Line. Instead, we had to go to the check-in counter, where 25 people were already waiting. The staff there were completely overwhelmed and were unable to issue the correct boarding pass. No sign of Corona protection. There were 25 people in the room, which was designed for a maximum of 5 people, all without masks, the majority of them Romanian, Polish and Bulgarian truck drivers. After waiting forever, a completely distraught employee handed us a boarding pass with a false name and of course no access to a cabin. That&#39;s not how customer service works!

"Wir haben in 10/2019 ein Fährticket hin/rück (Wohnmobil u. 2 Personen) von Frederikshavn nach Göteborg für 8/2020 gebucht. Wg. Corona in Schweden und geplanter Weiterreise nach Norwegen haben wir die Fahrt nicht angetreten.
Stena Line bot ohne Aufforderung von uns an, dass dieses Ticket in offenes Ticket umgewandelt wird und wir kostenfrei bis 30.11.20 eine neue Fährfahrt in 2021 buchen können. Diese Vorgehensweise galt für Tickets, die vor (meine ich) dem 30.3.2020 gekauft wurden. Später wurde die Frist für eine Neubuchung bis zum 30.3.2021 verlängert.
Es wurde immer suggeriert, dass nur eine Umbuchung möglich ist, eine Erstattung dagegen nicht, las ich auch in Foren so.
Jetzt kommt es: In 1/2021 wollte ich das Ticket umbuchen für August (hin) u. September (zurück). Der Transfer sollte nun stattliche 125,- € mehr kosten, fand ich nicht gut. Also die Servicenummer von Stena Line angerufen und siehe da, mir wurde ohne Diskussion eine Erstattung des Tickets angeboten.

Because of Corona in Sweden and a planned onward journey to Norway, we did not start the trip. Stena Line offered, without us asking, to convert this ticket into an open ticket and for us to be able to book a new ferry trip in 2021 free of charge until 11/30/20. This procedure applied to tickets purchased before (I think) March 30, 2020. Later, the deadline for a new booking was extended to March 30, 2021. It was always suggested that only a rebooking was possible, but not a refund, I also read this in forums. Now here it comes: In 1/2021 I wanted to rebook the ticket for August (there) and September (back). The transfer would now cost a whopping €125 more, which I didn&#39;t like.

We wanted to let you know that ﻿3285﻿ of your points are set to expire by the end of the year. Don’t miss out! Book now to save money by letting your points help pay for your trip.

Points earned during 2019 will still be valid for another year.

Basically forcing us to book before 31st December or loose our points.
Terrible way for a company to treat their customers.

Rang up today and was told. To book before December or loose the earned point for 2019.

Well Stena we will go with another company and give them our Buisness. As we usually go twice a year once in the spring and once in the Autum, eat on board and book a cabin.

After all we get hit hard with the motorhome and trailer re fares,
