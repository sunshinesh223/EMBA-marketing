beautiful and the holiday started as soon as we checked in at the airport super organized and the rooms were wonderfully clean the excursion was super organized wellness super nice allround carefree package brilliant holiday always happy to come back
we have traveled with aida several times now and so far everything has always worked out great a good alternative if you booked with fti and now need a replacement trip quickly the prices have remained the same not like other replacement offers from other tour operators
hello dear aida team thank you very much for many wonderful travel moments which are organized with great attention to detail we feel completely at home and always enjoy traveling with you because we can let go when we hear quotyou are on vacation nowquot thank you very much for unforgettable emotional and beautiful memories see you on aida
from the first cruise onwards aida was the fleet i always preferred what i liked from the beginning was the good organization of the arrival and departure the fact that i could call aida at any time if i had any questions i like the friendly and helpful staff no matter what department they are in on the ship or on land
i like that aida is so environmentally conscious and doesnt want to pollute the seas any further furthermore according to the captain the technical equipment is very modern and quite safe for everyone on board i also think its great that people who are not doing well in poor countries are supported and encouraged by aida thats very strong
a cruise is always an experience and the best way to travel there is little to criticize about our cruise to the north with the aida prima the only thing we dont like is the concept of free onboard drinks in the restaurants there are some people who literally block the seats in the restaurants because the drinks especially wine and beer are included aida should think about different drinks packages that are also valid in the restaurants and bars
on our trip with the aida german was the onboard language the starting and destination port was warnemnde and we had an extensive wellness area at our disposal the staff were friendly and helpful the facilities were very tidy and kept very clean people who wanted to could take part in various wellorganized and welldesigned events there was also enough space for those who wanted to chill out
a lot was promised everything was kept and in some places expectations were exceeded i registered in the aida club straight after the trip because i want more of it
i prefer smaller ships aida sol is for me pure wellbeing and manageable the route scotland iceland and norway was beautiful in terms of scenery and wonderful weather pure sunshine i would gladly go again
aida no longer takes nonsmokers into account apparently sales are more important than anything else it feels like around to of the outdoor areas balconies and outdoor bars are smoking areas the range of drinks on offer has also deteriorated due to the new bar menu conclusion an aida cruise is not recommended for nonsmokers
once aida always aida its the total package that makes it the name club ship says it all lots of activities and a relaxed atmosphere a beautiful extremely clean ship where you feel safe and comfortable lots of delicious drinks and great organization the next trips are already booked
aida leaves nothing to be desired and you feel like you are in another world you forget everything else around you and dont think about anything else everything is beautifully decorated and the colors are well coordinated you are like a different person on the deck and you switch off completely we would love to come back it was simply fantastic
this trip was a great experience and the staff were so incredibly nice friendly and harmonious we have never experienced anything like it before keep it up we will definitely be back
it was very nice on the aida everything was very well organized and clean the excursions were fantastic my expectations were fulfilled i had great experiences and am looking forward to my next trip with aida
was happy in all areas i just think that the range of excursions is too high what i miss most is the officers chaken
i started a new life with the trip with aida prima i feel full of energy my health is also better than before the vacation
and another great trip we love all ship classes each has its own highlights and routes just give it a try
it was already my th cruise of which were with aida from the very beginning i was very enthusiastic about the quotaida feelingquot and the possibilities that you have on a cruise and therefore i often recommend aida
nice week to relax food and drinks very good good climate friendly staff
aida is generally perfect for rest and relaxation excursions are very expensive but some excursions are worth the money you should find out about the location etc beforehand
at aida you feel well looked after allround care great excursions but a bit overpriced
my first cruise with aida was great it was simply fantastic and i would love to come back on board
uncomplicated travel and getting a taste of new citiesthere is something for every manwoman be it the evening program the food the sport and the spayou can feel good in any case
the whole trip was a great experience that i will fondly remember
we were again very satisfied with the trip and the aida company
aida makes every trip an experience it feels like being part of a big colorful family and often many new friends join you
amazing tour with eidfjord bergen vik gothenburg aarhus and olden from warnemnde the tour is well worth seeing
everything was just perfect nice trips helpful information great entertainment and bands
you step on board and are in another world you are pampered all around and can enjoy your holiday with all your senses
all in all nice holidays with a good priceperformance ratio when travelling with teenagers
as expected the cruise with aida fulfilled our wishes we are very satisfied
would give stars if i could thank you for an unforgettable trip
in terms of landscapes foods and price aida norways fjords cruise is highly recommended
it was the small moments and the magnificent nature that made the experience lasting
it was a beautiful and unforgettable trip
seeing the world is simply a dream reaching these destinations on a ship is madness
it was a very nice time throughout both on board the aida perla and during the shore excursions
thank you for the wonderful trips so far you are the best
it was a uniquely beautiful and eventful cruise with aida diva
aida always happy great crew great service
it was a successful and relaxing holiday with aida
overall it was a great trip especially the city tour in barcelona
its a wonderful thing to travel on a cruise ship you can experience and see a lot in just a few days

great trip
it was a special experience a cruise like this is and remains something special i was looking forward to it for months everything was more than i could have imagined
fantastically beautiful and great excursions
when booking this cruise we wondered whether it would be worth the money we can wholeheartedly say quotit was worth every euroquot it is striking how friendly and helpful all crew members are the ship is also incredibly clean in every square inch this is very important to us we would like to thank the aida cruise crew for this wonderful week
never been so happy with a trip the staff were absolutely amazing friendly throughout comfort friendliness cleanliness entertainment and quality in all areas were absolutely surpassed a big thank you to the entire aidanova crew we will be traveling with aida for the next few years
an unforgettable vacation on the aidanova dream vacation ill be back
everything is well planned so that you can go on holiday without worries but the excursions are far too expensive
the ship aida cosma is magnificent and a mustsee just dont go during school holidays because then there is just too much going on at the pool and in the surrounding area which is of course normal but does not mean relaxation for adults without children
it was a very nice trip and at the same time it was a highlight because we were able to celebrate our golden wedding on your ship on june
very nice trip also great for company parties and events
great trip
first cruise with exceeded expectations the aidadiva is rather small with around guests there is enough space on a total of decks the balcony cabin on the port side is very nicely located spacious and clean i would consider the restaurants with food to be in the star range bars and spa and fitness areas are sufficient and well available service and crew are simply top notch we will be repeat offenders
a wonderful short trip with old friends
a great priceperformance ratio great service from all employees a warm atmosphere and many wonderful experiences made our trip one of the most beautiful
very good provider and wonderful well organized trips
dream holiday
the trip fully met the usual expectations and experiences of previous trips
i felt completely at home on the aida cosma everything was just right here this was not my last aida cruise
good varied food and great excursions
had a great day trip to the mediterranean nothing to complain about
an exciting northern route with a great crew on the aida sol id love to go again
overall i was very satisfied but there are small things that could be improved but overall it was a great trip
great weeks on aida cosma im looking forward to the next time
everything about the trip was perfect
a great trip with wonderful experiences and great destinations
great norway trip with a great aida nova crew
days aida cruise relaxing like days hotel vacation
the aida cruises are perfect for traveling with the whole family whether young or old there is something suitable for everyone
we went to norway on the aidanova and it was our first cruise i traveled alone with a fiveyearold child it was one of the best holidays i have ever had a really great community you feel like part of a community the service staff and the entire crew are very very friendly and above all childfriendly my daughter and i had a very happy trip and are already looking forward to the next cruise
all the moments together remain beautiful every day anew
all in all it was a great trip on which i was very relaxed the service on board was first class i would gladly do it again
it was a wonderful trip with lots of impressions lovely excursions lots of nice people and great staff who were always very friendly
very nice aidaprima short cruise to zeebrugge and rotterdam despite the rain and wind a lovely experience with our granddaughter
basically in my opinion freezing on a ship is a wonderful experience to go on holiday like that i could only say that after i experienced it myself on our last trip the canaries with cosma however the automatic slamming of the cabin doors which was so loud really got on my nerves but that was really the only negative thing
our first aida cruise all expectations were fulfilled now we have become real fans sooo quickly we will be back on board soon many thanks to our family and friends it was a very special gift from you
beautiful and rare route of the aidasol in the english channel and bay of biscay
it was a great trip everything was great great team on board i felt completely at home
it was my first time travelling with aida and also my very first cruise i have to say i was and still am thrilled everything was perfect the staff the helpfulness the cleanliness the food a dream with a huge selection and the evening programme was great and of a very high standard i cant say anything about the excursions as i explored the cities on my own thank you for these great experiences and impressions
magnificent trip with the aida perla to norways fjords a dream
from the arrival to the end of the trip everything was very well organized by aida compliments for that all the crew members were also very friendly the quotcuisinequot on board could still be improved but you can always find something
nice trip we were very satisfied and learned a lot of new things always happy to do it again
nice trip great ports and cities in great hands on the mar for us only adia
beautiful experiences on the trip with the aida nova including the comfort in the veranda comfort cabin
we really enjoyed the aida trip again
great trip to norway lofoten and north cape unforgettably beautiful
everything from beginning to end of the trip was great
our baltic sea trip to denmark and norway on the aida nova was a complete success good service friendly staff and very varied and delicious food rounded everything off perfectly we will travel with aida again
it was our first cruise and it was a wonderful experience
i cant rate it it was a holiday im overwhelmed with the question
these trips are simply beautiful and it is a dream to travel with aida because everything just fits
very nice spontaneous vacation on the aida nova in the baltic sea as always an unforgettable experience for me and my son
unforgettable moments lovely people great atmosphere a wonderful ship
my first aida cruise a dream came true the food was fantastic the staff everything was perfectgoose bumps pure leaving warnemnde was amazing the people on land applaudedeverything was very very nicewe will be backlg
it was a very nice trip with many sights
wonderful holiday
great experiences on land in norways fjords the air is clear the land is wild and on board you can always enjoy everything hardly any other holiday can keep up with that if the weather is bad you just do something inside
great service great excursions all around good
a beautiful trip to the eastern mediterranean with beautiful ports great historical experiences with contact with antiquity beautiful old towns with history relaxing days at sea round off a wonderful holiday
we travelled with the aida nova beautiful ship good staff good food good ports
good travel destinations very well selected long layover times top
we are two married couples travelling with aida nova for the first time to oslo from kiel we really liked it especially the organisation on the ship excursions on and off ships the entertainment and food cabin and the bars were very clean the staff in the restaurantat the reception always tried to fulfil the wishes of the guests we were completely satisfied and will soon be heading north from kiel again to explore the world
everything was well organized friendly crew always with a smile and kind words
great trip we felt very comfortable on the ship
the trip was simply wonderful with aida
it was another great trip got to know some great countries and there were some great cities too great trip
aida norway very relaxing and beautiful nature but unfortunately not as nice on the cruise ship as i remembered
great trip with aida great crew amp overall experience
aida offers pleasant holiday experiences for all age groups the service is friendly and courteous overall the atmosphere is brighter and friendlier than other cruise operators
very nice trip to norway now we are back home and we really enjoyed it very nice staff on the aida perla everything was very clean we are planning the next trip
i have been traveling regularly with aida for years and am always thrilled when i can wake up in a new place almost every morning the cleanliness on board is unique as is the selection of food in the buffet restaurants the evening entertainment is of a high standard and cannot be compared to some of the quotcheapquot entertainment that i have experienced in various hotels i usually travel alone and can fully recommend this type of vacation for singles too
all in all a nice trip
great employees good team spirit norway is a great destination
this was my second time on the aida and i am always amazed at the effort that is made for the travelers you dont lack anything percent wellbeing
a great cruise like this
a trip to norway with the aida perla that we will always dream about recommendation rate for the crew and the services on board
always happy already the th cruise with aida
we had a lovely relaxing holiday everything was well organised and the excursions on land were very well supervised and sometimes very informative very good food on board friendly and courteous crew
i always look forward to this holiday because they always try to make you feel comfortable on board you can do everything but you dont have to the staff is always very friendly
it was a great trip with many positive highlights
from the beginning of the trip to the end you feel in good hands problems with arrival and departure are resolved whenever possible you can leave everyday life behind the crou always radiates friendliness no matter what area they work in
enjoying the trip with my twin grandchildren
great trip with a great crew and great cruise line
it was another great trip despite a lot of traveling we got to know new places we felt very comfortable and our grandson years and months old cried a lot when we left he wanted to go back to dodo
pleasant trip highly recommended with
nice first cruise
it was our first cruise and our expectations were exceeded it was so great and beautiful the warmth on board from every single member of staff
experiencing impressive nature with the aida is easy
the aida nova may be a great ship for families but its extremely difficult for travelers who want peace and quiet its almost impossible to avoid the noise of children it wasnt for us if that doesnt bother you theres a lot to choose from
great family ship
very nice holiday i can only recommend it
we were on the aida cosma from the end of may th to the beginning of june th i have to say a lot of praise its a really great ship we treated ourselves to days of vacation and this cruise in particular from barcelona to barcelona so from spain to italy to france and back to spain the food was very good and the crew was very nice and helpful the captain was a really nice and friendly guy you cant take any stars off and i dont have to we were rebooked on a later flight technical problems which worked out great i would do an aida cruise again and again its really worth it thank you for the wonderful days
wonderful aida holiday would go back anytime great staff super friendly excellent layover times in the ports top organisation whow
a cruise for euros with two small children on the aida cosma outside of the holidays a slightly better standard veranda deluxe cabin with a pointless winter garden and a second tv nobody needs that the staff were friendly and the trip was fine apart from a few delays however the pool area at the front was forbidden for children but you were allowed to join the drunks at the infinity pool at the back more noise than with children and the smell of cigarettes it was my daughters birthday during the trip there wasnt even a bag of gummy bears no attention we booked a cake with a decorated table for an extra charge cake ok decoration was a white tablecloth also definitely dont book a massage package in advance you do the first one online you get fobbed off on the ship and the other massages are either very early or very late great times for families just awful the main thing is that they want the money in advance otherwise you unfortunately notice that its all about getting money out of your pockets
it was a great time on the ship the holiday was a dream
aidanova gladly againpure vacation relaxed travel
it was an unforgettable beautiful trip on the aida nova a great friendly and always helpful crew we found great people in the crew and among the enthusiastic people we were able to really enjoy the great landscapes and we learned a lot about the technology on the ship in lectures simply a great trip
we took the metropolis tour with the aidaprima for the second time and were able to discover completely new landscapes the aidaprima is a great ship and the service and amenities represent good value for money we had a great rest and are looking forward to the next cruise in four months
the travel routes
simply a great holiday for the whole family you just feel at home at aida
after years we went on an aida cruise again we were very pleasantly surprised great food friendly staff nice conversations with enthusiastic people this is probably due to the small ship the excursions are just a bit overpriced apart from that great praise
a family trip to remember
the very coordinated and well thoughtout aida travel experience concept left little room for real relaxation experiences and surprises there is no room for maneuver that the migrant crew can use despite the great films and advertisements profit maximization makes aida trips not a showcase experience and as is the case in many cases in this and other industries customers will sooner or later perceive this voices on board from multiple aida travelers about the changed modalities and the way travelers are treated which of course remains wellformed but not always exciting and competent in finding solutions confirm my individual view childcare was too limited and there was hardly any youth framework or program in reality despite the offer listed on paper overall i and probably many aida travelers are missing the crucial corner in every corner that was lost due to optimizations and the staff
i really enjoyed my holiday nice atmosphere delicious food great balcony cabin good facilities it was great for me
my vacation on the aida was simply perfect from start to finish culinary highlights relaxing moments breathtaking shore excursions excellent service in summary my vacation on the aida was an unforgettable experience full of luxury fun and relaxation i can hardly wait to spend my next vacation on an aida ship many thanks to the entire aida team for this wonderful time
all in all a very successful vacation on the aidacosma the entire ship the cabin the crew the food the entertainment on board everything was unforgettable even the journey there was aidalike perfect well be back promise
all in all a successful holiday with a few rough edges but overall they dont justify losing a star id say a good the silent party was amazing put your headphones on and listen to what you like
i like traveling with aida i like the ships unfortunately many things are overpriced like the shore excursions for example the food was good the cocktails not so much the restaurants were very crowded
a trip with aida is always something special the good atmosphere on board and the committed crew from room service to the captain everyone tries very hard to give the passengers a great holiday experience
great trip but the excursions were very expensive
the trip was very nice the excursions unfortunately overpriced for example take my ship
this trip was once again a highlight
was a great cruise
aida has made it possible for me to fulfill a dream with a trip to norway both on board and the excursions were really nice i also found the diverse crossgenerational composition of the cruisers to be pleasant i hope to see you again soon on an aida ship
we had a very nice holiday and were very well looked after everything was perfectly organised we were always kept fully informed about everything to do with the trip very well and always in a timely manner the food in all the restaurants was very good the entertainment in the theatrium with its artists and singers was excellent the entire team from the captain to the service did an excellent job
nice suite long waiting times at the bars during the day
norway fjords and aida everything is right
we have been traveling with aida for many years but this was the first time we were on board after corona unfortunately it is no longer like it used to be the service is completely lacking its a shame so we are considering whether we will travel again in the future
great vacation on board the aida and the norwegian fjords the overall package was right good food good entertainment unfortunately there is a point deduction in this rating agreements made in advance with the onboard hospital were unfortunately not kept
aidacosma days in the mediterranean great modern ship lots of good restaurants and lots of opportunities for activities and wellnesssports unfortunately it also has the virtues of german holidaymakers gtgt sun loungers are already occupied at am and very bad taste in clothing although long trousers are required for dinner you wear unsuitable shorts from kik or penny and a camp david shirt over them and the matching sandals and socks
everything is great see you on aida
it was great see on aida
the cruise with aidacosma was as beautiful as always but the arrival and departure with air nostrum in the mini plane was very disappointing
a trip with aida is worth the money
our first cruise as a family with two teenagers was a great experience of course the aida cosma and all its possibilities couldnt be explored in a week we visited some great ports in the western mediterranean the service food and drinks were simply firstclass and of the highest quality in retrospect the only small drawback was the two inside cabins we booked on our next trip well be taking a window cabin
it was our first cruise with aidaprima it was perfect and incredibly beautiful
the aida cruise itself was very nice but the paris excursion quotparis on your ownquot was not worth the money the journey there and back was too long with traffic jams so we only had a little time in paris incompetent tour guide
it was a good experience to travel on the aida with our grandson again after a long time we were completely surprised how much we enjoyed it on the aida after four years of quotsailing abroadquot on many other cruise ships with worldwide routes the quality of the market restaurant and the other restaurants was simply superb although as on the other ships or on land it took a little longer to bring water or wine we can therefore imagine going on an aida trip again and are already busy looking for the next suitable routes
beautiful travel destinations an impressive large ship with a lot of service culinary options and shows invites you to relax and unwind the spa program is very balanced and very good despite a change in route the travel destinations were very beautiful and worth seeing so much so that it makes you want to see more
had the best holidays with aida never again on another ship
pure mass tourism and ripoffs on the entire ship although we know aida and have been there three times it will be our last trip aida has gone downhill a lot
overall a great trip on the aida diva unfortunately some of the staff are not as friendly as you would normally expect on a cruise
since it was our first trip we were completely satisfied
nice trip great people super family friendly
always happy to go back to aida a great overall package of beautiful destinations service and good food on board great entertainment and nice new people
if you manage to actually get involved in the holiday mentally you can have a fantastic and relaxing trip in a great atmosphere
a unique holiday on the mediterranean on aida cosma fantastic destinations topclass service incomparable culinary well be back
we are a family of four with two children aged and our first cruise was on pentecost on the aida cosma it was a wonderful vacation where everything was just perfect the rooms the food the entertainment the shore excursions and the experience of traveling on a boss thank you dear aida team we will be back lt
great crew nice organization of the trip and the course of the trip
aida was as always a very special experience
a very nice cruise everything on board was really great but the trip to copenhagen was very poorly organized
briksdal fascinating glaciers
great cruise but of course there are always things you dont like its a matter of taste
in general aida is really great on the sphinx class ships the nova is too big too loud and there is no central point the opening pool party was really missed and above all this quotyoure on holidayquot feeling
unique luxurious travel experience
everything was great from the beginning even the weather was good
we had a wonderful cruise with the aidaprima the crew was very accommodating and friendly the food was delicious and the entertainment was great
its always nice to go on holiday with aida always an unforgettable holiday thank you for aida
the boat trip remains a beautiful memory
it was a really great trip
a completely carefree holiday aida takes care of pretty much everything from checkin to checkout if there were even bigger pools available on sea days almost everything would be perfect the quality and variety of the food was impressive
aida prima the sister ships are clearly better
overall it was a great and impressive holiday pure nature
my hotel shows me the world
an unforgettable journey highlights at the arctic circle
i cant complain for me the trip was good
you get addicted unfortunately always world class on all our trips with aida we are already looking forward to june th
wonderful trip with relaxing character and feelgood moments
great trip nice friendly staff the rooms were always clean the entertainment program was extensive there was something for everyone
many countries in a short time and not a moment of boredom
the th vacation with aida as always everything was great well be back
it was another lovely holiday just be careful when booking if you are travelling during the holidays
this was our second trip with aida this will also be our last vacation with aida last year we had a very relaxed vacation on the aida nova with our children this time week western mediterranean there was no relaxation everything on board was completely overcrowded at every meal there were long waits for a table a gauntlet to the buffet and back again most of the staff seemed overworked and listless on the sunny days at sea it was completely impossible to get a lounger there were always long queues at the bar many fellow travelers said the same thing and did not want to travel with aida in the future positive good plentiful food clean cabin with very good room service great shows in the theatrium but overall the above points were so decisive for the vacation week that we were far from having a relaxing effect in the end all of us were happy to be able to get off the ship again what a shame because everyone was really looking forward to the cruise and the fun isnt cheap either
aida is worth travelling and sailing with you can experience and enjoy a lot of the world always happy to
with aida you can rely on consistently good and consistent service you are not pressured into anything no active entertainment but have countless options for spending the day ships are clean and are regularly quotmaintainedquot it is definitely time to relax
beautiful harbors great excursions different food and something for everyone
everything is offered for the perfect holiday and wellbeing
this was the third time ive travelled with aida in the last months and as always it was really good very friendly staff and everything was well organised the booking was very professional and with the help of the aida travel agency i was even able to get a return flight from munich airport even though it was fully booked to begin with
if you want peace and quiet please do not book during the holidays otherwise up to a quarter of the guests are children
an unforgettable holiday the staff is very friendly and helpful
very relaxing holiday with my granddaughter
we look back on a wonderful cruise in norway with a super friendly team great artists and beautiful landscapes and ports we can only recommend it to everyone we will be back thank you aida
very good atmosphere great restaurant and buffet selection something for every taste great service staff always happy to come back once aida always aida
great trip with great people and an outstanding crew everyone gave their best and made the trip unforgettable
all in all a nice trip
everything went well from the beginning to the end of the trip
the cruise was a way for my husband and me to come back from the last difficult weeks
the entire trip was very well organized and we always received good and important information
overall a nice trip
it was a wonderful holiday for us and our grandchildren aged and my husband and i have been on the aida several times and wanted to introduce it to our grandchildren they really enjoyed it and on the train ride home they asked if we could do it again next year that was the best confirmation for us
great crew and great ship thank you for the unforgettable moments see you next time on aida
an allround great holiday with the whole family relaxation in a lovely atmosphere with very friendly staff the fjords of norway with the aida are something you just have to experience
a trip to norway with the aida diva is simply fantastic
super nice trip on the aidablu in the mediterranean good food nice staff good weather beautiful locations what more could you want
great trip great service
aida is always worth a trip great britain norway tour is really very interesting
it is always an experience to travel to different countries and cities with aida in comfort and with high standards of quothotel standardsquot i love having my quothotelquot with me at all times and being able to travel safely and comfortably from a to b via c i like the casual club character on the aida ships
pure relaxation without thinking and considering just enjoying the days without stress and with lots of friendliness
since my first cruise on aida many of the offers have been scaled down and yet always aida
aida is always great if it werent for the mass transport of children when sailing in germany
traveling on the aida cosma as a single person i spent a lot of money for little holiday comfort and relaxation too many people and not enough service to keep up with all the hustle and bustle requests and orders in a timely manner the many small pools are completely overcrowded so the water quality is no longer really inviting for swimming free tables to eat or loungers to sunbathe on are in short supply the confusing layout of the individual decks means that it is difficult to find your way around the advantage is that it is no problem to complete your steps by midday due to the long walking distances the very expensive excursion i booked left a lot to be desired and was an imposition i am now curious to see whether aida will be accommodating here conclusion i will take the next cruise with a different provider
once again a great trip booked a short trip at short notice and we were not disappointed always happy to travel with aida
unfortunately the aida mar is ready for an overhaul we have been traveling with aida for years and will do so again but unfortunately they are significantly reducing their service and choice of expenses unfortunately
everything was super organized outward journey return journey holiday everything perfect
fun relaxation and seeing new beauty of the world
good family trip
it was such a lovely week with all the excursions and activities on the ship
this trip was impressive very beautiful
it was a lovely experience on board everyone was very friendly and accommodating the ship offers a lot of variety and great destinations
allround successful trip
that my grandchildren were always well looked after throughout the entire trip and i was able to enjoy the time on board
great scenery in the fjords
highly recommended great trip we are looking forward to the next one
an allround successful trip
the whole holiday was just perfect
everything went really well on the trip we were able to relax met some nice people and the weather was great too
i made the trip for the second time and can see the difference
was a nice trip only smoking on the neighbours balcony was not so nice
the trip itself was beautiful new ports interesting excursions and great weather the enjoyment was somewhat dampened by the very high prices of the excursions and the new bar menu which had less choice smaller cocktails but significantly higher prices
i was very impressed and thoroughly enjoyed my trip on the aidastella from the service to the entertainment everything was perfect
great trip everything was top
my first sea voyage ever i dont want to give anything away im completely blown away
aida nova a huge skyscraper on the water a crazy number of people very cramped and hectic basically a real club holiday unfortunately the service staff were quite dull and listless the music in the party hall was bad and the dance floor was almost always empty the mini pools were full of hundreds of people like sardines in a can hmm i imagined the trip to be a bit more luxurious at these prices
another wonderful trip
great trip aida is simply brilliant
very nice cruise service and organization as well as entertainment programs were very good food was great would definitely go again
an allround beautiful trip the ship has enough potential to let your soul unwind
i have already traveled with aida times
scandinavian highlight from kiel it was a very nice trip with fantastic weather and culinary delights we would travel with aida again at any time but probably not during the holidays because then there are too many children on board
aida is ideal for families too many children and very chaotic not ideal for couples without children or singles not a relaxing cruise quite the opposite
we had a wonderful holiday but would not book the aida nova again because of its size families with children will feel very comfortable but for us it was much too big and too loud we would prefer the smaller ships in the future
great trip great ship good entertainment perfect food no more cruises during the holiday season its my own fault
the trip on aida nova was a wonderful experience
was a nice holiday
beautiful ship great crew great trip
the trip was super great
so many destinations in such a short time simply beautiful
respect for the staff i take my hat off to them the trip was very impressive everything was perfect i would definitely use aida again
it was a nice vacation
fantastic trip and good service in all areas
successful trip great ship great crew great team overall delicious food well be back
everything was well planned and organized by aida
we always have wonderful moments on board and meet carefree and openminded people discovering the world at the same time thats what makes the trip unforgettable
its always nice with aida the only thing is that the excursions should have a germanspeaking tour guide as it is a german ship and there arent two other cruise ships in this port aida needs to come up with something or offer fewer excursions otherwise it was a wonderful trip
aida does everything to satisfy its guests i spent the best holidays of my life there
the expectations we had for our first trip with aida were completely exceeded the help and friendliness on board is simply superb as we are dependent on a disabled service we were helped in every way the next trip is already booked and we will spend our next vacations on board aida as for us it is also the best way to spend a relaxing vacation we should have done it much sooner
aida cosma is an amazing ship it is huge clean and new the cabins are soundproof you will not hear the ship docking at night if you have a natural sense of direction you will still get lost but you have plenty of time to stroll the buffet restaurant are great huge variation and selection remember that everything is in german including the app when you arrive you will be able to get into the ship immediately so if you arrive early that is a huge advantage
we enjoyed every day of our day honeymoon and would like to thank the entire aida crew team for that we would definitely love to travel with aida again and have already recommended this type of travel several times
it was our first short trip with aida to see how much we could tolerate it and how we liked it but what can i say totally overwhelming and fantastic everything worked smoothly and everyone on board was always friendly well some german guests could learn a thing or two from that i will definitely plan and book the next trip with aida
wonderful mediterranean cruise with many beautiful moments very good service in all areas very good food selection diverse entertainment options we can highly recommend the aida cosma
my first trip with aida the support before the trip has been very good so far
you have fully fulfilled the promise of a carefree holiday
it was an allround beautiful and eventful honeymoon cruise with a great ship a top crew beautiful destinations and lots of wonderful moments the fantastic weather made everything perfect
we had a very nice short trip and are looking forward to seeing aida again
a cruise is the most convenient way to travel to many places and countries in a short time and make the most of your vacation
norway in beautiful sunshine with degrees no rain what more could you want
great atmosphere on board friendly staff interesting travel destinations good value for money perfect for relaxation peace entertainment party city trips culinary delights and sports
a great overall package for a successful family holiday where you can discover the world
we just love aida everything is top notch and you can get to know all the countries in a week or two super
travelling at sea is always an experience
overall a nice trip however the inappropriate and disruptive behavior of some of the poorly behaved and classy fellow travelers was simply tolerated and not stopped in any way
the trip with aida was very impressive
from the booking to the execution of the trip we felt like we were in good hands
more and more additional costs at aida the last time we were on an aida tour was in after that only meinschiff and msc we have now traveled with aida again and were surprised by the many negative changes for example the sauna costs extra the kidsclub can only be used within a limited time slot even if you fly with aida you are not allowed to stay on the ship on the day of departure but are taken to a hotel to bridge the gap until the airport transfer there are no free baby monitors or diaper pails available only for a fee unfortunately aida has not won us back
traveling with aida is always like an allround carefree package
travel the way you like theres something for everyone hotel rooms are always included as are good food and impressive shows
a wellplanned cruise with aida in beautiful norway highly recommended
it was our first time on a cruise and we had a lot of fun i can only say we will do it again
after a trip with hurtigruten the trip on the aidamar was my first cruise with aida it was clear to me that there would be big differences both in terms of price and quality if you like a package holiday in a holiday resort you will probably feel quite comfortable with aida if you are looking for peace relaxation and rest at sea you should not travel with aida the ship was full colorful and loud the buffet restaurants in particular were constantly overcrowded loud and hectic finding a place there was a challenge it really annoyed me i imagine something different when it comes to vacation but i knew more or less what to expect aida is not a bad choice for a cruise with children thats why i dont want to judge the trip too badly i liked the balcony cabin with the fantastic view the ports of call in denmark and sweden were also beautiful on the other hand i found the guided shore excursions overpriced and unsatisfactory we spent a lot of time on the bus and had very little time to move around freely on site the best shore excursion was therefore the one where we went off on our own i found the interior of the ship a little disappointing i have to say i like the ships better from the outside the style of the interior is not my thing too colorful too messy and a little dated overall i found the trip quite expensive for the quality offered despite the balcony cabin hurtigruten was significantly more expensive but the quality was on a completely different level i dont want to rule out going on an aida cruise again but only because of my children personally i felt much more comfortable on board hurtigruten the trip on the aidamar was an interesting experience but not a relaxing vacation for me
once again a great holiday with aida everything was perfectly organised and the crew was great and attentive as well as a very familyfriendly travel option
the trip was fantastic the crew of the aida stella was extremely friendly and helpful
all roundvery professional travel arrangements and friendly staff
travelling with aida always has something special about it you see a lot of the world and are in a different place every day
aida provides comprehensive and detailed information the company has very good service great staff and beautiful ships
a great holiday with the ship and the inspiring shore excursions
beautiful trip friendly staff super aida show thank you for everything
it was our first cruise and we were very satisfied the service was first class as was the range of food and drinks we liked the cabin as well as the entire ships facilities there were lots of leisure activities the excursions were well organized and interesting all in all a great vacation and we would definitely go with aida again
aida is always great besides traveling by car its the most varied way to travel in addition its always easy to get into conversation with others and meet nice people on aida
as always good relaxation on a great ship
i thought i had booked a cruise with aida but i felt like i was at ballermann the standard drops with every trip fortunately there are other providers
it was a beautiful trip unfortunately not always with good weather but with beautiful and interesting destinations we will remember it for a long time
it was my first cruise and my expectations were completely fulfilled and exceeded
it was a beautiful trip that we will remember for a long time i hope the feedback i gave you is valuable for you and changes it
beautiful trip
good food great entertainment very friendly and helpful staff always nice to travel with aida
it was an allround successful trip
well organized trip from start to finish a fantastic crew that gave it their all it was simply fantastic we will be back on aida soon
the trip was well planned everything went smoothly the service and food were very good we really enjoyed the excursions we booked especially aarhus
great ship
aida really good in service offer and holiday feeling
it was my very first cruise and it was great on a ship where you understand the language well and can find your way around very quickly and ask the crew if you need help id be happy to go again ive recommended aida to others
we are always impressed by the standard of aida cruises
professional and well organized trip to norway
it was a really nice trip that i can only recommend to everyone
nice short trip for a small budget well organized shore excursions
our last trip was a traveling kindergarten from morning until late at night there were screaming toddlers in all areas of the ship now even in the specialty restaurants otherwise it was as usual with aida a very nice trip
it was simply beautiful life on board was well organized and pleasant
there were some breathtaking landscapes and thanks to the lecturer a lot of impressions and information
a really lovely holiday everything went perfectly it wont be our last trip with aida were already looking forward to the next ship
a really great holiday great service great ports and sights it was a very very nice experience with the aida perla
its great what the aida team does and how great you feel as a guest
great and relaxing holiday
i like the relaxed atmosphere especially on the smaller ships of the sphinx class the buffet restaurants are relatively well laid out and quiet the staff are very friendly and always in a good mood the centrally located theatrium offers many entertainment options aida excursions are expensive however
super relaxing and nice time
a vacation with a cruise is still a dream vacation nevertheless it is noticeable that staff are being cut back which is affecting the service employees are enjoying their work less which is certainly due to the workload and also the management the employees are doing their best despite the pressure and the burden but unfortunately the smiles are disappearing more and more dear aida managers it is long overdue to do something for satisfied employees if the employee is happy the customer is happy too
aida makes your vacation a special experience
it was our first cruise the balcony cabin was very nice and we were lucky with the weather a week of pure sunshine in norwaygreat sunsets everything was very beautiful
it was my first cruise on the aidacosma everything was new i felt comfortable and safe i enjoyed the food and there was a lot to choose from the entertainment was also good i can definitely recommend the cruise ship
we really enjoyed the trip with aidaprima
relaxing holiday with many great offers and experiences
everything was well organized and the aida team made my sisters th birthday a special experience throughout the entire trip
great beautiful route we had great weather always happy to travel with aida
great ship absolutely top service from the crew very nice trip
our holiday was wonderful and we have you to thank for that
my first cruise with the aidanova an experience that i would like to recommend to the rest of the world everyone has different ideas and different tastes thats why its not always easy to give a suitable review for me everything on the trip was perfect from start to finish cleanliness friendly staff and service are top priorities at aida even if some guests dont know how to behave the staff still say goodbye to them with a smile the staffs friendliness alone always puts you in a good mood i will always travel with aida the next one is already being planned with the aidacosma
the best way to travel and get to know different countries and cities aida has a relaxed and easygoing concept compared to its competitors ships of all sizes and routes for every taste
everything was perfect great trip would love to go again
i had a great cruise with aida
it was the first time we traveled with aida cosma the size of the ship is impressive but it makes it difficult to find your way around on the first few days on board we enjoyed the evenings with great shows and cocktails the entire staff apart from one unpleasant rule that had to be enforced by a crew member were very friendly and accommodating we will travel with aida again next year but this time on a smaller ship
a great trip everything was perfect
exploring different corners of the world in perfect surroundings on a great ship is really fun
once again it was a very nice trip great organization excellent food and very friendly staff on board thank you id be happy to go again
always happy to come back it was a great holiday
great trip great ship and great crew well be back
all in all a very nice holiday
ive developed a passion for cruises
you are always taken care of and get help in almost every situation you see the world get impressions and get an education included traveling with a cruise is a great concept
a super nice holiday
great trip you can clearly see the good work of professionals well be back
aida trip too boring and overpriced
we have been traveling with aida for many years and are always very satisfied
we have booked two more aida trips on board nothing more needs to be said
it was fun and it was a great inspiration to visit certain places and cities again
its a good thing to cruise
anyone who knows aida knows what they are getting extremely friendly and courteous staff good food beautiful destinations a great show program all of this at a relatively reasonable price
the concept is really good excursions are well planned but there could be more accompaniment
top vacation
always happy for me there is only aida
thank you aidait was another wonderful trip
a great trip with aida like every one with them everything was great
a really great cruise with the aidaprima with special features such as the extraordinary tour and the port anniversary in hamburg the service and the experience were such that i would book again immediately
this time everything was perfect the weather played along everything was done to create the most wonderful holiday feeling
super nice holiday saw and experienced a lot great food great staff beautiful huge ship
the aida holiday was very nice for us
always happy to travel with aida again
we were really looking forward to an entertaining short vacation finally traveling with aida again the last trips were with tui cruises and we missed the aida moments unfortunately every day of the trip we wished we were back on a ship in the mein schiff fleet the service at the bars was abysmally bad you just had the feeling you were disturbing us and felt like a burden we have always found the staff to be extremely cheerful and courteous but this time it was completely different no smile no pleasethank you what a shame no pool party no laser show no officers hook no farewell party we missed all of that at tui and wanted to go back to aida but there was none of that there either a real shame
it was a great trip the entire team from the captain to the service staff were very friendly helpful and always had a smile on their faces
nice trips and a good priceperformance ratio
aida is pure package low budget tourism
it was a fantastic holiday that we would repeat immediately all the staff are very friendly and always helpful the excursions are perfectly organised the evening shows are top class all around perfect
everything is greatyou go on board and just have a holiday
an unforgettable holiday experience lots of hardworking people doing their best
it was a fantastic trip and a unique experience thanks to the great crew
aida is always fun to travel i recommend it to everyone
we enjoyed the cruise with aida to scotland shetland and norway
the destinations are top the organization is top always worth a vacation
aidacosma mediterranean treasures great ship and despite the many people everything worked great nice staff great food an allround wonderful holiday
i can only recommend a trip with aida its clear that not everything will work out perfectly you also have to do your part to make it a success unfortunately there are constant complainers everywhere i have experience with other providers and am enthusiastic about aida
great trip again and again
it was our first cruise and our expectations were met
super nice relaxing holiday perfect for people with food intolerances
very good firsttime cruising for me i enjoyed every moment i can surely do it again
entire trip
great vacation
a great motivated crew that does its best to offer guests a relaxing holiday and make the most beautiful time of the year unforgettable
it was a great holiday perfectly organized everything was perfect and we felt absolutely comfortable
the whole atmosphere and on this trip above all getting to know nice people who are travelling alone
great trip on aida stella
the cruise was one of my best experiences when i entered the ship i was impressed by its size and beauty every morning i woke up with a new view of the sea or beautiful coasts and participated in different activities and evening shows the food was amazing and the different restaurants with international menus offered a unique experience the crew was very friendly and professional and made the trip very pleasant and comfortable this trip was a combination of rest and adventure and left me with sweet and unforgettable memories it was the third time i traveled with aida and it was just as enjoyable as the first time
a great ship a great crew a fantastic experience that we had with aida we would be happy to go again any time
everything was as described in the travel documents
very nice trip great ship cool entertainment friendly helpful and competent staff very good food
great time with my husband ship food cities everything great
relaxation and spa and entertainment was great
the trip to the norwegian fjords was beautiful the aidaperla was an interesting trip with wellchosen ports the facilities and service were good the only major drawback was the quotsmoking protectionquot on the cabin balconies unfortunately we could not use our balcony nor could we leave the balcony door open as there were chain smokers living in the cabin in front of us unfortunately aida does not allow a free cabin change because of this we had booked a veranda cabin and unfortunately only got an outside cabin cigarette smoke in the cabin is a nogo for us
great trip on a beautiful ship with very nice staff
we were in mediterranean for days with aidacosma incredibly nice experience never expected it everything was perfect and great food in buffet restaurants was great and there was a lot of choice despite the big ship you never had to wait in line nowhere i was worried about this before my trip be sure to try the specialty restaurants french kiss and oceans staff were very competent and super friendly entertainment events especially at theatrium were very professional
a carefree holiday from start to finish
priceperformance ratio at aida is rightrelaxing holiday despite not perfect weather
we had a very nice caribbean vacation with and on the aida luna the only small drawback the quotsigns of wearquot on the ship the circular pool was not filled with water during the entire trip which was a shame because you would have liked to cool your legs on deck and the carpets were showing their age lots of stains in the hallways but otherwise everything was great
everything was very well planned absolutely great and very beautiful
the third aida trip was once again a great unforgettable experience aida cosma is an impressive great ship with everything you could wish for i can only recommend everyone to take a cruise with aida
very interesting trip super
the trip and especially the destinations were good
the aida cosma is a super modern ship that is fun to be on board
it was just a completely fantastic relaxing holiday
relaxing days on board and on land met new nice people enjoyed the cruise
well organized cruise interesting destinations
i cant think of anything i could criticize about aida apart from a few minor things its just a different concept for vacation supervised vacation at its finest i noticed a good working atmosphere among the crew maybe thats down to the captainmanagement in terms of cuisine the cosma sets the bar pretty high entertainment is of a very high standard for me
i have been travelling with aida since and i have always enjoyed it you see and learn a lot and dont always have to pack and unpack your suitcase my next trip is already planned the crew and the service staff are friendly and helpful
had a great holiday again with aida
all age groups are welcome on aida and can feel comfortable and relax
great time would love to go back incredibly friendly staff all very meticulous in their work and still time for fun if you really want to experience relaxation and luxury you cant go wrong here
it was just nice to be on board again great relaxation and a great feeling on board the aida cosma
when you go on board you immediately feel like you are on holiday and i would like it that way too a really great team on the ship thank you aida
a wonderful breathtaking holiday all the buffets and restaurants were fantastic all the staff on the aida were friendly and helpful you had a lot of fun the shore excursion was amazing the evening program was amazing something new every day
seeing the world from aboard an aida ship is magical
it was a really lovely trip with the aidanova from the start of the trip to the last day everything was perfectly organised from the organisation of the onboard excursions to the service on board everything was perfect the entertainment was great and the food was absolutely top notch
this was our very first cruise we set off on the trip full of expectations our expectations were far exceeded it was simply great and very varied a cruise travels to many international cities and countries in a very short space of time and the hotel the ship is always there this is unique and in our opinion cannot be achieved in a comparable way through your own individual trips as everything has to be organized by yourself the entertainment on board and the variety of restaurants offer a variety of options for young and old our summary this was our first cruise and we will also spend our next vacation on the ship there are still many routes and cities to explore
there is no quotbetterquot way for families to travel relaxed out into the wide world and feeling at home every time you step on the ship eating in this abundance in the morning at lunchtime and in the evening is a challenge but also a pleasure thank you very much for this great time
it was a very nice trip
traveling with aida is always an exciting and thrilling experience there is always something new to discover on every trip whether on the ship or on land
it was just very nice because it was my first time on board the aida
great holiday with lots of new acquaintances
a great trip with great service
very good overall package with excursions and port destinations
festival tour was awesome everything was friendly and very peaceful
my trip was very nice
it was our first festival experience and it was really fun
it was a great trip delicious food good service nice people and great atmosphere
the aida cosma is simply amazing it is worth going on a cruise with this ship
another wonderful trip this time with lots of music on board
super short trip for days
we went on a mediterranean cruise with the aida cosma and our expectations were more than exceeded in every area this was not our last tour with the aida cosma
best vacation
it wasnt my first aida cruise but it will be my last as i was already annoyed by the crowds in the buffet restaurants the first few times this time i dug deep into my pockets and booked an allinclusive package in the hope of being able to sit in peace in one of the quotspecialtyquot restaurants and enjoy a nice glass of white wine but that was far from the case on the quotnovaquot there was no possibility of getting a reservation on any evening and spontaneous arrival was not successful i wasted hundreds of euros on a drinks package for the total price i could have gone on quotmein schiffquot
we havent yet traveled with aida but the trip we booked is already costing us too much stress in advance the app is terrible confusing incomplete instead of fairly pointing out that its best to do everything on your laptop before you start your trip you are thrown into this black hole app overall this is not a good experience for a cruise newbie there are far too many things to do in advance with far too many deadlines and the app is anything but helpful on the contrary it even hinders you from keeping track of everything i expect things to be completely different in these digital times for me thats already a reason why i dont want to put myself through this again when i book a family trip i usually just feel anticipation afterwards unfortunately that is absolutely not the case here
always aida drop off your bags and go on holiday
our trip with aida was really great
it was the best holiday of my life
a surprisingly pleasant experience as a firsttime aida traveler i was particularly impressed by the high level of all the services offered
if you want to feel like part of a community and are interested and open to other nations this is the right place for you it was wonderful once again to experience the aida feeling to eat well to unwind to get to know new cities apart from a few minor details it was perfect
great trip in norway very beautiful landscapes and beautiful experiences
it was a wonderful trip to scotland shetland islands and norway highly recommended
mostly positive experiences since i have traveled with aida about times
fantastically beautiful always happy to come back
great crew all wishes are fulfilled its always fun to travel with aida
a lovely holiday with friendly people and very good service
the trip fully met our expectations
we felt very comfortable it was a very nice vacation
an allround successful holiday anytime again the guest is there fantastic service from morning to evening there was not a single boring minute on the day at sea you could relax well and do lots of things
maybe aida will change their policy about their guests or do they see people as guests
great trip great food great excursions excellent entertainment perfect service
i am very satisfied with my trip with aidacosma
to collect positive impressions at many different destinations within a relatively short period of time
aida nova junior suite cabin the cabin is directly above the brewery unbearable noise at lunchtime and in the evening until pm we were offered a replacement sleeping cabin for the nights quotluxury that we didnt expect in a suitequot the small balcony with space for chairs no roof you get wet when it rains no sliding door no loungers frosted glass wall with a restricted view the actual living space is quite small for a junior suite it is far back and is always dark after cruises with aida royal caribbean costa cunard msc holland america celebrity this aida junior suite has been our biggest disappointment to date
everything is perfectly coordinated and leaves nothing to be desired if thats what you want everything is as described in the travel documents and advertisements simply great
it was an allround good trip that will be remembered
it was a great trip and the service on board was great
everything was great and a great experience
pure dream vacation
i was very skeptical and very scared because i didnt know if i would be able to cope with the ship my fears were unfounded i have never had such a great vacation as on board the aidablu you have to experience it yourself to understand what i mean
nice holiday
the whole thing was absolutely perfect it was a pleasure to travel with the aidacosma the trip took us from tenerife to barcelona simply beautiful im already looking forward to the next trip
aida is always worth a trip
the aida ships are actually really pleasant cruise ships especially the sphinx class but the way aida treats nonsmokers these days is unacceptable smoking is permitted in most outdoor areas balconies are also outdoor areas which means that cigarette smoke wafts almost everywhere on the ship sometimes even into the buffet restaurants great for smokers but for us for example this meant that we were never able to use our balcony on our trip because cigarette smoke was always blowing onto the balcony and into the room from somewhere
had a very pleasant time on the aida stella i definitely want to go again thank you for the great experience
aida impressed me to my complete satisfaction
to give passengers a wonderful holiday feeling
once again it was a great pleasure to travel with the entire aida staff the employees are always in a good mood nice and friendly always with a smile on their faces
it was another great experience on the aida
great cruises for everyone with very good value for money good food friendly and helpful staff at all times and very good entertainment
the trip on the aida cosma was very nice the only drawback is the restaurants with their peak times with small children you usually go to eat earlier unfortunately everything is fullovercrowded the best place for children to go is fuego there is plenty of choice the adults can then go to the respective restaurants in the evening its all a matter of interpretation for parents with children the baby monitor service is really praiseworthy it worked really well and the reception was good all over the ship you just have to be near a wifi hotspot
everything was perfect the holiday was a total success
we were looking for relaxation in the spa area and found it but the days at sea were very full so it would be nice if places were also reserved for people who have a weeks flat rate
great moments beautiful ship and especially always friendly goodhumored and constantly smiling staff
always happy to come back great holidays whether with friends or family
was a very nice cruise on a beautiful clean ship
again a very high quality cruise with many highlights
world tour the trip itself was a dream the entertainment program was excellent because the crew were all really committed unfortunately the excursions were disproportionately expensive one had the impression that aida was getting back the money it lost during the corona period furthermore our excursion to rarotonga was simply changedrebooked without consulting us aida refused to refund the excursion price only received a credit and quotonlyquot offered vouchers for another trip with aida clear violation of german law mutual declaration of intent in the contract the golf trip to fiji was also completely overpriced at euros green fee including cart was usd if you are aware that everything really everything costs extra with aida and that in an emergency you have to go to court to enforce your rights you can book a trip with aida
the trip was worth it aida is really impressive i think i would book again
it was a wonderful short trip with the family everyone enjoyed it very much
an allround successful cruise with many great experiences great service and a super route
aida organized a very good trip all around
very nice travel destinations good for gaining first experiences at sea
very varied holiday there is something for every taste in music entertainment food drink travel and excursions
day adriatic cruise from corfu on aidablu a very interesting route on a not too big ship very good service nice selection of high quality food and drink varied entertainment a week of successful vacation
very nice ship great staff very nice destinations everything was perfect
was a very nice holiday and we are looking forward to seeing aida
its just fun to travel the world with aida you see so much and everything on the ship is always tiptop
double trip baltic sea sweden denmark days great holiday anytime again next trip is with aida to the mediterranean
always a good alternative to the normal beach holiday
the ship is fine for a week but for longer trips it would be too big for me
of course there are always little things that you could complain about but youre on vacation and you should just go through life calmly this was my th aida trip and not the last
i like traveling with aida and the advice from mrs winter at aida in rostock is very important and simply warm and very good
a nice trip with great activities good food and a friendly crew
this was the first cruise ive reviewed here and i had a lot of fun the crew the closeness of the officers and the officers interest in the guests you could tell that everyone on this ship has a passion for working with people as their top priority the evening events were great and varied one evening x rock and the other evening x abba the entertainment manager went to great lengths to entertain us guests and he really succeeded even when an abba show had to be cancelled due to local problems with the radio network a replacement was quickly arranged and it was explained straight away what the problem was and that everything was being done to work on a solution all in all thank you for this wonderful week and i will always keep it in my thoughts see you on aida
nice trip with beautiful cities and met nice people
the journey of experiences
despite the size of the ship aida nova everything was just great
the ease of travel
nice trip with friends
always great to discover the world with aida top buffet restaurants and varied entertainment very friendly serviceoriented staff
aida is like coming home you always meet a great team and nice people
the trip was an experience and will remain in our memories thanks to the crew of the aida cosma
the experiences of our trip will remain in our positive memories we will gladly pass on our impressions to our friends acquaintances and relatives
aida trip from grand canaria to palma everything was great and a lot of effort was made all the crew were very friendly recommended
aida cosma is a very large but also a very beautiful ship it was our second trip and it will not be our last perhaps with another aida ship you have to get to know the differences
this is simply vacation
we were very satisfied with the aida cruise the ship aida perla was very beautiful
the open and relaxed atmosphere on board the fun and togetherness
good travel atmosphere
my th trip with aida will also be my last quantity instead of quality seems to be the new slogan of the kissmouth fleet and to top it all off the suitcases will stay in barcelona
it was our th trip with aida all in all it was a very nice vacation with lots of great experiences being in a different city every day is great everyone definitely gets their moneys worth the only thing to mention is that the aida excursions have become very expensive so its worth finding out beforehand what you can do on your own in the city
a great short trip to northern europe
aida is a cruise family we really liked the solidarity friendliness and helpfulness of the employees
it was a new experience to travel on an aida cruise ship i am very satisfied with this trip
the arrival and departure was great
very beautiful route with many impressive moments
another wonderful tour with the aida
good vacation everything was great thank you very much it was the first time we hope its not the last excellent food delicious drinks cleanliness everywhere sensory opening of doors in the toilets is a great idea shows and discos swimming pool and jacuzzi minigolf everything to make your vacation not boring and comfortable
a holiday to feel good
our th aida trip went with aidasol to scotland and norway the trip was wonderful the trip through the sognefjord was fantastic aida also made it possible for us to go to the aquarium in lesund first thing in the morning where i immediately went to the outside area and had my favorite animal the sea otter and the seals to myself for about minutes unfortunately the ship suffered greatly from the cold wet weather rust spots in the sailing areas we were last on the sol in and were somewhat disappointed with the condition of the ship
it was a super nice trip and the price was also very good
another wonderful select trip this time on the aidasol from april th to may st the fjords are always great we felt very comfortable we had a balcony cabin on deck it was our th trip with aida
everything was perfect always happy to go on holiday with aida
it was the first cruise and definitely not the last it was great and full of special impressions delicious food and a beautiful atmosphere
we were very welcome as a family group of people and the birthday was fantastically organized by the crew
great destinations great ships excellent friendly staff
i really enjoyed the trip ill definitely do more
you feel comfortable and welcome in the aida family from the first moment
my first cruise id love to go again
it was a successful eventful trip with the aidablu we got to know many interesting cities
it was my first themed trip i am not a fan of the theatrium my aversion was confirmed again
we found the trip with the aida cosma wonderful and would repeat it again
aida perla has a great crew who pass on their good mood and joy in their job to the guests
an allround successful holiday the crew does everything to satisfy the guests the shows are worldclass
fjords were great
the norway cruise with the aidanova only the unstable internet connection spoiled the holiday fun from time to time
the moin cruise was quite extraordinary with guest stars on board including otto the shanty choir was very special the food was maritime the crew gave it their all it was a great trip which i hadnt expected thank you very much
i was completely happy and satisfied had a great rest and the food was delicious i was also able to discover lots of new places to visit the entertainment program was great and the service was excellent
a great trip with special entertainment great
aida created an atmosphere that immediately captivated you a smile and a friendly hello were always present from every crew member fantastic entertainment and excellent food round off the positive overall impression
very nice tour with great acts compliments also to the bar service who always fought through despite the full theatrium
i feel like im in good hands from the first to the last second of the cruise the onboard activities such as entertainment sports wellness and relaxation offer a range of options that mean youll never be bored on days at sea the excursions also offer a variety of options where youll always find something interesting the service staff are always friendly attentive and helpful
a great trip on a great ship despite the size of the ship you always find a place
the warmth among the crew the smiles the appreciation among each other everyone helps each other that is reflected in us holidaymakers
it was a great trip with a great ship and great destinations very friendly and helpful staff in all areas
the complete trip with the aidadiva
it was my first cruise ever i was immediately welcomed and felt very comfortable
this trip was fine
aida vacation means a very good priceperformance ratio we really enjoyed our th trip even though it was only a short trip days we are delighted with the organization from arrival to departure everything was top
met nice fellow travelers
i was very happy with the trip on the aida diva i will definitely do it again
aida has taken me across many many oceans and i dont regret a single moment for me there is always something to see on aida
everything was ok on the aida
the holiday exceeded our expectations the warmth on board is infectious and you feel very much part of the family
the aida company provides excellent planning and execution services for its guests
it is absolutely impossible that mallorca is advertised as a destination and we boarded the aida at pm and were taken back to the airport at am when we left while other guests were already on the stella at am on the day of arrival or didnt have their return flight until pm my friends and family who are traveling with us as well as i feel cheated out of a days vacation the rest of our trip was fantastic its a great ship the staff are very helpful and friendly its clean the food is great
great trip great value for money a big thank you to the aida family
an experience of freedom and adventure pure luxury staff food ship excursions and the onsite program make you want more when i got home i was overcome by a longing and melancholy that felt like heartbreak the team and the ship aida are addictive
courtesy competence helpfulness of the crew very well organized good food very interesting excursions cleanliness and hygiene on deck excellent i also had a very good experience with aida customer service before the trip by email and by phone
we have had many great experiences with aida we have been very happy with the ships and crew so far and are already looking forward to the next trip
we had fun on the aida stella trip
my first trip was a very nice experience basically i would always prefer a balcony cabin i found the priceperformance ratio a bit too expensive of course you cant compare a cruise with an allinclusive hotel in egypt for example aida well be back
carefree eventful holiday from start to finish simply great
great ship great wonderful moments great service in all areas wonderful
great trip in terms of the route the service and the restaurants however the ship is too full there is a crowd at every corner aida yes but not with the cosma
th trip everything was great
everything was great we are looking forward to the next trips
great ship good berths great excursions good food friendly staff very clean excursions well organized all in all a successful family vacation anytime again
we were very satisfied with the trip overall and the promises of the travel offer were kept unfortunately the weather was not so good during the weeks but aida cant change that
great trip under great conditions beautiful spacious ship with lots of options food and drinks were delicious varied and of very high quality the trip offered us everything we wanted in the overall package so full marks
it was a fantastic experience with aida nova very friendly staff and there was so much to do on board everything was kept very well and neatly clean food and drink was perfect and the bars and restaurants were spic and span we will certainly do this more often with aida all in all our first cruise went beyond expectations
i have been travelling with aida for decades a lot has changed and a lot for the better i have often heard that the large ships are not well received by frequent travellers which should give you something to think about
nice trip with a not so nice excursion
great vacation
a vacation on the aida diva is like being at home only with new views every day
great holiday
a dreamy trip worth seeing you can always complain at a high level but its all human i was allowed to celebrate my birthday with the diva and sail out of warnemnde the surroundings make it
every age has different expectations of their vacation for people over the weather food relaxation socializing entertainment and nice accommodation are certainly more important than discos and pool fun and you can find all of that on the ship
our sixth trip with aida perfect service with arrival and departure packages for us interesting destinations in the adriatic the mediterranean the canary islands and the caribbean the relaxed interaction between staff and guests on board is particularly important to us food and drink are provided in the many bars and restaurants in the usual aida quality
it was nice to experience a new and modern ship
great holiday feeling thanks to friendly staff great service great food great shows and entertainment always happy to come back
the trip was a great experience for us
we use a cruise to travel the world for as long as possible while taking into account our health possibilities
aida is not for belgian passengers as already indicated language german you will receive an email response sorry we do not understand you our correspondence is only german also on board some try some english or something interesting food the same every day some choice events only yes german as dutch speaking passengers you have quite a difficult time excursions terribly expensive and the guides only speak if i ever want to book another cruise it certainly wont be with aida the text you read above is written in dutch i notice that this translation is also not correct
great holiday aida always nice
this was my th trip with aida and i think it was great
the ship aida cosma is too big for me personally
we had a great holiday all around on the canary islands madeira trip we would also like to do this tour at some point but then on a smaller ship the cosma is too big for us and there are too many people eating in the restaurants is a bit of a conscience and the background noise is very loud even at the lanai bar that was much more pleasant on the prima and bella
days on the perla from barbados to tenerife as an alternative to the cancelledcancelled bella tour from dubai to mallorca im not a fan of the caribbean but i was looking for something alternative that lasts longer than a week and where its warm this tour was a good choice especially since you can relax really well on six days at sea unfortunately i was unlucky with my cabin this time however an attempt was made on board to remedy my problem even if it didnt work its commendable that they tried it was a wonderful days with mostly great weather and nice people the condition in some corners of the perla was surprisingly bad i was very surprised and ive never experienced anything like that on aida before hopefully theyll improve things here but you can overlook that if the rest is right and it was the crew gave it their all as always and thats what makes traveling with aida so special its amazing a very special thank you goes to the ships doctor and her team in the autumn we will be returning to the prima
very nice holiday for people with disabilities traveling on smaller aida ships is even nicer
as always an interesting trip with great experiences and nice people
everything the entire crew the excursions keep it up
it was another vacation that couldnt have been better
sensationally beautiful transvoyage from tenerife via madeira porto a corua and le gavre to hamburg great ports and excursions the perla is a super ship with great offers and the service is allround good and makes you feel good
an unforgettable trip with great moments
it was simply beautiful i would love to come again
it was a little adventure id love to do it again
traveling with aida is relaxed exciting and interesting the offers are varied and very well organized
looking forward to the next trip it is always an experience
allround carefree package perfect trip on board the aidamar
we really enjoyed it and felt very comfortable it was a great trip
the first cruise was like a miracle for us we have never felt so good and satisfied physically and mentally after a vacation trip with many unforgettable impressions and memories
the whole tour
it was always a nice experience to travel with aida aida has great crew on their ships
we really liked the perla the aida tours are good and fun but the days in port that we planned ourselves were also nice in retrospect i would use the a la carte restaurants more often as it is much quieter there
this was our th trip with aida booked tours that once fell victim to corona mira cape town which unfortunately fell victim to cv the nd trip adria from corfu which was cancelled due to operation was canceled for me
it was a great trip
the trip with the aidasol was a great experience the excursions were very well organized
just the really nice people who served us or dreamed up our cabin make it worth taking another trip with aida
an aida trip is pure vacation from a to z
everything was perfect from checking in to information and the friendliness of the crew
itinerary was great
overall the trip was very good
very good organization and comprehensive information regarding the trip
this trip also included a number of very beautiful destinations the service staff were extremely friendly and competent and the weather was perfect too
nice short trip
we would be happy to travel with aida cruises again the best guest care very good entertainment friendly and competent crew members and impeccable service we like to use the large selection of excursions on offer the priceperformance ratio is right on aidasehen
the trips with aida have always been the best that i have ever had in my life
it is always nice with the aida the staff and the crew are great
a wellorganized holiday from the start
its easy to get on and off the ship i think the dance classes are really good
a perfect wellorganized trip is guaranteed
for the time i was on board it was a very successful trip except for my illness where i was well looked after
very nice holiday
a great first cruise
the service on board the aida ships is always good the itineraries are always well selected and interesting
a beautiful trip well organized and something for everyone
aida does everything to make you happy personally i think its too crowded and too big thats complaining at a high level
it was a wonderful aida vacation with fantastic moments i would repeat this vacation anytime we were able to relax wonderfully and recharge our batteries
great trip great and friendly service
a fantastic crew awaits you on the aidastella the food and drinks were simply great simply a wonderful holiday
cruise in good weather great in stormy seas better not seasickness
it is the overall package that inspires us you feel like part of the aida family
as a solo traveller on your first cruise its pure adventure
had too little time for real local exploration during the cruise a pity
nice holiday time everything was great gladly again
it was the itinerary that made me decide to travel with aida weeks from shanghai to dubai up until now i was happy with aida this time there were a few negative points
it was a wonderful holiday with everything that goes with it many thanks to eric from the alpine hut and alexa from the spa area
it was a great family trip
i can only recommend aida it was a fantastic trip and everything went well from start to finish
beautiful and relaxing sea voyage with great experiences and people
iceland is something you have to see at least once and in combination with the northern lights it is simply a dream
the trips could be cheaper more entertainment instead of everything on tv
unfortunately the aida team let us down in dubai on the day of departure on april the company had already known early in the morning that there were no return flights from dubai we were still taken to dubai airport and then there was chaos at dubai airport the return journey then went to frankfurt instead of zurich fortunately we arrived home after a delay of over hours unfortunately without luggage highquality suitcases with travel luggage this will cost aida a lot of money and we have had a debit of charged back we will definitely not take another cruise with aida there are better cruise companies
i have already been on many cruises with aida and have never been really disappointed there have been highs and lows overall i have always left the ship refreshed and in a good mood and had a wonderful time as was the case recently in the canaries you should perhaps think a little about the type of travel and it is not suitable for everyone large ships in particular have advantages for some but may not be suitable for others the organization on my current trip was again excellent and i saw a lot on land individually and with a prebooked excursion at peak times the buffet restaurants are full especially on sea days you cannot get a lounger quotswimmingquot in the pool is almost impossible as a frequent traveler you know the shows everything is fine i canmust come to terms with this and set other priorities and enjoy the time on board and on land i will continue to travel with aida in the future as long as the routes interest me
this will be my first cruise with aida i have previously been on other cruise ships the aidacosma exceeded my expectations
aida nova is a mighty ship with an incredible number of options for planning your vacation there is hardly anything left to be desired reserving sun loungers is not a problem for aida thats just us narrowminded germans its a shame but its a known problem
a dream trip that completely exceeded our expectations
i can highly recommend aida cruises the service is topnotch the excursions offered are very good i can highly recommend the entire service area and the food on the aida
aida is always beautiful the atmosphere the staff just everything
the trip was a complete success very well organized very friendly helpful and very wellinformed crew everything was clean and tidy
aida family holiday point out finished out of points
we were on the metropolis tour with the nova from april th to april th it was a great experience great crew always friendly great captain who explained everything we met great people
it wasnt the first time we travelled with aida which is why we gave it five stars and have always been very satisfied
it was my first cruise and not the last the organization was top notch
the second part of the trip with the destinations in the adriatic was new for us and a very good experience
it was our first cruise and we are very impressed the organization the logistics the friendliness of the staff it was perfect all around as soon as we got on the ship we started to feel like we were on vacation we were able to forget everything and just enjoy ourselves there is something for everyone you can party and have lots of people around you and at the same time find and enjoy quiet corners on the ship wellness is absolutely recommended we will definitely be back
vacation as we define it
everything was very nice very friendly and well organized
asia trip with strong highlights and sensational impressions of the big capitals on the tour great impressions and insights into asian culture
arrival transfer stay and departure were very well organized the aidacosma is a beautiful ship with many attractions and very good food
we spent days on aida bella from shanghai via japan to dubai it was a dream even after the th trip the food balcony cabin service in all areas entertainment and crowd were simply great despite it being the holiday season there werent too many children but they were well behaved compliments to the parents simply beautiful that makes traveling fun for everyone the many albeit expensive excursions were all worth the money this trip was simply perfect for us even though the bella was fully booked
cruise ok
we are about to go on the festival cruise with the aida prima unfortunately aida is not sticking to its own catalog descriptions at the time the trip was booked it was clearly stated that the aida light drinks package can be booked on every cruise from day i have screenshots of this too now aida says this will not be available and is quickly changing its terms and conditions we no longer receive any response to email inquiries but it can still be booked for children although their new description shouldnt really say this anymore either very difficult behavior from aida the drinks package was even advertised in the anticipation email there is no question that the festival will still be great but aida doesnt seem to believe in principles lots of people are also getting lots of different statements from aida thank goodness there are other great shipping companies nd aida trip and again things are going differently than hoped
from arrival to departure everything was good the employees were very friendly and helpful with everything we definitely recommend a cruise with aida
a wonderful experience with many great moments and memories
allround carefree simply vacation
aida is always worth a trip great thank you very much
the lively atmosphere on the ship is always nice for me i have to but i can join in
best holiday ever
pleasant trip everything was very well organized arrival departure excursions many nice crew members and tour guides lots of variety great varied food you get a great holiday feeling
our short trip was the first quotcruisequot for us we just wanted to try it out the aida more than surprised us with the service staff excursions and offers on board our expectations were exceeded it was worth it
great trip
thank you very much it was very impressive we will come back to see aida
i felt more refreshed on the short trip than i usually do after at least twice as long battery recharged quickly great
fantastic transocean voyage aida perla is a great ship with lots of options for all age groups the crew is incredibly attentive and hardworking the different restaurants offer an incredible variety of options even though it was fully booked we always got free loungers on the pool deck thanks to the towel cards and security the new aida show heart of the ocean was gigantic lots of guest artists and parties it was never boring even on days at sea in a row quite the opposite wed love to come back
just switch off just vacation
aida is perfect for cruises
the trip was extremely well organized and the service was always perfect super friendly nothing was missing thank you hopefully well be back anytime
great tour operator great experiences and incredible service
i am happy to be a guest on the aida
great holiday
great travel locations ports very friendly crew great service
wonderful trip would love to go again
aida stands for a very good range of destinations and an extensive pampering program the people are friendly and courteous always smiling and always try to fulfill all wishes
the route in northern norway was simply fantastic perfect weather beautiful route northern lights
great trip with great people and excursions
we had a very nice time on the aida
it was my first cruise and my expectations were met i would definitely go again
mega crew great atmosphere awesome food and an extremely great holiday feeling
a wonderful and relaxing canary islands tour with the aidacosma as always there were a lot of guests on the ship despite this everything was well distributed so that there was always a place to sit dining area and pool area the new adult area on the pool deck of the aidacosma is particularly noteworthy aidas travel offers are a bit expensive just rent a car yourself and explore the islands on your own tip reserve a car in advance
great country mostly good weather
everyone should take an aida trip and just enjoy the time
quotyoure on holidayquot is how the perfect holiday always starts for me of course things always go wrong and we certainly dont look at things through rosetinted glasses but even after everything that happens its still the best holiday for us
great vacation on the ship sightseeing at the ports and cities to explore new vacation areas
it was a lovely holiday no problems on board and on the excursions good and very friendly staff lots of entertainment and variety on board will book again
a wonderful trip with lots of new impressions very friendly courteous and always nice staff who carried out the tasks assigned to them with dedication and enthusiasm no matter where you were from no matter which area of the aidastella you felt very comfortable and well looked after by the staff
i really enjoyed the entire vacation trip
it was a wonderful trip i can only recommend it
it was our first cruise and it was a dream and exceeded all expectations new trip with aida is booked
aida nova great ship great crew friendly competent helpful everything perfectly organized and completely stressfree good mix of experiencing new things and developing habits of pure relaxation and entertainment of city and nature everything just the way you want it
the trip was once again unforgettable aida ensures perfect holiday moments and a smile the staff is always friendly and courteous
it was a great short trip with friends
unforgettable trip super friendly and helpful staff on board as well as very well thought out and planned excursions on land and events at sea we will be back
it was a very nice trip and a super nice crew on the ship and they made an effort to make everyone feel comfortable and the hygiene planning on board was great
simply vacation
a cruise to the caribbean without flying
aida vacation has always met my expectations
days in norway from hamburg with the aidanova were fantastic everything was perfect
top shipping company for me the trip was incredibly beautiful with a very good priceperformance ratio
they were beautiful days on the ship as well as on land
what we love about aida trips is that you can experience so much in a short time you get to know the country and its people and you always have your home with you
the s cruises will still take place with aida after which it will be one of the numerous coproviders
aida is simply very professional when it comes to organizing cruises
i really enjoyed everything im looking forward to going on another cruise with you in weeks
it was simply a great trip with a fantastic ship and a fantastic crew
it was a very nice trip with top staff in all areas thank you very much to everyone
aida is highly recommended everything worked out the crew was just great and always had a smile on their faces we will definitely travel with aida again
all in all aida was and is always worth a trip friendly staff sensational food beautiful destinations and a great atmosphere on board
it was simply brilliant to be travelling with aida again
the trip was an allround successful holiday great ports great excursion offers and last but not least a crew that makes the guest feel welcome
aida made every effort to satisfy the guests
a dream vacation everything was superbly organized from start to finish the crew members were all very nice and friendly the food was delicious and plentiful the events were varied and professional the dance lessons offered were very well attended by young and old all in all it was a great vacation on the aida stella
great route good conversations and excursions
a very nice quiet trip on the aida cosma
it was another really great holiday thank you very much for a great time
super nice holiday thank you aida for the happy moments
overall it was a relaxing eventful trip the aida team always made sure that you felt comfortable and looked after
the winter break offered by aida from february th to april th was just right the farewell was pure emotion thank you
aida is like coming home to the family
i like to travel with the aida every time no matter which
the trip was beautiful as were the moments on the aida
great holiday just good
nice trip the ship is unfortunately showing its age but it was clean and tidy after the renovation in i would definitely go again
a great trip with culinary highlights
the trip was very nice and eventful we can highly recommend this trip
a wonderful holiday thanks to excellent service
it was a wonderful time with new impressions and experiences
in general there is nothing bad to say about an aida trip we traveled on the aida cosma between the canaries and madeira the ship has a lot to offer and we certainly didnt see and do everything the days were almost too short for that the quality is generally very high both in terms of the facilities and the food and drinks however i noticed two really negative points that shouldnt be there on an expensive trip point since we have a yearold daughter we obviously had to travel during the holiday season so we were on a packed ship with around guests of which at least were children we had expected that so it was no surprise to us unfortunately aida decided to introduce a person area which meant that only one outdoor pool was available for the approximately children this was of course where the hustle and bustle was the greatest with no sign of relaxation the water quality of the pool was probably extremely poor due to this decision you could really only describe it as brackish water i went in there once for a short time because i wanted to cool off but i was so disgusted that i didnt want to go in again and that despite what felt like c outside i then took a look at the pool in the person area and tested it out crystal clear and cool water with a very relaxed atmosphere you could say that the infinity pool had greenbrown water probably because the filter performance was not sufficient there it also never smelled of chlorine which is very unusual because when urine sweat or skin particles get into the water the chlorine is released and you can smell it clearly like almost all children my daughter was wearing diving goggles and reported that there was probably faeces on the bottom another person reported that the pool had already been closed a few days earlier because faeces had to be removed from there too i have a pool at home that is m deep you can see your toes at any time keeping a pool clean is definitely not easy with so many people but as an organizer of luxury trips i should be able to do it point the aida cosma is the flagship of the fleet in the truest sense of the word you want to present quality here and make people want more unfortunately there were disappointments here too the ship already has a backlog of maintenance in many places the problems were particularly severe in the fun park and the game center i would get everything in shape for the easter or summer holidays but aida seems to think differently there is a kind of reaction wall in the fun park but unfortunately it was out of order there were also elements missing from the wall so it looked bad then there is a small obstacle course for the children there should actually be a buzzer at the start with which you can start the time this was also missing and there were only cables hanging from the column in the game center most of the machines were out of order but we already knew that from the luna apparently this area is treated very poorly in general you can see that the ship is used a lot i can hardly tell the difference between the luna and the cosma even though there are many years between them of course i only mean the wear and tear not the design or the equipment so in conclusion an aida trip is always nice but could be nicer if it didnt have the minor defects or ugliness mentioned we were guests during the easter holidays which as expected meant that it was always full and loud everywhere it starts with waiting forever for the elevators and ends with all the loungers on the pool deck being taken here i would like the guests to abandon their quotgerman mentalityquot of reserving and for the aida crew to really keep the loungers free because of the loungers with a towel on them were not used all day not to mention that beach chairs shells or nicer seating areas are reserved early in the morning for the whole day towel in book on it and after me the deluge but thats probably more of a cultural problem than one of aida
i had a lovely cruise with the aida nova i was able to gain new experiences and plan my vacation differently i can only recommend the aida because i will be back
aidaprima is a wonderful ship service route cabins technology as well as food and drinks were as usual always perfect
aida gave us a great trip from hamburg to the caribbean and back friendly staff made this trip a lasting experience
an aida trip is always nice usually everything works out
the cruise with the aida cosma was very harmonious excursions variety on the ship in terms of food great options for my children and grandchildren
was a very nice trip
we are completely satisfied and look forward to the next trip
always happy to go again well organized and still enough time for individual moments dubai amp co with aida a very interesting and very good recommendation
it was our first trip on the aida and we went on a tour to the far north we had nothing but beautiful weather and experienced all the wonders of nature whether it was the northern lights or whales we saw it all
aida is an outstanding cruise operator that i have booked twice for my trips the experiences so far have been outstanding
a great allround carefree package on a child and familyfriendly luxury steamer the aida perla which gave us a wonderful break with wonderful shore excursions
wellorganized trips for family and friends
i feel very comfortable on aida ships
all in all a successful holiday
the dubai trip was lovely and definitely worth recommending thanks to aida
nice trip with the aida prima in the orient
everything was great we went to the north cape with aida sol the weather was fantastic every day and it was nice to talk to the crew and people on board and get to know the world
for me aida is a club ship with a very high relaxation value
in years with aida cruises a break is always a highlight the weather on the adriatic at easter was better than at home neither too cold nor too warm cities not yet too crowded good food friendly staff very good shows only as a cruiser can you experience so many destinations and impressions in such a short time that the time you experience seems to be longer for me nothing is more boring than a week beach holiday camping with selfdriving cooking and cleaning is also like being at home just somewhere else and your wallet is empty every day i dont need any money on an aida holiday everything is debited from my account but it is a prerequisite that you can handle money and have your spending in mind otherwise you risk a rude awakening when you look at your overdraft after the holiday
once again a great cruise with aida definitely on aidasee
great as always finally traveled with aida again even if only for a short trip havent been on board since corona but before that we were many times and its still a vacation thank you
aida cosma is a mustexperience it is the newest aida ship there is nothing you cant do to spend a wonderful holiday on board i can only recommend it it is a highlight just to experience and enjoy the ship had a wonderful time here i would go back any time
aida cruisers very good services quite professional attentive too bad the aida excursions were in english we preferred to take the excursions of the second week outside to choose german or french
we enjoyed the trip but there were a few minor things missing
it was our first cruise and we set off for the orient with mixed feelings any doubts we had were quickly dispelled big praise to the aida team super organization staff cleanliness service experiences food drink wellness everything to make you feel good we came home with many impressive experiences this will not be our last cruise thank you to the aida team
our norway trip to the north cape from march rd to april th was unique and fantastic we had pure winter with insane amounts of snow but also wonderful sunshine and very little sea swell we were accompanied by dolphins and whales we crossed the arctic circle and were extremely lucky to see fantastic northern lights several times the cuddle tour to the huskies was also great but we skipped the sleigh ride the dogs are so super socialized and friendly and grateful for petting we felt very comfortable on aidasol and especially in cabin the cabin is close to the front staircase the elevators and the restaurants nevertheless it is very quiet great evening program every day i can recommend this trip
very nice trip with great highlights unfortunately for our age we traveled during the holidays which means a lot of children the next cruise is again with aida and again to north cape outside of the holidays if you are looking for nice travel destinations you will find them on aida cruises
it was once again a really nice trip id love to do it again
great cruise an experience unfortunately there are also a lot of inconsiderate people the ravages of time apparently
we had already booked the tour last year and were very satisfied
for my first cruise the impression was simply overwhelming everything was uncomplicated and easy to do so you quickly feel like youve arrived stepping into the balcony cabin for the first time and seeing the view out the front was breathtaking you could spend the days relaxing as you wanted whether booking an excursion or just walking through the cities on the sea days there was a good selection of activities so far i cant think of anything seriously bad you just have to be quick and ideally reserve restaurants weeks before your vacation the only small problems for me were that it felt like the food in the buffet restaurants was only lukewarm but it wasnt bad food just cold and the service at the bars was disorganized you didnt know who to order from and sometimes you had to wait longer a proper system would perhaps be appropriate there otherwise simply a dream trip
very beautiful lake region of the canary islands with madeira fuerteventura tenerife lanzarote and gran ganaria
a beautiful trip with many stops that were far too short to see everything but still lots of impressions for future trips
its always nice to travel with aida although we went on a smaller ship the first time and have decided to only travel on the larger ones from now on they are better for our needs
very satisfied nice trip
captain nikos nitschal is great sea day march th shortened amp additional day on madera made possible thank you very much
a very nice trip with minor restrictions the route is great but also very strenuous
a really great trip with the aidasol highly recommended for winter in the far north
a wonderful holiday in which everything was superbly organised every detail on the ship was thought through and the facilities service and quality of the gastronomy were unique
the friendliness of the entire crew the service in the restaurants and bars we visited we have been on several cruise ships but we enjoyed this trip the best
nice cruise on the aidacosma lots of things were good aidanova was better they are the same design but nova was better for example why can only people over use the front pool whats the point of the nudist area youre looking for a lounger and cant go to the pool with the kids aida is welcome to organize a nudist swinger trip but otherwise all pools should be for children
dreamlike journey
great trip and relaxation almost nothing was missing
absolute holiday feeling a different port every day familyfriendly
our th trip with aida and as always absolutely completely satisfied we had the scottish highlights with aidadiva it was a pleasure to be able to visit our old lady of the sphinx class again after all the years with aidaprima and perla the waiters were as always very polite and attentive everything was very clean the housekeeping did a great job too the food tasted great and no one on board has starved unfortunately the weather wasnt great which meant that one port was cancelled but that can happen safety comes first and everyone should expect that at least once on a cruise not a problem for us so we had one more day of relaxation in conclusion we are looking forward to the next trip and keep realizing that for us at least there is no better way to travel the priceperformance ratio is still right
wonderful trip eventful moments beautiful memories
despite advance bookings over years ago the trip especially the excursions from aida were poorly prepared
aida mega as always next cruise is booked
we went on a cruise for the first time we were so impressed by the service the friendliness the cleanliness and the competence of all the staff the shore excursions were also very well organized and of course the ship is a thing of its own awesome well be back
great trip fantastic destinations the trip fully met my expectations
the friendliness and the range of services on board is overwhelming it was another wonderful and perfect holiday trip
very satisfied great first cruise that made us want more
nothing special anymore this was our th trip with aida and probably the last what bothers me most is that the boats are now packed which means there are waiting times or crowds on other ships it is normal for there to be meal times for example sometimes there are crowds or there is no room in the buffet restaurants the excursions are sometimes completely overpriced parking garage with shuttle bus for a distance of around km and a parking period of days for gt selfbooked parking garage and the taxi for three people cost me shuttle buses to the cities visited cost per person the journey took a maximum of minutes mind you without aida accompaniment just the transfer to the city and back the free sports courses are great overall a very average vacation which probably wont be remembered because of aida
great new ports on a very interesting continent
the aidaprima was too impersonal for us overall we had an unforgettable trip however we found the atmosphere on the prima very impersonal up to now we have always traveled on the mediumsized ships in the aida fleet and felt very comfortable the service staff were always friendly and cheerful and recognized their guests after a short time on the prima we encountered more and more badtempered employees and there was no sign of good humor anywhere well given the large number of guests thats probably not surprising in the end we were also glad that we had booked a junior suite and could therefore use the lounge and the partio deck as a place to retreat without these advantages it would have been terrible for us we once tried to find two loungers chairs or even a quieter place outside of it no chance on the stella luna diva we always retreated to deck and found peace there is no such place on the prima outside of the partio deck or the lounge so if we ever go on a cruise with one of the big aida ships again we tend to book based on the destinations rather than the ships well only book a suite without that it wouldnt have been a relaxing experience for us otherwise i can only recommend the arab emirates route its like diving into another world
incredibly familyfriendly trip to the canary islands with generations would definitely go again
everything went perfectly from checkin to checkout this aida trip was unique and highly recommended we will definitely be back on board
our holidays with aida are always very nice its up to each individual what they make of it but the team and the entire crew do so much to make sure were doing well no matter where you start bars housekeeping restaurants hosts shows and so much more it was all very nice the trip through japan was simply wonderful and you got a good impression
the weather was nice
unfortunately more quantity than quality aida unfortunately did not manage to achieve a great holiday result i would have expected a little more from this trip
thank you for the great trip aida is always something special
everything was so beautiful and we were very impressed we would love to go back again they were great islands
aida is a company where you feel comfortable from the start and are immediately in holiday mode
great trip great ports
traveling with aida is simply very pleasant and well organized you see a lot of the world are entertained but can also relax in peace
for that money you could have had a longer and nicer vacation
all our expectations were fulfilled it was a very nice cruise with aida
overall we had a nice trip we met nice people we encountered friendly and serviceoriented people everywhere in the service we got to know new cities
experience in entertaining holidaymakers good ideas in organizing leisure time and relaxation
another successful holiday we are looking forward to the next tour
i only travel with aida i just like everything i dont have to worry about anything and can enjoy my vacation to the fullest if you want to have a real vacation and get to know many countries and other cultures then travel with the aida fleet
aida has not evolved but rather has evolved away from the guest not a good prospect for me as i have been traveling with aida for over years now
aida cosma is a great ship lots of activities on board superbly equipped cabin delicious food great entertainment program friendly staff
fantastic spacious cabin with very comfortable upholstered furniture and a large balcony the stay is one big sales show in dense crowds animations of mario barth quality aprs ski atmosphere and elevator music large groups and inadequate seating bars are tiny and poorly stocked long wait to get a table no feeling of luxury
aidanova south norway junior suite pleasant clean new mostly a very quotlivelyquot trip with lots of families with children of all ages
it was a wonderful holiday on aidacosma for us everything was perfect and well organized we will come again
best service good entertainment and inspiration an important reason for choosing aida nova was the environmental aspect the ship was awarded the blue angel
it was a wonderful holiday we enjoyed every day and have many wonderful memories of the trip
overall it was a nice holiday on the aidanova
great relaxing holiday despite holiday season
family friendly great crew great service home feeling
perfect holiday to unwind very hospitable staff
the aida nova is much too big everything on board from leisure activities to restaurants to the kids area is much too small for the number of guests everything is full at all times and you never get that holiday feeling in addition the cabins are tiny compared to hotels the ship itself is so big that you often just stand in a container port and although the vacation is already pretty expensive a lot of things on board cost extra the shows are really nice but you have to get there early to get a seat there too overall a vacation with very little relaxation effect
you should definitely go on a cruise aida is recommended because of the still low language barrier and the highquality entertainment
the canary islands route was as always great beautiful destinations that you can always approach in a different way the aida cosma is too big and was far too full mass tourism without flair
it was my first trip with aida and i was more than thrilled the crew was more than competent and friendly
return journeys from tenerife must be organized in time
trip was fine except for the departure from tenerife
the nova is a great ship with lots of restaurants and leisure activities the food in the restaurants is always fresh and delicious with a huge changing selection the crew members are all in a good mood and helpful the fitness area is great with several free courses every day captain janauscheck provided the passengers with lots of interesting information every day great vacation we are already looking for the next travel destination
mega first trip on a ship and aida is awesome the crew is great i dont know what else to say but one thing is certain next year we are going as a group
it was a great trip that i would love to return to
this trip was perfectly organized by aida from the beginning to the end great
the complete package of experience and travel organization
to discover so many different cities and places in a short time is very precious
aida does a lot of quotchildish stuffquot and forgets that adults traveling alone also need to relax
aida cosma due to extreme noise in the first nights we had to change cabins twice sleeping was out of the question unfortunately it took several days and discussions before we were helped finally we paid an extra charge for a balcony cabin and were able to sleep for the last nights that was the th and last time on aida
it was fun and i will definitely travel with aida again
the aida has found new fansapart from a few minor things it was a great holidaywhich we will repeat again
it was simply a great trip with aida prima everything was super organized
its a wonderful experience to take your hotel from place to place pure relaxation and excitement
an allround carefree package if you dont want to worry about anything on holiday
have fun with the whole family from young to old theres something for everyone
great trip on the nova were going on aida for the th time and still think its good
it was our first aida trip we really enjoyed it and we will come again
despite a few minor things this was the best trip
welcomed and accompanied with a smile
from the very beginning it was a carefree and wonderful trip where you felt completely looked after and in good hands
very nice ship friendly and very serviceoriented crew everything very clean nice trips with many great experiences
get to know each other and gain experience on a cruise
aida offers very good value for money considering that you always have the hotel with you it is a very good opportunity to get to know different destinations
exploring the world in a wonderful way it couldnt be more pleasant
our trip with the nova was better
a trip that we only remember positively
when you travel so many times with aida you take a closer look at what has improved or what has turned out to be negative as far as the trips are concerned you can say that they have remained the same there used to be more going on in the evenings with the events on the pool deck many evenings were boring unless you were doing something with people you knew from the ship itself
i felt comfortable throughout the trip i booked the wrong excursion once but still had a great day i returned home refreshed and relaxed
the first but certainly not the last cruise
we spent a week on the aida cosma in the canary islands and madeira the weather was wonderful but the ship was extremely crowded the pools were full of children lots of drunks people were smoking despite the smoking ban a party ship the ideal vacation for people who just want to party and get drunk for a week the destinations were wonderful at this time of year pure sunshine
very nice trip
a wonderful holiday with lots of great experiences aida organized the excursions really well many thanks to the aida team for the great time i would love to travel with you again
great organization and super nice people crew and guests you see so much of the world and always have your home with you
since it was my first time on a cruise i still have to process my impressions it was a great experience certainly not the first or last trip
aida vacation means vacation from start to finish
i am very satisfied and feel comfortable on aida ships
an interesting trip unfortunately the ship was too big for me
once again a wonderful holiday with aida we were completely satisfied and were delighted by the kindness and friendliness of the crew
the priceperformance ratio is not right at all for the money that the trip cost you can have a luxury vacation even in the caribbean
it was my first cruise and my expectations were completely met i can only recommend aida cruises
first cruise and not disappointed id be happy to go again thank you for the wonderful moments and experiences
the trip along the norwegian coast and through the fjords was a special experience especially since it was winter and we had snow the trip was made particularly pleasant by the very friendly staff in all areas
except for the long walks from the elevator to the food the holiday was perfect we would love to come back heike salomon
the trip was great but for us the big aida ships are just childrens paradises we will prefer the smaller ships
as on previous trips with aida we were once again impressed by the ship the offers and above all the very friendly staff keep it up aida
perfect ship compliments to meyer werft wonderful jogging track great entertainment
great ship great trip canary islands wonderful holiday
very familyfriendly and uncomplicated depending on the trip and the time holidays the ships are very full and the quality suffers
mega ship and great tour
the trip to norway was very impressive and relaxing apart from the problems with getting there strikes at deutsche bahn and lufthansa it is highly recommended to get to know frosty norway
get to know other countries and many happy people
simply a lovely trip and a wonderful holiday id love to go again
a great team that takes care of everything youll never get bored holiday feeling guaranteed
another great aida vacation a few things are slipping at aida at the moment the trips are getting more expensive and the service in the bars and buffet restaurants is getting worse its still just about ok but a new concept to handle the number of passengers would be great
a dream an unforgettable trip with great excursions and culinary adventures met wonderful people
nice trip giant ship
many islands to see and discover in a short time
we travel at least twice a year this time it was the first time on a cruiseit was really a dream experience
beautiful ship
as always its great to be part of the aida family and discover other countries
an unforgettable journey in the orient with aida prima
great with aida travelling in the orient alternately from the modern city of dubai we drove to the highest building in the world burj khalifa at m to abu dhabi to the largest mosque to bahrain to the souk to sir bani yas nature reserve back to dubsi for the desert adventure oriental night
anyone who has ever been on a cruise will do it again and again our transvoyage on the aida diva from la romana to hamburg was a dream many thanks to the crew who made our trip an unforgettable experience
again good and careful travel
it was a great trip we will do another one next year
all trips with aida were incredibly beautiful experiences
i have been travelling with aida more or less regularly since i like this form of travelling
aida cruises are really recommendable
its great to be able to visit so many places in a short space of time and just have a vacation
there were great destinations and great people on board
daily excursions are the beall and endall of an aida trip this is the only way to find the right island for a longer stay
it was the worst transocean voyage i have ever done with aida it felt like a transport to the shipyard but not like a vacation trip where the goal is to make the guests comfortable there was hardly any program food and ingredients were missing ports were cancelled without replacement
beautiful ship beautiful trip beautiful excursions
the captains demeanor was very pleasant a great representative of the aida group thommy mller is a great incentive for me to book trips on the aida cosma i have already booked the next trip
great cruise
great trip in difficult times with strikes storms and politically questionable times the ship simply rocked super well
for me cruising is the best way to spend a holiday
i love traveling on cruises especially on the aidacosma that was my nd and the rd is coming in september
nice holiday in southern norway the nova is a great ship with lots of restaurants and leisure activities the food in the restaurants is always fresh and delicious with a huge changing selection the crew members are all in a good mood and very friendly
trip to preikestolen
great cruise nice people and tour guide
aida cosma canaries wonderful trip
aida meets my expectations of a cruise operator
we are absolutely delighted with aida and had some wonderful days on board the aida stella i would especially like to praise the staff who were always very friendly and helpful unfortunately the tui means of transport that were used during our trip did not meet the standard
the asia trip from bangkok to shanghai is worth experiencing excursions booked through aida rarely took place with a germanspeaking tour guide it was more common for parts of the excursion program to not take place without any cost reduction the japanese island and the port in taiwan offered little of interest in our opinion it is strongly recommended to exchange money for the countries in advance as us dollars are not accepted in chinese ports japan or vietnam
it was another great trip met nice people in january were going away again with aida on aidasehen
getting to know new countries and their culture and landscapes
it fits nice holiday
with just a few exceptions a very very nice trip with aidanova everyone was helpful and very friendly
we took an aida cruise to southern norwayit was very nice
it was an extraordinary transocean voyage with the aidaluna the caribbean part went according to plan the fiveday crossing to the azores was exciting because the weather was going to get worse due to several storms high waves on the onward journey from the azores to lisbon as well as the onward journey two days later to portsmouth england were a real seafaring experience for us the food was good and the service very attentive all in all we are looking forward to seeing aida again
the whole cruise was a great experience from start to finish organization of cabin food amp drink entertainment excursions etc i will definitely book another cruise with aida on the mediterranean route a big compliment to the captain and his crew for a wonderful vacation xx
relaxation on the ship
everything on aida was so indescribable that you would want to go on it again highly recommended thanks to the crew of aida cosma
it was a wonderful trip with many experiences beautiful weather good food and a lot of fun thank you aida stella
i had a great week on board the aidanova with super friendly staff who also did their job conscientiously so that we had a nice holiday on board many thanks to everyone who makes this possible and works so that others can have a nice holiday
i had a wonderful cruise that was perfectly organized and gave me great experiences
it was my first trip with aida i was very satisfied i would like to plan the next trip with aida as well
very good organization by aida when checking in on board and checking out very satisfied the whole route was beautiful the individual cities everything was perfect to explore on foot except oslo we explored this beautiful city with the hop on hop off bus very beautiful city
it was a pleasant stay
a trip with aida is always an enrichment for body mind and soul
on a caribbean tour with aidaperla what an indescribable fantastic experience absolutely relaxing absolutely impressive and i would be happy to go back anytime check in trip staff destinations weather moments of success moments of happiness food enough of everything for every taste cocktails enough of everything for every taste if anyone is moaning here then that is complaining at a high level and if people are too stingy to book all inclusive which amounts to per day on this trip then it is more than pathetic to fill up a water bottle at the drinks machine which is even figuratively forbidden
aida always a special holiday
great holiday great ship
the trip was great overall the staff were friendly everything was clean the food was fantastic the ports were well organized the only thing was the flights reservation and checking in independently which were total chaos this is only possible through aida for an additional charge unfortunately thats not so cool as thats where the vacation starts and ends
pleasant cruise
beautiful cruise to the abc islands would love to go again
top cruise very luxurious and neat boat nice staff
aida was very well organized despite the train strike and airport staff strike good excursions can also be booked in advance great spa area will definitely travel with aida again
the trip was again full of great impressions
aida trips are always highly recommended
everything worked smoothlyit was a great experience from the arrival to the journey home
it was our first cruise aidanova metropolises but definitely not the last because the next one is already booked we felt comfortable all around from the cabin to the service to the food it was wonderful despite the size and the number of guests you dont feel lost or cramped i cant understand the moaners thats complaining at a very high level we are definitely thrilled and are looking forward to the next trip
a very wellmaintained ship with very friendly staff a wonderful holiday experience with a high level of relaxation excellent food
each of our trips was always very well organized by aida whether in a home port or by plane the arrival or journey to the ship was always stressfree which is very important for us as we get older and years old
we stay with aida because for us they are the best
cruise very good
after the th trip with aida i can only say that my experiences are good
it was an allround successful trip
everything is done to ensure that you only have a holiday aida takes care of everything the service and the staff are also really great
nice memory of vacation
if we were to do another tour with aida we would only do it on the smaller ships as we didnt like the cosma at all compared to the smaller ships in the fleet we were particularly dissatisfied with the quality of the food and the snobbery of some of the german employees on board which led us to avoid the cosma and others in the future the ship is also very confusing and considering its only been around for years is already in a really shabby state we had a cabin on deck and couldnt sleep through the night because the staff started vacuuming the sun deck on deck at am sharp which sounded like the staff were standing next to your bed our last cruise on the aidablu was years ago and that tour was really great we hope that this trip was an exception
aida was once a symbol of the antihero among cruises no tuxedos at dinner no seating arrangements a relaxed and cool atmosphere and a great generous offer but now there is also a dress code at dinner and the offer is monetized at every turn crazy prices for drinks flat rates or internet access many things that were previously included in the price suddenly cost money and the technology on the ships eg luna and sol is now getting on in years and is not being replaced the entire it environment is a joke in and only works in emergency mode the onboard portal and information display are now topped by every provincial bus and yet everything is constantly getting more expensive unfortunately it is no longer as much fun as it used to be
we had a great time thank you very much the aidanova is a really beautiful ship despite its size there is always space and a quiet corner for everyone the service was above average everywhere
with aida travel it is like
i think its good that aida also cares about environmental protection and undertakes various activities
aidaluna jamaicahamburg febmarch good value for money beautiful route good food pleasant and friendly inside cabin would gladly go again
aidaluna good value for money beautiful route through the caribbean good food pleasant and friendly interior cabin we will continue to prefer the smallersmaller ships
from start to finish our aida orient cruise was an unforgettable experience that exceeded all expectations despite the challenges posed by strikes and bad weather aida ensured that our arrival and departure went smoothly with impressive efficiency and care even when the itinerary had to be changed due to these unforeseeable circumstances the team made sure that our experience was not compromised the culinary diversity on board deserves special recognition especially the special meals for people with allergies which were prepared with great care this detail shows aidas commitment to the wellbeing and satisfaction of all guests the staff on board were consistently friendly and helpful creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere their dedication and professionalism contributed significantly to us feeling comfortable and safe almost throughout the cruises value for money was excellent it is rare to find a travel experience that is both luxurious and economical and aida has mastered this balance perfectly during our trip we had the opportunity to take part in two shore excursions the first shore excursion was excellently organized and gave us deep insights into the local culture and history unfortunately the second shore excursion did not quite reach the same high level but such variations are to be expected on adventures of this kind overall aida offered an incomparable cruise experience that will remain a positive memory despite a few minor obstacles i can highly recommend an aida orient cruise and am already looking forward to the next adventure with aida
everything was great and i would love to travel with aida again
it was our first time on a cruise and we really enjoyed it aida solved all problems well and the excursions on offer were also very good the food was delicious and there was a huge selection of restaurants you were spoiled for choice the shows were also great and the staff were super friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and nice but still big enough and better than expected the only thing you could criticize was that there was no internet and the package was very expensive but maybe that will be improved at some point it was worth the trip and we will definitely recommend aida to others
aida is always beautiful exciting and entertaining a great time for vacation
the aidanova is clearly too big for us however it is ideal for families with lots of children we prefer to stay on smaller ships eg aidastella aidadiva etc because we dont need the excessive range of amenities that the larger ships have we appreciate taking a city tour organized by aida and then having the option of staying in the city and returning to the ship on our own
aida is good value for money everything was really good on this last trip on the bella only the hotel manager was a disaster but vacation and excursions were top
for everyone always suggestions offers and absolute holiday feeling
it was now our th trip and apart from a few minor details we were very satisfied with the entire trip
a fantastic experience on the aidaperla the days in the caribbean were unforgettable and gave us a lot of new energy and strength
we are always amazed that everything is so well thought out and planned even when the weather like on our trip with the luna goes against the plan
my wife and i were able to enjoy this trip with aidaluna to the fullest we met some interesting people and were pampered in the rossini gourmet restaurant
wonderful cruise from la romana to hamburg with many days at sea with a great onboard program and lots of good music endless opportunities to do sports excellent lecturers on board and an allround successful overall concept
beautiful caribbean cruise followed by a transatlantic crossing we traveled with the aida luna from jamaica to hamburg great ports and super friendly staff
the first cruise was really great everything was perfect the journey there was great the people on board were very nice you were welcomed in a friendly manner everywhere the excursions were very good the quality of the food is great the selection is great too there is something for every taste
awesome we are still amazed by the friendliness of the crew how nice to see that there are still nice people thank you for a wonderful trip
we have been very satisfied with every aida trip so far the priceperformance ratio has always been good
it was my first time in this area its a shame that immigration to certain countries took so long it dampened my good mood a bit
aida is always worth a trip simply great
the trip was very relaxing and successful
the trip was well prepared staff except for some reception were very friendly and nice everywhere the long queues in certain countries for immigration taiwanishigaki and shanghei were a hassle
aidas big winter cruise is really highly recommended fantastic landscapes endless northern lights an overall cool country
it was our second aida cruise and we were very satisfied with the service cleanliness and organization on board in some places on the ship you could see and feel the age of the ship but that didnt affect our comfort the onboard program was top class you should check the excursions on offer very carefully as the priceperformance ratio was not always right
that you really feel at home on the aida
the cruise was a new experience for me the aida excursions were a nobrainer they were mostly just tourist fare
compared to previous trips there is a downward trend excursions without love and a not so good guide
holidays for every target group whether wellness peace and quiet seekers globetrotters or party people aida has it all
great very nice holiday would definitely go back
everything was very well organized and well thought out there were no complaints from our point of view family trip i can only recommend aida sol
a cruise i want to quickly forget
the actual trip with aida was very good
the slogan quotwelcome homequot fits very well the entire crew was always friendly and courteous the cleaning staff do a great job the next cruise is being planned and will be with aida again thank you for two wonderful weeks
we are very satisfied the organization helpfulness cleanliness everything was perfect we will definitely make many more trips and recommend it to others
we have been sailing for ten years now and for the last two years with our son we still have a lot of fun and enjoy discovering the world with aida
everything was as expected ship weather destinations what more could you want
we had a great and eventful trip to the north cape
a dream vacation that exceeded all expectations
we had a nice trip that we were only able to finish after years due to the corona outbreak in march on the aidanova
the good organization of this trip is overwhelming simply an allround carefree package thats how vacations are fun
all in all a successful and beautiful trip
i had the impression that the crew really and honestly enjoyed traveling with us
the first trip did not surpass or reach this trip
it was our first cruise trip and it will remain unforgettable
aida prima is a very beautiful and wellmaintained ship the food is very good and there is everything your heart desires the staff are very helpful and incredibly friendly thank you for the lovely and comfortable time on board we will be back
everything was great dream trip with a great ferling on board would love to go again
aida offers a perfect holiday experience with perfect service
very good preparation and execution of the trip by aida
aida is cool aida offers a lowthreshold cruise experience for everyone the priceperformance ratio is already good in the standard package and one or two additional comfort features can be booked later if you want
it was our first cruise with the aidanova metropolen and our expectations were exceeded the entire staff crew were courteous helpful and friendly despite the number of travelers aidanova we never had to wait long at the bars or restaurants everything was clean and all the information on board was very helpful the excursions booked through aida were very well planned and implemented we learned a lot from the tour guides this was not our last trip with the aida we will be back best wishes andr amp peggy
traveling with aida is always an experience
i am a fan of aida trips and have never been disappointed i am already looking forward to the next trip because i know what to expect
aida cosma we have been on the cosma for the second time in weeks and were very impressed again although there were so many people on board it was very well distributed the service staff are always friendly and helpful the cabins are always clean the food is consistently excellent but there are still fellow travelers who find something to complain about we can only recommend aida from arrival to departure guests are well looked after
wonderful trip
it is always a wonderful moment to travel with aida
for the first time we went abroad outside of europe with aida a new experience that was great
i will always travel on the aida
good organization interesting excursions beautiful travel moments good rest
great cruise would love to go again
if you want to try out cruises aida is the right choice the next trip will be with aida again
very relaxing holiday and very beautiful scenery with many great sights overall i am very satisfied and will continue to plan my holidays with aida in the future
day trip with the aida nova it was very very nice
we went on the ship with mixed feelings as we hadnt really been behind the concept in recent years we were very positively surprised a great trip on the prima thank you for that
aida is always relaxed and cheerful with lots of contact with nice people
great caribbean tour with aida perla everything was very well organized including the arrival and departure great food good entertainment beautiful ports and great excursions it was now our th tour with aida and it was not the last
a very nice cruise
the aida cruise was a disappointing experience the service left a lot to be desired with disorganized staff who seemed overwhelmed the pool was tiny and crowded and it was nearly impossible to find a spot on the loungers as they were all reserved every day without the crew taking any measures to control this overall the experience was far below our expectations and i would not recommend this cruise
a fantastic days with aidaperla caribbean islands route fromto la romana only days at sea not connected visited a total of islands ship and service perfect everything was well organized including the numerous excursions on offer super delicious food and super friendly staff we would especially like to mention our room boy navadeep naik on deck who was always friendly and helpful and always did his job perfectly we would also like to recommend mr eknath gadkari mr andi hidayat and ms indah lemstari in the quotweite weltquot restaurant they always found a table for us spoiled us and were super nice
with aida through the caribbean absolutely recommended
caribbean trip with aidaperla simply fantastic
except for a few minor defects the trip was fine
nice trip but the excursions are far too expensive so book everything on site
my first cruise and im sure it wont be the last and whats also certain is only with aida
the cruise was a very enjoyable experience
aida cruises organizes the trips very well
the effort to please everyone and ensure a pleasant holiday
unfortunately we had an extremely disappointing experience during our planned aida cruise it is unfortunate that we were not allowed to travel with aida due to the nationality of my parents who are iranian and have valid schengen visas this experience made us feel discriminated against at a time when diversity and inclusion should be highly valued it is highly unfortunate that such prejudices still exist this experience was not only disappointing but also extremely embarrassing for an established cruise line like aida i will never forget this disparity
never again seven days of cruising and four days of being seriously ill with a stomachintestinal infection thank you never again
it was the th aida trip and it was as good and pleasant as the trips before nowhere have i had a better rest than on the aida ships
very well organized and we are satisfied and will recommend aida cruise
it was six wonderful weeks
february stars a week on the nova south norway from hamburg the ship was extremely full staff very friendly but sometimes overwhelmed eg at the bars restaurants overcrowded shows and musicians not as good as on the cosma person cabin very cramped fitness studio and time machine restaurant absolute highlight october stars super great vacation on the cosma mediterranean treasures week very friendly staff and very professional everything clean and well maintained great shows and live music huge selection of food and drink especially vegetarian something for everyone fitness studio everything available everything well organized time machine restaurant absolute highlight
our trip was very well organized i always travel with hahnreisen where i always have a competent contact person the arrival and departure as well as the support on board work excellently
aida blue seychelles and mauritius we have always enjoyed traveling with aida unfortunately the overall quality has suffered significantly no housekeeping for days in a row far too few staff at the counters significantly reduced food and abysmal event management honest feedback is met with answers that are of no help aida has completely disappeared from our travel planning and not just for us
service and friendliness as well as well organized trips together a very good holiday
great experiences on our st aida trip
very nice route dubai abu dhabi manamakhalifa bin salman port sir bani yas and dubai super ship aidaprima many nice encounters the food in the buffet restaurants was delicious very friendly staff very good entertainment very good bars
it was really nice we felt very comfortable all around it was our first cruise but definitely not our last
aida trips are always great
as always it was a great trip
it was a nice wellorganized trip that you will remember fondly
i have had a very good experience with aida of course things go wrong sometimes but these are minor things all in all it is always a relaxing experience
i dont know anyone who doesnt like aida trips that says it all
i really enjoyed this trip around the world the many events on board the great excursions and especially the surprises the glacier passage sailing around cape horn and pitcairn were overwhelming simply fantastic
it was a wonderful trip
great ship very friendly team on board everything super clean great food interesting excursions sometimes somewhat disinterested scouts but all in all a great experience in the persian gulf
i felt very comfortable and well informed everything was as i imagined it would be i would be happy to travel with aida again
wonderful trip great cruise ship
you are well looked after from arrival to departure aida has a perfectly thoughtout concept
super holiday stressfree and super relaxed
an indescribably beautiful cruise with fantastic destinations great service everything was well organized we were completely satisfied
get to know the country and its people experience other cultures and landscapes
interesting trip saw a lot of new things
great group trip great buffet good service everywhere great artists and singers great experiences on the island tours
unforgettable fantastic you cant describe it you have to experience it the ship the team the trip are a dream the trip was worth every cent thank you
aida is a feeling
a holiday with aida is simply carefree superbly organised and very relaxing until next time
i booked this trip because it fit into our entire vacation plan but not because i like aida what bothers me about aida is that i have to pay extra for a lot of things and i have to rely primarily on buffet restaurants i prefer allinclusive ships
arrival and departure were very well organized without having to lug a lot of luggage around you could feel your vacation from the very first minute
many contacts with fellow travelers
the trip was a highlight we were very satisfied
the cruise is well organized checkin and checkout are quick the restaurants on board are good the route is interesting we felt that the aida excursions we booked could be greatly improved they did not always correspond to the services advertised the use of towels to occupy the loungers by the pool as a quotreservationquot for hours on sea days should be stopped
the cruise with aida perla was a very nice experience for us we especially enjoyed the shows in the theatrium and the many excursions
i always had the feeling that every employee on the ship was trying to help the guests enjoy their vacation as pleasantly and beautifully as possible
very nice route many nice encounters very good food very friendly staff very good entertainment nice onboard newspaper unfortunately expensive and not so wellfunctioning internet
this was our first cruise with aida after having already been on a few cruises we were finally not disappointed and were completely satisfied apart from a few minor things very good food and the concept of the specialty restaurants is very popular with us as we are not really into buffets we can imagine traveling with aida again on the big ships
i am super satisfied and am waiting for my next aida cruise to norway with the whole family
complete travel experience
super nice first cruise we would do it again
unfortunately mass tourism has arrived here too and everything is now only done in mass processing the local aida moments whether during a great meal or in the sauna or in a bar are probably a thing of the past unfortunately it was probably our last cruise
an aida trip is wonderful for me
aida is pure relaxation everything is on offer partying peace and quiet great food great experiences great travel destinations very friendly and grateful staff who made us feel even better about how good we are that we can treat ourselves to such a trip
i found this trip very nice and always enjoy traveling with aida
aida trip was nice overall except for a few minor things
it was a nice vacation compared to previous trips however it doesnt get any better
simply indescribably beautiful moments
the cosma is a great ship you dont notice the many travelers because there are so many lounge areas everything is very well organized nice activity areas such as sports and fitness also suitable for children unfortunately the sauna area doesnt have enough outdoor loungers otherwise highly recommended all round
it was my first tour with aida and i was very satisfied with the service the food and also the excursions
great itinerary with wonderful experiences very friendly staff
it was a very nice vacation trip
concept excursion new destination and entertainment
we are firsttimers not just with aida but with cruises in general we really enjoyed it well go again
i am very satisfied with the aida cruises
over trips speak for themselves
i just feel good when i vacation on an aida ship
always happy to take an aida cruise full pampering program
an absolute dream holiday with many emotional moments in a feelgood atmosphere at aida smiles are at home
aida is now just mass tourism on the day at sea there wasnt a single spot where you could lay down your beach towel all the loungers were taken and reserved with towels from am with so many people whether on deck or in the restaurants it was just pure stress although the journey by ship from abu dhabi to dubai was only short the time was spent at sea to save on berthing fees this gave you little time to visit the cities in return aida charges high prices for the excursions the only praiseworthy point the food is varied and tasty but that doesnt make up for all the stress and aidas ships we were on the aidaprima are getting bigger and bigger as always its all about the money
great trip and route in indian ocean
it was a very nice vacation
it was our first time traveling with aida and our expectations were exceeded we were thrilled with the aidaperla and especially with the excellent service
the trip was interesting the excursions in the cities should have been more varied and the excursion prices cheaper
well organized trip very nice route aida diva a bit old but still clean super service
it was a very nice relaxing and active holiday
the best trip of my life world tour with aida sol
good rest and relaxation i can definitely recommend it
i gained a lot of new and wonderful impressions met nice people and felt very comfortable on board during the trip
for us older people the holiday was very important if our health allows we will see each other again on board soon
a nice trip with aida
the aida trips we have been on since have always been wonderful with lovely moments and very friendly staff for us there is nothing better than being on one of the aida ships
an eventful trip with very beautiful destinations
the overall experience was very good i can only recommend aida trips
the ports we visited in the caribbean were the most important thing for me on this trip
i have complete confidence but have no further experience as this was my first cruise
first cruise wonderful trip
good value for money for a trip of days very good service and varied entertainment on sea days
we spent two weeks in the indian ocean from mauritius the route is highly recommended great ports and lots of excursion options the weather was lovely and it was a good break from the german winter the staff on board made sure that we could enjoy our holiday at all times and that we didnt miss anything the food was great in all restaurants there was a good selection of dishes at every meal lots of variety the drinks are great and its worth booking a drinks package we tried and tested the drinks menu especially cocktails from top to bottom we had absolute peace and quiet in our balcony cabin and could enjoy the view all in all a dream holiday
it was my first cruise through the caribbean and i really enjoyed it we had good weather the whole time and our excursions with the local guides with one exception were great
was a good trip
you feel welcome and can enjoy your vacation from the moment you check in on the ship
it was my third holiday with aida we really enjoyed it and will definitely book again
it was a relaxing holiday with very friendly staff who were always approachable and tried to fulfill wishes
great trip to the caribbean great ports great excursions great ship and above all super friendly courteous and helpful staff thank you very much
a very nice trip with aida in the caribbean
trip very nice
a great trip days to escape the winter with a good price performance ratio i had to book
simply spent a nicer holiday
all in all a nice trip
without information the holiday is only half as nice
great trip with exciting ports the caribbeancentral america tour was great interesting and varied ports you immediately felt at home on aida luna great crew extremely friendly helpful and courteous staff from the chambermaids to the service in the restaurants bartenders reception fitness amp wellness team that really made you enjoy your vacation
i had seven unforgettable days on aida super organized very friendly staff great varied food im looking forward to the next trip with aida
we have travelled around the world with aida many times we always had a great holiday
always beautiful this was the third time we were on the aida nova more by chance as we looked at the routes and because of our vacation so we ended up on the nova three times but that didnt matter because on every trip you discovered a new corner that you hadnt seen before really recommendable
first cruise great experience
my first aida trip short version we booked the next aida for next year the day after our return
the aidaperla is a very beautiful ship the staff was always very nice and helpful
good balance between new experiences and relaxation
we really enjoyed our trip the service was fantastic and the staff very friendly thank you for the wonderful trip
we cannot recommend aida blu we only did the cruise because of the route the cabin especially the bathroom was dirty drains smelled and unfortunately the bathroom was hardly cleaned we had to complain several times before it was finally cleaned is that how you want to start your vacation it was really a hassle excursions were a total disaster one bill was incorrectly entered and was not corrected until we left despite repeated inquiries and promises the service staff in the market restaurant were the worst only interested in tips dirty dishes were laid out we have never had such a bad cruise
the whole trip was an experience aida needs to check and monitor the excursions better
we had good experiences with aida on our world tour
everything was well organized as always the trip was an absolute experience because of the whale watching
super great route weather was great too lots of activities great crew
for us it was a very relaxing holiday we learned a lot about the culture customs and traditions we especially liked the friendliness of the people and the fact that they accept each other regardless of their religion
aida is worth a trip i would always recommend these cruises
we enjoyed our vacation in our own way we are satisfied
everything otherwise we wouldnt have traveled with aida times
excellent organization from the outbound flight to the return flight great relaxation good food and great staff
great trip
great experience with kids so far the family trip of a lifetime
it was another fantastic trip with the aida perla
a great interesting and wellorganized vacation we always feel like we are in another world on the aida ships
was on tour with the nova in october the first time with aida otherwise always with the phoenix fleet after some skepticism i was very pleasantly surprised it makes a difference whether you travel with passengers phoenix or with over people the service and organization were great the crew was always friendly and accommodating the excursion program and the evening entertainment were very good i would be happy to come back
multinational family with lots of charm and energy to offer the best holiday experience
the days in the caribbean were very interesting the ship and the crew are a dream
we had a wonderful trip to the caribbean everything was perfect from the ship the really great food to the extremely friendly and helpful staff the whole process was just great
great service outstanding offers great facilities and very friendly staff gave me an unforgettable holiday i would gladly come again
a vacation on aida is like coming home you just feel good
on numerous trips to different travel areas always high quality and a balanced priceperformance ratio
on the whole everything works but there are many little things that spoil the holiday mood
it was my first time on a sea voyage so i cant say much just one thing i was very satisfied all around
great route and no flight top entertainment and so on and so on
i can only say it was a pleasure to travel with aida
attractive trip in the best quality with a lot of commitment on the part of aida thank you very much aidanova
the evaluation of the aida trip must always correspond to the truth so that every reader can get a true picture
great trip
great trip an experience for all senses
wonderful organization great entertainment very friendly staff cleanliness right down to the lowest decks lots of joy and laughter and good food made this trip a special memory for us
an incredible experience
we were able to be with our friends every day and still retreat to our cabin for us a cruise is a place to relax with friends
great family adventure with great food wellness childcare and friendly staff and professional crew
they try to make the trip as pleasant as possible for the travellers which they also succeed in doing
great trip and well organized moderate prices
st cruise positively surprised
you cant go wrong with aida travel its a company that really cares about the wellbeing of its travelers despite the bad weather we didnt regret anything
great trip very nice environment on board great service and the priceperformance ratio is top notch highly recommended
it was a relaxing trip and our expectations were fulfilled
it was a great holiday we will come back
so far satisfied with the booking process clear guidelines for booking excursions app clearly designed
great trip lots of ports relaxing days at sea lots of activities creative sporty informative excellent food no shuttle in several ports bad exchange rates for foreign currencies excessive prices for bodyampsoul activities
very nice trip on a great ship
incredibly friendly staff this applies to the entire crew family atmosphere on board the selection of destinations for the world tour is hard to beat it was an allround wonderful experience
it was a very good trip
we traveled with aida for the th time and were once again completely satisfied relaxed atmosphere very good organization noticeable team spirit at all levels of the hierarchy great willingness to help great food reliable information you have to be careful when booking excursions quoton your ownquot an individual excursion is often better this time indian ocean the excursions were very expensive but there were good introductions so you can also book on board
all around nice and friendly staff huge selection at the buffet with tasty offerings free drinks with meals interesting travel lectures in front of each port extensive library many different entertainment options during the day new evening program in the theater every day then dancing opportunities in several bars
it was a fantastic trip that left nothing to be desired even my husbands birthday was not forgotten
we can find peace and relaxation when we want or we can go to the pool deck if we want to listen to music there are always suitable places to lie down
my husband and i have already been on aida times we have seen many ships and countries we are enchanted every time of course there are small problems here and there but most of them are dealt with or solved immediately we are already looking forward to our next trip and say see you on aida
super nice cruise very professional and all really all of the staff super friendly and always in a good mood
it was our first time travelling with aida and we enjoyed it so much that we have booked the next trip again i can only recommend it
a wonderful trip many thanks to the incredibly great crew of the aidasol we will definitely travel with aida again
nothing went wrong the aida crew offered us a unique vacation all expectations were met with the highest quality we will continue to travel with aida in the future
my third big trip with aida wonderful friendships are formed every time and they really last for years you see each other again by chance on a new trip and off you go do you remember when we i also include crew members in this thats what makes the aida family so special
great itinerary even though we visited some ports earlier
it was a very nice trip
very nice cruise from sydney to hamburg we spent lovely days on board the cleanliness on board was exemplary very good food in all restaurants all crew members were always smiling thank you for the great holiday
a very great trip with many nice hours and friendly staff the only thing that is a bit off is that you dont get water without paying for it
it was great everyone on aida made an effort to ensure that we had an unforgettable vacation unfortunately the ship was very full during the holidays unfortunately im stuck with that time
dream vacation great team on board
nice destination good and friendly service good food friendly and good service
great we had very nice days
our return flight was cancelled aida didnt mind we got no support from aida even though we had a package holiday through aida we had to organise everything ourselves finding a hotel was difficult all the hotels were fully booked other fellow travellers who had booked through schauinsland received full support from their tour operator i would have liked this from aida too i will have to think twice about seeing aida in the future we are very disappointed with aida and their behaviour
we always like to travel with aida because the priceperformance ratio is right
basically another great holiday with only minor restrictions
to experience an aida ship for once each ship has its own flair and it is a question of personal taste as to who feels most comfortable where
you feel welcome as a guest every member of staff from the cleaner to the captain makes you feel valued as a guest you also meet many guests and crew members again and again which makes the trips something special
it was a great and varied experience on the ship interesting shore excursions created special highlights everything was done to make the travelers feel comfortable a big thank you to the entire team
aida employees were friendly hardworking and courteous the excursions were very well organized and carried out the food was good and varied there are so many activities on offer and there is also relaxation great
such a great trip that was almost perfect for me the only criticism i have is that many of the excursions organized by aida were only conducted in english but not everyone speaks perfect english
we had a great trip with the aida nova and felt very comfortable on board
it was an unforgettable and wonderful trip that we were able to experience on board the aida perla and a big compliment to aida who made it possible for us to get to the ship on time with condor without any problems and despite the announced strike on february st many thanks also to our captain schmid and the entire crew thank you thank you thank you
it was very nice and we will book a cruise with aida again
i have no comparison to other cruise companies so far but im not interested in doing so either as ive always felt very comfortable with aida the only thing that has gone down is the fruit selection in the restaurants
very nice cruise
spent a fantastic holiday with my yearold son relaxation was just as possible as action and each of us was happy in our own way the excursions were fantastic
itinerary great ships
day caribbean trip everything was simply top notch service is very important here and the excursions offered were simply great
the booked trip was completed as announced
all in all a nice holiday with small deficits
aida is a very customeroriented provider of cruises we were very satisfied
itinerary
it was great and a very pleasant tour the staff is always friendly
it is always a wonderful holiday
we were in norway with aida nova a very nice tour almost all the cities can be explored on foot from the harbor the excursions offered are also very nice the service on the ship is excellent as is the food and the spa amp wellness everything is very clean all the staff are friendly and hardworking actually no wishes are left unfulfilled and we enjoyed the vacation
everything was to our liking thank you aida
great holiday great team
i am very happy to have sailed such a beautiful ship there is nothing lacking in quality
our flight was cancelled and aida simply let us down despite the arrivaldeparture package the trip was only ok so i do not recommend a trip with aida
great vacation thank you aida again
everything good except the travel prices
all our expectations were fulfilled it was a very nice holiday
aidasee sail away
a highly recommended trip
aida ok you can hardly book excursions anymore
great for families lots to do nice childcare and lots on offer for children who can travel independently on the boat very relaxing
great exciting vacation trip with many impressions very good food sports and relaxation options and entertainment at a high level
i always felt welcome the cabins are big enough and immaculately clean the crew is courteous helpful and super nice the smiles are a given here i love vacations on the nova even though it is huge and there are thousands of people on board i am always surprised by the professionalism of the crew everything just works
i generally enjoyed the trip
friendly and helpful staff the information about the travel destinations was also particularly good the gym bingo and puzzles were nice on days at sea unfortunately i dont like the slot machines in the casino i would like to play roulette with staff and people i liked the magician
the prima is a wonderful ship the great dubai trip was simply perfect thank you for these great memories
great trip we would love to come back
great organization by aida especially since our flight was at risk due to a strike brought forward a day super friendly reception and everything prepared for sleeping in the public areas thank you
all in all a great trip but there are also some critical points that need to be worked on
it was a rich cruise experience
services simply everything for vacation and relaxation
aida trips are always an experience although on my fifth cruise i noticed that the service is getting worse and less accommodating
traveling with aida is recommended a little independence is appropriate
very very nice and highquality trip with the aida cosma from tenerife via fuerteventura lanzarote grand canaria and madeira even though we usually like to travel with costa and msc aida completely convinced us
we had a lot of fun and were able to relax
it was a great trip with a team of good souls who fulfilled our every wish we felt very comfortable
we were traveling in a larger group and it was a very nice vacation
good value for money on the ships of the aida fleet completely satisfied when traveling on the sphinx class ships
you will not miss anything when you travel with aida the friendly staff do everything to make you feel comfortable and enjoy your vacation the very high quality never fails whether in the food the cleanliness the great entertainment and above all in the organizational talent on the ships i would recommend these trips to every good friend with a clear conscience and it was not the last trip thank you aida
sailing on the aidablue cruise ship in the indian ocean was an unforgettable experience for my entire life it was a great vacation with great staff and services i was extremely satisfied
aidacosma is a desert of service from an untidy room at the start of the vacation to a mediocre reception uncleared tables in the restaurants with unmotivated service staff its a shame not a good first trip with aida for this not cheap vacation but overall the ship and the travel destinations were completely fine
everything ok very satisfied with the trip
an allround wonderful holiday thanks to the crew of the aida prima
nice trip unfortunately only english speaking excursions
a very nice trip to the big cities from hamburg despite the strong wind and the change of route it was once again a very nice trip great captain great crew
the trip was varied and we saw many caribbean islands and cities in central america a few days at sea
great organization everything just works at aida great offers on board something for everyone unfortunately was not possible of course you have to do without some quotnice to havequot things at aida these days but it is still a great shipping company that really makes an effort for its guests
nice trip everything well organized however there were problems with orientation as aidacosma is a very large ship is definitely recommended with children
we only had positive experiences on our first aida trip i particularly like the helpfulness of people with disabilities the cabins were well furnished and it was great to have a balcony the room service was also great overall i give the crew a very good rating they do everything to ensure you have a great vacation
an eventful trip friendly staff the show was really good i really liked the band on the pool deck and in the aida bar the bike trips were just as good a really nice holiday see you on aida
we have been sailing with aida for many years for the most part the holidays have been lovely although we have noticed a noticeable decline in service and significant price increases over time however compared to other companies aida still does very well
very satisfied with the whole trip gained a lot of new impressions met nice people super nice crew
always worth a trip great vacation and beautiful ship saw a lot and experienced a lot again and again
we experienced our first cruise with aida we had booked a balcony cabin with a comfort deluxe drinks package unfortunately although aida had confirmed this we did not actually get this drinks package the reason given was that the travel agency had not booked it this resulted in enormous additional costs for us
a convenient way to travel for older people
i have already been on a few aida cruises so far i have liked the aida stella the most no complaints just great i would definitely go back
it was a wonderful holiday with aida nice and friendly staff clean comfortable cabins delicious food great selection of tours spa
everything was perfect for me fitness relaxation meeting nice people
i felt comfortable the friendly and nice staff enhanced the holiday feeling
very good advice before and during the entire trip
another cruise with aida after years the priceperformance ratio is just right restaurant offers activities all logistics are great checkin and checkout absolutely professional with no chaos
it was a successful relaxation with excellent ambience food and entertainment on board
we traveled with the aida cosma it was a great trip we will continue to travel with aida
it was my first cruise and it was an indescribably beautiful holiday on the aida cosma
anyone who books the arrival package with aida will be able to relax right from the start of their vacation once on board the allround wellness program and friendly reception begins straight away
the aida nova is a very beautiful modern ship even though there are so many people on board the crew has everything under control if there are any problems the crew tries to solve them i would love to come back
was a great trip
for our first trip we were very satisfiedwe have no comparison yet
relaxed and luxurious travel to the metropolises of europe its fun to watch the docking and unmooring maneuvers to wake up in a different country in the morning and to be pampered with culinary delights
well planned trip from the first minute everything was very straightforward no long waiting times everything was doable with a child very friendly and helpful staff
great trip always happy to do it again
it was a wonderful trip that we would do again and again
it was a wonderful and relaxing trip great service and top hospitality again and again
great cruising area unfortunately weather problems at the beginning excursions ok seychelles fantastic tendering works smoothly
everything there is on the aida
the trip was well organized and the stay on board was flawless
it was our seventh cruise with aida it was nice but the ship was so airconditioned that my husband and i each spent three days in the cabin
an allround superbly organised holiday i would go again anytime
it was one of the most beautiful trips we have taken
my th aida trip and always very satisfied and come home rested with many impressions
very good entertainment very good organization great vacation with lots of options would go again anytime
aida offers a variety of options for planning your vacation on board
nice cruise on a modern ship friendly crew good food and interesting ports
an allround successful first cruise
we felt welcome and comfortable from the first to the last day
it was a very nice trip despite the size of the ship
the caribbean tour on the aida perla was fantastic the ship is electric has a saltwater treatment plant sewage treatment plant waste treatment plant and is a beautiful ship overall not too overloaded with guests and the large number of restaurants meant that it was possible to eat in a relaxed manner everywhere the crew from the captain to the cleaning crew were super nice helpful and in a good mood the atmosphere on board was uniquely good
it was a beautiful trip with the aidacosmar
we really enjoyed the cruise except for the issue with the visa for madagascar
actually our aida cruises have always been very nice unfortunately this time it was just stress and no relaxation whether at the bar or while eating exploring the ship was not much fun either what a pity
it was a wonderful cruise we will always travel with aida again aida can always send us an offer even at short notice the food was great and the ship was very clean
aida has been the perfect way to travel for me since
always worth a trip we love aida
great days on board and on land and super organized by aida
it was a great trip i can only recommend aidaluna
it was our first time on a cruise and we were very impressed aida did everything right and provided an unforgettable trip to the orient
caribbean great experience as a family
the tour packages are not good and overpriced
despite the snow chaos in frankfurt and the pilot strike on the return flight the aida team managed everything very well everyone on board is friendly and helpful we are already looking forward to the next trip
the last trip on the cosma was a disaster for us as a couple we felt like we were in an oversized kindergarten during the day and like we were at ballermann in the evening please build small ships again or offer adultsonly trips
the trip was great thanks to the cosma team well be back on board
great relaxing holiday no boredom but also quiet corners visited beautiful ports very friendly and courteous staff would happily come back again
despite the large number of people we had a relaxed delicious and completely carefree holiday the aida team is super organized always friendly and the food was once again excellent
great relaxation entertainment if you want my hotel shows me the world true
second time traveling in helios class everything was great i like the size and the selection
i have traveled with the aida fleet several times i like it and can always recommend it
we had a wonderful holiday
my expectations were completely fulfilled i had a really relaxing holiday
very nice and relaxing cruise some details could be improved but i would gladly go again
aida has developed its own super concept keep it up and every trip is different no two fingers are the same
our first cruise and we were completely thrilled the whole team is great we will book again soon thank you to aidaprima
we took a trip on the aidanova from january th to th it was stormy and the ship was full we thought the trip was great and our expectations were met we were particularly impressed by the dance classes on board our special thanks go to lisa the local dance teacher lisa was very good at giving everyone something to take away she is a real asset to a lovely stay on board if you like dancing kathrin and uwe
dubai with aidaa great experience
a wonderful time on board aida cosma
we were very happy with everything on the cruise
beautiful ship and tour reports
for me it was the first trip on the aidanova hamburg copenhagen oslo i have to say it was worth every cent probably the most beautiful and relaxing vacation in my history simply fantastic
overall i was happy with the cruise but sharing a cabin with a friend was quite stressful i would like to be able to stay in a balcony cabin for myself at an acceptable price and the range of options for singles could be increased
you should not order such old vehicles for your trips
it was our first cruise and we were very pleasantly surprised the crew was very friendly and helpful the food was tasty and plentiful the housekeeping was hardworking and conscientious and the entertainment was excellent most of the excursions were very informative and varied although on two occasions it was a little unsatisfactory but overall we can only recommend aida and have already booked our next cruise
our first cruise with lots of great impressions everything was very well organized at first we were very skeptical because of the number of people but it was pretty much smooth sailing there is so much on offer that there is something for everyone whether it is in the wellness sports or restaurant area entertaining program something for everyone
i highly recommend the trip the only disadvantage is paid internet the one they offer for free doesnt work
very good travel organization friendly and committed staff good information about the respective destinations it was a very nice cruise
wonderful trip with aidaperla in the caribbean arrival and departure with discover airlines very good service and staff super friendly and helpful it was very nice and relaxing weeks
super wellorganized vacation perfect for the number of passengers
since it was our first trip we only had positive experiences more like this
i came back from my first cruise very excited for me the stay on the aidanova and the shore excursions were a great experience and contributed to me taking more trips in the future
for my first cruise i was more than satisfied i was on the stella from january th to january th
we were very satisfied it was a wonderful holiday
aida offers a unique and great allround carefree program for all ages there is a lot to do on the ship and you can also discover new things on shore excursions and even go on adventure and experience tours alternatively you can just chill out on board with cocktails
i love my aida trips and will always travel with the kussmund fleet
we had a great cruise a fantastic cruise ship is the aida cosma equipped with all amenities the service on board is excellent the aida cosma is very large before you get to know your way around the ship it will take a few days
i have been very satisfied with every trip so far and already feel at home on aida
the actual organization was very good you had a contact person before the trip by phone or email
everything just fits all aida employees work very hard to make the holiday perfect
unfortunately aida is no longer what it was a few years ago the quality has already gone downhill and it costs a lot of money the older ships need a general overhaul metal splinters and broken lamps in the childrens pool dirty carpets and everything somehow not attractive the buffet restaurants hardly offer any unusual food anymore everything tastes the same aida has a lot to do it was always nice to see and discover new places however the way guests are handled on site suggests more of a mass event as aida also charges high prices for excursions bicycle tour with aida local provider same bicycle directly on site and entry to the nature park together aida lost us for a long time after cruises travel period
the aidanova is a beautiful cruise ship great people work there very friendly and their work is greatly appreciated
all around well organised cruise with a very good team some excursions could be optimised
great trip perfect planning very good organization by aida very friendly crew
great destinations
very nice cruise on the fully occupied aidacosma to our complete satisfaction definitely recommended
it was another fantastic trip with aidaperla very well organized and carried out by aida with everything that goes with it our expectations were fulfilled again wed be happy to do it again
we decided to travel with the stella at very short notice the route was so interesting getting to know the canary islands but only eating in a buffet restaurant thats probably annoying but we were pleasantly surprised it was very relaxed and the food was delicious the arrival and departure went very well we immediately felt like we were in good hands the staff were always friendly and helpful both in the restaurants and at the bars the excursions were quite expensive but the tour guide was from the island and was able to give us good information we got a good impression of each island however it wasnt enough for us to find the one island we wanted to stay on for longer so we decided to go on a second cruise with aida around the canary islands
a good mix of relaxation and adventure
from the moment we arrived we were in a holiday mood we were greeted by cheerful staff our suitcases were transported from the plane to the cabin without this service i couldnt go on a holiday like this as i can no longer lift a suitcase it was easy to find your way around the relatively small ship the show elements and the artists in the show were phenomenally good i felt comfortable and at home thanks to the always friendly staff
that it was the first cruise and was mostly a positive experience
great ship great crew great route very entertaining always somewhere different
we have been on a cruise ship several times since we hadnt found the right flight for this trip we wanted to try aida there were some things that were better and some that were worse we wouldnt completely rule out taking another trip with aida
everything went really well from arrival to departure nova is simply a beautiful ship you step on board and immediately feel like you have arrived
it was a very nice trip the whole crew was super friendly and committed
it was still a nice trip
everything was wonderful aida perla
it was a successful trip with the aida prima
great organization great routes very friendly and always helpful service staff good choice of cabins and good room service
travelling in different waters always with aida prima stella and luna
wonderful holiday i can only recommend it
the journey was also booked through aida and everything went wonderfully arrival checkin departure and return flight and of course the entire stay on the aidacosma we were given a very friendly welcome at the airport and on the ship boarding was problemfree the suitcases were in front of the room door a short time later everything was great and relaxed thank you wed be happy to come back
the route with aidaprima journey fromto dubai was very good and informative arrival and departure via the package went well excursions were well organized but a bit overpriced lay times for the trip were good organization via aida was again good
it was once again a great vacation
with aida everyone can find the right vacation for them some people like it quieter and will find it on the sphinx class others like parties for them the others such as the beach club cube and d are the right choice all in all these ships are designed in such a way that those seeking peace and quiet and party types dont have to get in each others way in the evening so the complainers should think more about it if i want to have a nice chat with friends i go to a quiet bar in the evening you can find them everywhere with these conditions i certainly wouldnt sit next to the live band in the beach club and get artificially annoyed that the music is too loud so my recommendation for every type of vacationer
intensive support before and during the trip with constant advice so that questions are often clarified in advance
very good organization of arrival and departure as well as on board repetition of important information before the start of the trip very good service on board good and varied entertainment
travel and entertainment is always worth a trip thank you aida
aida is vacation relaxing enjoying and simply letting your soul unwind
mr maduka room service did an amazing job and exceeded our expectations the cruise was amazing but the entire staff really made our vacation unforgettable
a vacation with aida is simply breathtaking individual delicate simply excellent simply aida
we had a lovely trip with aidanova nice crew delicious food and a beautiful ship well be back
allround successful trip at an attractive price
organize a relaxing vacation
awesome captain the whole crew was like a big family it was my first cruise and they really picked me up the next cruise with aida is already being planned thank you aidacosma family
the aida trip was very well organized and everything went smoothly without stress or obstacles
it was my first cruise and im thrilled great excursions are offered the program on the ship is huge theres something for everyone the service on board is excellent the staff are all very friendly and helpful the food in the restaurants is delicious all in all a great cruise ill definitely be back
aida is still great but the food and drink in the buffet restaurants has been scaled down considerably over the years entertainment used to be brilliant but there are hardly any great musicals like there used to be the excursions have become too expensive you can book them externally for cheaper or take a taxi the drinks package is far too expensive as is the internet package unfortunately the departure airport in barbados was a disaster it was packed with people in a small hall the processing there was also catastrophic id rather not go there anymore
very well organized cruise with many excursion options
the first cruise met expectations well organized smooth sailing polite friendly and attentive staff relaxing vacation
the trip was cancelled by the tour operator we were not given a reason in the cancellation email however we were still charged the travel insurance that is just shabby now we are left with nothing but a booked annual holiday and less in our account thank you for ruining our honeymoon aida i will never book with you again
the trip was an experience from the first to the last day completely satisfied it was my first cruise and i have already booked the next one on the ship
it was a beautiful trip on a lovely boat but unfortunately making a profit is paramount drinks package does not apply to everything so if you order other wine you will be charged for packages but liqueur glass everything is super clean and specialty restaurants are top notch i may be very critical with my but i did this trip in the past with aida and it was a birthday gift for her th birthday and the first trip was great
all in all it is a great holiday with aida we have been to the caribbean twice now and had a great time
im always happy to go on a cruise if the priceperformance ratio is right
combination of sociable relaxed throughout the entire trip without boredom with the best service of excellent food and drinks the pool bar was the highlight of the ship for everyone involved
nice holiday unfortunately a bit expensive
a very organized company the return journey was particularly well organized at the airport the organization was very good everywhere
dream destinations and almost only great weather what more could you want
this was the second time we traveled with aida the first time with our kids aged and the main focus for us was the offer for the little ones we were not disappointed pool area slides climbing hall everything was great we had a great week and can recommend aidas offer without reservation
our caribbean trip on the quotlunaquot was fantastic the service on board was excellent overall the excursions were very well organized the entertainment could be improved the arrival and departure were very well organized the selection and quality of the food was good all of the staff were very friendly and helpful we were bothered by the fact that there were far too few seats at the bars outside everything was full of loungers but most of them were only occupied by towels rather than people more germanspeaking guides or audio translation systems should be used on the excursions this was also the wish of many fellow travelers
nice cruise
always worth a trip
i was on the aidastella from january th to st on the canary islands tour with madeira except for a small change in the trip because there was a storm on madeira it was just wonderful to degrees every day i went on excursions on every island either booked through aida or individually arranged and got to know the beauty of each individual island it was my first time there so i tried to absorb everything but at some point you cant get any more information into your head aidastella was also very great smaller ship than on my last trip but no less beautiful i have to thank the waiters and bartenders at the beach bar who pampered me all around and brought me my drinks sometimes even without me having to say anything i would also like to thank the staff at the aida bar there too i was treated wonderfully and courteously always greeted with a smile which i was always happy to return the cabin was always clean and tidy thanks to the room service and i slept like a baby because the beds were so comfortable thanks to the whole crew for making my vacation so wonderful im happy to come back and will definitely come back see you on aida
great cruise with superbly organized excursions good service and good food staff super friendly and always helpful great guides would love to go again
a great caribbean cruise good food the ship is clean and well maintained always nice to travel with aida you see a new place every day and are pampered there is no stress and you dont have to worry about anything just enjoy
thank you for a wonderful holiday
a very well equipped ship friendly staff good service definitely use the wellness oasis definitely visit the mama mia restaurant all in all a great relaxing holiday
always happy to travel with aida unfortunately the excursion prices are a bit overpriced but you can get them cheaper from thirdparty providers great entertainment something for everyone
great experience a perfectly organized holiday thanks to aida
we are comfortable with getting to know more places in one vacation as well as safe and excellent service
aida has a good reputation among german guests as very few of them have the confidence to use other international shipping companies in terms of foreign languages meaning that around of guests are germans of all ages
as soon as we entered the cabin and went out onto our balcony we felt relaxed and unwind we were quickly able to leave the stress of everyday life behind us and enjoy ourselves day after day simply pure relaxation
the entire concept of the trip is very well coordinated and organized there is no chance of getting bored
the partial world tour was a complete success for us the crew took great care of the guests and made several additional highlights possible such as pitcairn
after our th aida cruise we would like to travel with aida again we already have plans for next year
a nice relaxing trip
aida is unique the sphinx class are the most beautiful ships at sea the priceperformance ratio is very good the drinks included in the buffet restaurants set aida apart from the competition and are a clear decision criterion
my first cruise first time traveling alone caribbean and mexico aida was actually second choice but the alternatives didnt work out on time outbound flight was very punctual and pleasant return flight was bad mainly because of completely incompetenthelpless ground staff in la romana excursions only partly recommendable all overpriced practically no german speakers guides in chichen itz i had the local guide explain everything to me in spanish which was easier to understand than the germanspeaking tour one of out of in german the actual cruise was very pleasant if you have realistic expectations the food was ok but of course not stars for gt guests entertainment was discolike music extremely loud almost all of our selfarranged trips over the last years were bettermore interesting than almost all aida shore excursions with exceptions it is better to arrange and book everything yourself ensure you return on time overall if you just want a cruise cocktails and party on board good discoveringgetting to know new things needs improvement to be fair some of the annoyances are at the expense of conceited egocentric and undisciplined guests
very good trip
great value for money high quality lots of options for spending your holiday for guests of all ages also possible for physically handicapped guests as there is plenty of accessibility an ai hotel holiday can only compete to a limited extent here
very nice trip will remember it for a long time
i have traveled with aida times a year for the last years times in total so far the first cruise was in unfortunately the priceperformance ratio is getting worse and worse less and less is included and the quality of the food is gradually being cut back for example even something as small as the ice cream in the past there was delicious lagnese ice cream and now its schlemmerland ice cream its definitely an own brand but unfortunately of much poorer quality there are no more free water bottles with premium bookings no social media flat rate with allinclusive and and and i hope aida doesnt lose its loyal regular passengers because at some point the cruise boom will be over and the regular passengers will then possibly be on the msc however it must be said that the crew is great as always and the big plus with aida
i was generally satisfied with the trip but the excursions were not justified in terms of value for money the excursions were too overpriced it should also be important to aida that the tour operator of the excursions guarantees that the vehicles are roadworthy driving a jeep into the rainforest that has a bare tread is a danger for vacationers and an accident on departure from the port would also get aida into trouble my thanks go to the great crew the crew and travelers were like one big family
very nice trip very friendly very clean and not boring every day was unforgettable thank you for that
everyone should go on a cruise see many countries always discover something new thats life
unfortunately it is no longer the aida of the past many of the offers we loved have been dropped the savings potential increases with each trip we will switch more to quotmein schiffquot in the future
cruise experience
great service friendly staff and simply a wonderful holiday with great destinations and excursions
we have been travelling with aida for at least years now and this trip aidacosma january canaries was really great too what is quotnewquot and you should know is that the selection of drinks on decks has been greatly reduced and only selected drinks are available there so if you want your favourite cocktail you now have to take the elevator decks down pick up your drink then go back up decks to enjoy it there i really dont know who came up with this nonsense at aida if all drinks are available at the bars like before it will be worth again
the caribbean cruise was an allround great trip the travel organization by aida the ship staff as well as food and drinks were all great there is nothing to complain about aidas sustainability and environmental awareness are remarkable i would go again anytime many thanks to everyone involved at aida for the great experience
traveled with the nova in scandinavia everything was excellent
nice vacation only the aida perla doesnt belong in the caribbean this ship is better for the northern tours
i have been travelling with aida since but this time it was different the service at the bars is anything but good the buffet restaurants were incredibly full in the morning no matter what time breakfast was and finding a table was no fun thats why we always ate in a special restaurant in the evening which was always very quiet and nice i think the ship was completely full and it is a masterpiece to organise that but i would prefer a smaller ship next time because it just felt like mass processing the destinations were really beautiful though and that in winter with deep snow
if you ignore the fact that you always have to understand how everything works at the beginning it was an incredible experience every member of staff managed to give us an unforgettable holiday we will stay with aida and will hire them again
this is the third time i have been on a cruise with aida and as always i cant complain everything was just great im already looking forward to the next cruise
very nice cruise towards norwaydenmark we never expected how beautiful a cruise could be
my first cruise was a complete success i will try it again in the high season and if the crowds dont put me off i will have found a new way to travel that i will pursue aida really has a strong program on offer for a fair price
a very nice trip with the aida nova great ship and super friendly crew there was nothing to complain about
completely organized from arrival to departure no long waiting times there is always something to do on the ship if you want many excursions are offered a fantastic entertainment program there really is something for everyone
great trip something for every age
all in all a great holiday the canary islands in winter are always a good option the weather is great we ate very well and saw a lot
for us there is no better holiday than with aida
overall a wellrounded relaxing holiday
it was a very interesting trip on which we were able to learn a lot of new things as well as the winter in scandinavia unfortunately a lot has changed on aida ships in the last two years and not always for the better above all the priceperformance ratio for the stay on board is no longer right
aida is no longer what it used to be my first cruise with aida was in a dream since then on five more trips it has gotten worse and worse too anonymous no charm worse service the ship much too big etc since the sale to the americans aida has lost its charm the organization is perfect as always
very nice trip with the aida cosma we were completely satisfied with our weeklong trip to the canary islands
great vacation it was our first cruise wed love to go again
to meet lots of interesting people and share experiences to enjoy good food to talk to nice people to enjoy the entertainment and to go dancing with likeminded people
aida is the best ship in the entire fleet
it was my first trip with aida and certainly not the last we are very happy with my daughter and we really enjoyed it the service was friendly and the staff were very helpful and everything was perfect
the trip in general interesting countriesvery good weather
we spent another lovely week on aida nova a huge thank you to aida and the entire aida nova crew
the surroundings the atmosphere on the ships many good experiences
overall a lovely caribbean trip although aida has raised its prices considerably the catalogue prices still seem reasonable but everything else has to be paid for separately aida makes a lot of money especially from the expensive excursions
the trip is highly recommended everything went really well arrival and departure we discovered lots of new cities and the weather was also very good the facilities on the ship are very good
a great vacation with great destinations and a great crew thank you for a great days on board aidaprima
unfortunately aida is no longer like it was before corona but it is still a great opportunity to discover new countries even if only briefly and to come into contact with many people the cost pressure is not leaving aida unscathed either and you can unfortunately notice that especially in the catering industry nevertheless it is always worth a trip if you know what you are getting into
germanspeaking tour guides on the excursions
we were on the aida from january th to th and took part in the orient tour this was our second aida tour before that we were on the aida blue in the summer of since we were so satisfied with the offer we decided to go a second time unfortunately this trip will be the last cruise with the aida our decision depends on your customer base we are german citizens with a migration background this can also be seen in our skin and hair color otherwise however the migration background is neither apparent in our language native german partly born in germany nor in our clothing style no headscarf no burka open european clothing style unfortunately however we felt very very uncomfortable on the ship due to looks sometimes racist and insulting comments intimidating looks towards the children finally i would like to mention that the aida crew was great but we got the impression that the aida clientele wanted a trip exclusively for and with quotgerman clientelequot thats why we decided against another aida trip
it was another great cruise with aida on the stella thank you for that special thanks go to the entertainment and especially the abba show
great experiences simply a great holiday feeling
to say it up front there was nothing to complain about there were four of us and we were treated in a friendly manner from start to finish it started with checking in and we learned a lot from aida the excursions were superbly organized and had very good tour guides this trip will be remembered in a positive way
our new years eve trip with aida perla in the caribbean was great as expected the service the food the program etc left little to be desired however we noticed noticeable cuts in the suite benefits which actually no longer justify the high price level no more use of the spa area on departure and arrival days no more real late checkout no more champagne in the lounge completely overcrowded patio deck etc another major criticism is that only englishspeaking agencies were hired for the excursions that was different years ago the range of excursions itself was also poor we have already done the trip for the rd time and in some cases no longer found any interesting excursions although the islands have a lot to offer a big compliment as always to the housekeeping jason on deck was simply incredible necessary repairs were taken care of quickly and special requests were quickly fulfilled however we asked ourselves why it is still not possible to get stable internet in the cabins in to log in we had to make a pilgrimage from our cabin at the stern of the ship to the nearest elevatorit sometimes took forever to log in regardless of whether you had the latest iphone or an old one there has to be a better way especially since you pay a huge amount for it all in all a nice trip although we are now critical of the priceperformance ratio and will soon take a look at the competition
a week of sun in winter always happy to travel with aida even though the ships are unfortunately getting bigger these days you can still find a place to relax the very good entertainment program also contributes to relaxation not to mention the food and drink
great ship with activities for young and old great food and delicious cocktails friendly captain and great crew vario cabin was pure luxury canary islands in winter are a clear recommendation
once again a great cruise and it is still fun to drive aida
we have been traveling with aida for over years and have consistently had good to very good experiences this years trip also brought us relaxation many nice and interesting encounters good food and great weather we were able to get to know new destinations people and countriesislands comfortably and safely
we were traveling with a whole group on the aida prima it was a fantastic vacation experience the ships facilities and the crew more than met our expectations we would do a trip like this again at any time
the holiday was awesome
its always nice to come home on aida
trip was good unfortunately services were cut social media flat rate without prior notice zero goodwill very annoyed beforehand but the trip was nice eventful and relaxing but otherwise over the years it was a rather minimalist program that wasnt particularly loving shows were the same as on the summer vacation on a different route and on a different ship all in all though the priceperformance ratio was just about ok
we traveled with aida three times the last time was from december th to january th with the perla i can only report positive things the entire staff was very friendly and always tried very hard to please the holidaymakers the food was great you have to remember that the kitchen has to prepare food for almost people but it was really great the arrival and departure were also very well organized and we never had to wait long if you book a trip with aida you have to expect that it will be fully booked you know in advance what you are booking i cant understand some of the negative reviews here but everyone sees it differently you cant please everyone
i have already spent my holidays on aida times every year it gets better and better our next vacation will only be on aida thanks to all the staff everything was great
our first cruise everything was perfect there is nothing more to say
it was supposed to be our honeymoon and something very special and unforgettable unfortunately we were so disappointed by aida on this trip that we are seriously considering whether we want to travel the seas with aida again
an allround great experience great excursions food and drinks also top notch we will definitely travel with aida again
it is a vacation from the moment the ship sets sail until the journey is unfortunately over
relaxed and friendly atmosphere the orient route is amazing highly recommended some shore excursions are poorly organized and all overpriced
we were on the canary islands trip from january th to th we liked everything about madeira apart from a few minor things
for me the best way to travel holidays and trips aida almost always delivers special moments unfortunately i have to admit to my shame that you compare the trips in your head really unfortunately each one was great in its own right but unfortunately you quickly get used to this high standard how arrogant of me
everything went well and it was a lovely trip with the aida cosma
great orient trip enough time at the state parliaments getting to know the cities possibility to start the trip on foot great weather mega shows
travel with aida again and again
the cleanliness the perfect overall organization of all the excursions including the check in and check out of all these people really fascinated me
my husband and i were happy in every way to have spent such a holiday the team and staff carried out every type of activity with a friendly demeanor warmth hard work and outstanding communication we hope that you all stay healthy
experience the sea see other countries and meet nice people
aida nova is a very large and beautiful ship we were very happy with our vacation on aida
the trip with the aida was very nice unfortunately overcrowded with children using the pool was hardly possible or not possible at all
simply very relaxing and a great service in every respect aida is highly recommended
good food and good entertainment relaxation and adventure
great atmosphere on board very nice and wellorganized excursions overall a great vacation great selection of food in the restaurants on board overall very good food and good service
even in bad times everyone should keep smiling after all it is a holiday for every guest
travel and accommodation new experience a beautiful komi
very great holiday great ports was the first time in the arab countries very great crew
another great holiday although the excursions have become very expensive
simply a lovely and relaxing time on the aidanova despite the storm and a bit of swell very friendly crew for us always a lovely memory and always an experience thats why we always choose aida
i was a total aida fan and i really enjoyed the southeast asia trip with aidabella apart from the missed trip to the world heritage site in macao china through aida or better still the stiffness of the reception the travel information for selfdiscoverers was rather poor or nonexistent in contrast to my previous trips with aida what a pity
perfect itinerary friendly staff festive atmosphere
super nice committed polite and courteous staff good organization of the entire trip
ship nice excursions okay
christmas and new years eve at sea far away from family that is certainly a challenge for everyone it was definitely mastered here great christmas gala with a speech from the captain there was not a dry eye in the room new years eve in hong kong with a fantastic berth it couldnt have been better despite bad weather and the cancelled port an alternative port was found and we were allowed to call at brunei and as always good food you can see it on the scales lots of experiences in beautiful places nice people great service yes with such a logistical challenge things can go wrong sometimes and there are people who always have something to complain about we think thats a shame because everyone here really makes an effort so that we can all enjoy our vacation a big thank you to everyone who contributed to such a wonderful vacation
great ship with lots of possibilities unfortunately a bit too chaotic otherwise it was nice
sailing on aida is always an experience all employees usually do their best due to bad weather a port had to be cancelled even here a replacement was quickly found and we were able to travel to brunei excursions were also quickly organised even if it was new territory for the crew forms had to be filled out etc even here an agreement was reached with the authorities it was all a logistical challenge that the crew mastered very well we will definitely sail on aida again
well organized trip friendly professional staff
as always a great trip this is the th time ive been there theres room for improvement of course
it was a unique cruise with unique ports and great experiences
nice holiday tailored to germans shows and party in the evening
hello we have already been on four cruises but this was our first and last with aida i dont know how you can reward smiling employees when of the employees cant smile maybe you should concentrate on them to remedy the situation
rating from past trips including the last one in dec
stars because it was quite a nice cruise with the family
relaxing travel lots of new things to discover and the hotel always in the harbor
the vacation really begins when you get on the ship the staff are super friendly and helpful
we met very nice people took part in exciting excursions we enjoyed the time thanks to everyone who spoiled us
dubai simply another world
once again a lovely trip with aida just never again in an inside cabin it was very noisy
its a unique concept we are very grateful to have discovered aida for ourselves from start to finish you have the feeling of being pampered and on holiday we were able to see so much through aida our lives wouldnt be long enough if we had done it individually keep it up amazing
very nice trip to denmark and norway
great destinations the port selection was very good
first cruise very nice
the trips with aida used to be better the quality of the fellow travelers has dropped significantly the excursions used to be cheaper sunbeds were still reserved in the morning without most of them being used something should be done about this you could see the dissatisfaction of the frequent travelers we were also very dissatisfied
holiday to relax everyone helpful and courteous
overall a great trip
aida where employees are friends to their guests
the entire trip was relaxed and pleasant
we have traveled with aida many times and this was our worst tour the ship was too full you could no longer make reservations in the restaurants not even in advance the service staff were overwhelmed and could hardly look after the guests overall it was a bad service for a lot of money
aidaperla was very pleasant
the trip on board the aida prima was really great the booked arrivaldeparture package was not ok at all the price and performance were completely out of proportion we were quotforcedquot to rebook from a booked direct flight with condor to a flight with a stopover in istanbul with pegasus according to aida it is a wellknown airline we cannot confirm this statement it is a classic lowcost airline which even there is one of the worse ones and aida offered no support with seat reservations booking more luggage etc this experience spoiled the joy of the vacation
super beautiful kussmund ships and we always enjoy coming on board thank you very much for everything
it was just one great dream to be on the aidacosma
as always it was very nice and relaxing a great route with beautiful cities
great experience with mostly pleasant guests great destinations and very friendly staff
it was our first time travelling with aida nova it was by far one of our worst holidays there was very little going on on board unfortunately the number of people was not suitable for the space you had to queue everywhere the restaurants were always overcrowded childcare was overcrowded all the seats were always taken at coffee and cake time there was a constant hustle and bustle on the ship and the days at sea were particularly bad the priceperformance ratio was not right its a shame that we had to have this experience with aida
a relaxing active fun varied holiday
i once again had an eventful trip with aidacosma
all in all a nice trip
very satisfied holiday
all good things come in threes this was our third and definitely last aida trip in four years we were on the aidanova over new years eve unfortunately nothing was really decorated for the festivities we had expected a lot more if you have allergiesintolerances its really hard to eat the food the children liked it so far but for us it was pure stress next time well go with a different shipping company
great cruise with aida over christmas and new year to the caribbean
aida is simply fun sail the seas and discover ports in a relaxed environment
great holiday
my experience on the cruise was simply fantastic from start to finish i felt like i was in another world surrounded by endless ocean and breathtaking views the staff on board were extremely friendly and attentive always ready to fulfill every wish the culinary experiences were a highlight from exquisite meals to relaxed snacks by the pool the variety of restaurants and bars ensured that there was something for every taste the entertainment options were varied and high quality whether it was live music theater performances or informative lectures boredom never arose the shore excursions offered were also well organized and enabled me to discover the most beautiful places along the itinerary the cabins were comfortable and offered breathtaking views of the sea the cleanliness on board was exemplary and the entire ship exuded elegance and coziness this cruise will stay in my memory for a long time and i can hardly wait for the next adventure on the high seas i can only warmly recommend a cruise to anyone looking for an unforgettable and relaxing break
the holiday feeling that is given to you
we are frequent travelers and have enjoyed every trip so far
aida is the holiday specialist for young people for families for older people and for solo travellers
great ship new years eve off madeira perfect position of the ship for viewing fireworks off funchal
we have been traveling with aida for years if we didnt like it we wouldnt do it
we were completely satisfied with our trip and will spend another holiday with aida
aida makes a dream vacation possible
great weather best time to travel the only downside to the ship was the view from the fitness area the food in the ai restaurants was generally topnotch with the exception of fish dishes all drinks were at the right temperature and well mixed service and cleanliness were very good great show program great live band and djs
the service and the friendliness it was once again a wonderful holiday that we were able to enjoy so much
seeing something new every day without having to worry about the everyday things very relaxing
all in all a great tour with impressive fireworks in front of funchal
we had a wonderful trip for the third time
aida offers many holidaymakerscruisers an attractive holiday with many options the costs of the wellness area should be reconsidered but not abolished
longer time on excursions to see everything
we spent a week in the canaries and madeira in december we had a great veranda cabin lovely excursions star food nice staff everything was top notch check in and check out were very well organized it was my first big ship but i was pleasantly surprised you always got a lounger towel reservations are everywhere i can recommend it without reservation
aidaprima another very nice trip food drink activities excursions ports service arrival and departure in short everything was perfect thank you very much we were not disappointed and can only recommend aida full stars deserved
good travel
great trip very good quality of food and drinks at least on the smaller ships hotline needs improvement trips great experiences
we spent weeks on a great trip on the aida diva however there are a few points that need to be criticized a pool shower and the clock at the pool were not repaired at the bar it took ages to get a drink because you had to ask a waiter to order the food in the individual restaurants was monotonous and repeated a lot the staff were very nice but overwhelmed organizing the departure was also impossible its a shame it could have been better
all in all a lovely caribbean trip with aidaperla accompanied by small and larger annoyances such as the ship being too big the pool area being far too small small whirlpools with glass panes deck supposed to be infinity pools the aida app on board only works to a limited extent poor information regarding the drinks package positive aida embarkation and disembarkation as well as shore excursions were perfectly organised no waiting times at all overall the staff were top
aida is designed for mass processing the individual is not taken into account there is a first come first served mentality which is supported by the conditions on board there is too little of everything for the number of passengers too few places in restaurants too few loungers by the pool too few available entertainment options too few seats for the evening program and so on our promised route was also not kept if you want to eat and drink as much as possible you can do it if you are looking for relaxation or are looking forward to a nice family vacation you can forget it it is rather stressful as you are constantly looking for seats free appointments etc it is stressful
first cruise sufficient help for newbies helpful staff general atmosphere very relaxed and quotsuitable for vacationquot nice excursions by bus and ebike customers over christmas unfortunately super selfish and unbeatable in stupidity
aida is not an allround carefree package the ship is beautiful there is lots to discover the crew and staff are always very nice and friendly but i was annoyed by all the additional costs on our cruise in the caribbean that does not contribute to relaxation and holiday enjoyment the two of us had booked an aida drinks package light which means nonalcoholic drinks coffee milkshakes however that does not include for example tonic water this or that etc but is tonic water alcoholic no we paid euros for the weeks beforehand and often felt like third class citizens drinking in the evenings at bars and on the upper deck it is very warm in the caribbean as you know and i want to be able to drink water at all times even in my cabin otherwise there was no water at night or when i went ashore i always bought it and paid euros per bottle im demanding the cost of one of our drinks packages back which was euros as we never drank it twice the aida excursions are also all overpriced you dont need to book in advance for the caribbean route you can get everything done on site the locals are there and offer the same or sometimes nicer tours for much less money otherwise the caribbean route wasnt great at the beginning with the first island of st vincent its probably a cheap port berth it then steadily improved and the abc islands under the trade winds as well as antigua and grenada are really beautiful and have these great bright dream beaches great people and lovely excursion destinations on the islands do it look around and then give your conclusions
first cruise everything was good great weather
our second cruise with aida even though we didnt stop in copenhagen everything was explained why
i have already taken a cruise with my wife through the caribbean with aidaperla everything was great now i wanted to book the cruise through thailand malaysia and singapore as a solo traveler i couldnt believe my eyes when i realized that the price for a solo traveler was just euros cheaper than for two people to euros for me thats a complete ripoff and i will never take another cruise with aida
we expected an international cruise however it turned out that we were in a part of germany literally everything was german language decor entertainment culture etc only when you disembarked did you find yourself in spain canary islands cruise the allinclusive concept was also special sometimes i could get a glass of wine sometimes i had to pay euros all prices on the boat are extremely high
a floating super hotel and constantly exploring other places and collecting new impressions
i was really looking forward to my very first christmas trip and was sooooo disappointed
relaxed holiday for the whole family
too short layover time in curacao bonaire and grenada
we took two perfect trips with aida this year the organization and the friendliness of the staff was exemplary many thanks to the aida team
it was a very very nice vacation
had a great cruise affordable beautiful excursions nice people helpful and friendly staff recommended
we were able to spend the christmas holidays relaxing together with the family
very nice holiday exceeded everything once with aida always with aida
beautiful relaxed contented cruise for young and old we would do it again and again
everything is beautiful as always unfortunately too short
we had the orient trip and were very satisfied
we family with children did the canary islands tour in december veranda cabin on the twelfth level at the stern cleantidy lots of bars tasty cocktails large selection of drinks food in the restaurants stars out of the onboard staff polite courteous eager to serve we cant think of anything we could complain about in terms of the cruise and had exciting experiences on board and mostly nice fellow passengers we were planning to book a trip with a suite soon but it seems somehow uncomfortable cold atmosphere the suites are somehow uncomfortable harbor entrances are particularly worth seeing aidacosma and aidanova almost identical chic vacation experience
the first cruise and definitely not the last
very well organized trip friendly and extremely helpful staff
so far each of our aida trips has been a great experience very good service very beautiful destinations great restaurants with very good food at level very good selection of shore excursions
very good food and lots of relaxation very nice harbors and good location
trip was cancelled
a relaxing christmas holiday with food drinks activities and school
the christmas trip was relaxing and good the crew was top the only thing was the quotflimsyquot cancellation from copenhagen
a great diverse range of travel options
the aida concept is simply very well thought out the team works hard and comes up with lots of great ideas unfortunately some of it wasnt for our son so the holiday got boring after a few days but thats a personal thing were also more of adventure holidaymakers and like to go hiking so the two days in oslo were perfect i think you have to go on a cruise more often to really enjoy it theres a lot we didnt know at the beginning and we missed out on so many offers in the first few days
satisfaction and organization of the entire trip
everything is really well organized at aida you just have to pay for the flights yourself which is really not ok for the expensive flights booked through aida the excursion packages arent exactly cheap either the food is good in the buffet restaurants but not hot that changes suddenly when you go to the a la carte restaurants where the food is excellent the cabins are very nice and clean the entertainment on board is soso which of course everyone perceives differently otherwise the aidacosma is a very nice ship but we personally prefer the smaller ships because the staff there have more time for you
it is always nice to travel around the canary islands and compare one island after the other on our own tour we always discover new and interesting sights
i was pleasantly surprised because it was my first cruise the logistics and organization that went into it fascinated me
great trip no complaints
we enjoy our trips on cruise ships to the fullest unfortunately the prices have risen quite a bit nevertheless we will travel with aida again in the future
great experience with lots of highs and lows the aidacosma is great but also very big the food the staff and the entertainment are good you get your moneys worth here however the number of people takes some getting used to the arrival and departure lags miles behind the ship and is not that exciting the sundair company is a joke all in all we had a good holiday with aida
aida is always worth a trip this trip to the canary islands and madeira was also beautiful
a lovely holiday with lots of new impressions of the country and its people
a great trip to the caribbean with aida from we went on a great caribbean trip with aida the service was very good we will definitely do one or two more tours with aida
great trip good staff great ship
to explore several countriescities in a short period of time
great clean cabins motivated staff high quality food with a wide selection just like aida for us its pure relaxation if you dont eat out during peak times even on the big perla you can always find a quieter place somewhere if youre flexible and looking for something for us its been the best time of the year for years thanks to a great crew you immediately feel at home
a very rich varied and productive trip
our trip with aida was well organized the staff on board were polite and helpful i felt very comfortable and got what i expected thank you
always nice to take a sea voyage
all in all a wonderful cruise with a few minor drawbacks from many guests
it was the th trip with aida and as always it was great even though the smaller ships were more comfortable for me aida remains my cruise operator
aida is and remains the best cruise operator for me
only aida manages to give me such a great holiday feeling
once again we were satisfied with our cruise
travelling with aida is always an experience unfortunately the professionalism of the staff is declining more and more
aida is very high quality travel at reasonable prices
all in all a successful cruise very good service all in all we were completely satisfied with aida
aida is a good cruise operator the food and service in the restaurants is very good in contrast to the included table wines the excursions offered are very well organized but also very expensive there are a lot of days at sea and the selection of islands visited could be better
we had a wonderful trip
a successful vacation
super relaxing
overall beautiful places worth seeing in the caribbean and central america sometimes a little too little time on shore excursions the ship has a great fitness center and wellness area the service on the ship is attentive and cleanliness is noticeable free food wine and water overall of lesser quality and not satisfactory
overall i was happy with the vacation
the trip with aida was unique and has become a permanent part of our memories we would love to come back
my first vacation on a ship and my expectations were exceeded friendly cheerful staff and everything went like clockwork from arrival checkin accommodation entertainment culinary delights excursions etc to the journey home thanks to the crew of the aidacosma it was great with you
overall a very nice trip to asia with shore excursions and culture the priceperformance ratio has gone down at aida the ship aidabella is a bit old the focus on service should be brought back to the forefront
we had a very nice trip
great vacation
the aidanova is a great ship the mass of tourists is not everyones cup of tea the staff is friendly and helpful the concept and destinations are right
everything went really well it was a fantastic trip i will be travelling with aida more often from now on
new experiences were had with the countries visited food country and people were discovered the goal of the trip was achieved although due to the climate it will probably not be repeated
it was our first cruise but i can say it wont be the last the aida nova makes dreams come true the time on board flew by
super organized this is how you can enjoy your vacation
everything was very well organized and we were very satisfied it was the ideal vacation for us you are well looked after
super relaxation great trip would love to go again
i felt good waking up somewhere different every day was wonderful the journey there and back by plane and train is no fun but thats not aidas fault
a great trip with great experiences and impressions
it was a lovely holiday good food and well organised excursions
anyone who loves ships will like aida sun joy and sea relaxation socializing and new things foreign cities and a different flair anyone who starts with this will long for more
for us aida is a world of experience every time we travel the excitement and experiences are always a great success the cabin and the food are great and the service is also great a big thank you to the crew
very nice trip
the cruise was wonderful the ship the service the drinks everything was great
traveling with aida for the th time very satisfied again
good relaxation good excursions good food good entertainment on board a successful holiday
very reputable i felt very comfortable and safe on all my trips
aida nova is a ship for families with children
i went on a trip with aida years ago this years trip didnt even come close basically everyone tries hard the staff is first class the food in the buffet restaurants has gone downhill but theres something for everyone the entertainment is unfortunately a disaster it used to be much better but basically i would travel with aida again
it was my third trip and i felt that the quotsmaller shipsquot were much more comfortable this may be a subjective opinion but i personally wouldnt want to travel on the nova again
everything went well i can recommend this trip and the ship
it was a very nice trip with a wellchosen route the service on board was impressive and minor problems were resolved immediately prices for many excursions seem unreasonably high and you can quickly fall into a trap with the choice of cabin that is something you should think about
edmar gaitan gave us a very warm welcome a warm person with a lot of love he enriched our vacation thank you aida for this wonderful person he served us every day on the aida nova
very good concept rest activities excursions as well as relaxation and culinary delights are implemented in a lovingly christmasdecorated environment with a family atmosphere by friendly staff
a luxury hotel with everything your heart desires sometimes the pools were overcrowded
you immediately feel at home and in holiday mode
the routes are good and the cabins are very functional
experience with the aida blu seychelles cruise days the trip itself was very beautiful especially mauritius and seychelles are worth it unfortunately this is where the positives of this cuise end although aida offers their trips in many countries there is no question of an international organization please note that if you book this cruise you will be at the mercy of the german language all documents on board and information are in german the app has an english speech option but all information here is in german only all speech during shows is in german the music is largely german when an important announcement is made on the onboard intercom only german is spoken despite our reasonable command of german a lot of information passed through us which caused a lot of stress and annoyance all inclusive the restaurant opening hours are far too limited for a cruise and close too early the food is also very limited and the same every day if you expect the luxury of the hal or msc you will be disappointed while most companies fill in your documents during the trip at aida you will have to process a flood of forms during the cruise and yes also in german the excursions are far too expensive and we recommend booking them on shore after years of cruise experience the luxurious feeling has completely disappeared on the aida blu we therefore advise against this company never again aida for us
the caribbean has always been a dream that has now come true
many thanks to the holiday fleet it was very well organised again this time we went around the canary islands including madeira with a full days shore leave on each of the islands
like the other four holidays with aida it was again a wonderful and unforgettable holiday
the trips with aida are always very nice we were on the aidacosma a very large ship with lots of entertainment unfortunately i also have to complain that the music in the shows and the disco is much too loud or rather for us we had a veranda cabin on deck below the beach club the events started at pm the music was so loud especially the bass tones that even with the veranda door closed it was impossible to open the veranda door and that happened every day its a shame we would have liked to have known beforehand then we would have booked a different cabin and not on deck middle
we went on a canary islands tour with stella and enjoyed the days the quality of the excursions varies greatly of course this also depends on the commitment of the tour guide some of the excursions offered are very expensive for what is offered the buffet restaurants are quotoverrunquot when they open if you have time go later there is always something and you dont have to go to bed hungry the staff were friendly helpful and almost always had a smile on their faces we enjoyed not having to constantly pack our suitcases in order to be able to see several stops
a beautiful trip the ship offers a lot unfortunately it is too built up
everything was well organized the trip met our expectations
it was beautiful relaxing and we visited very nice christmas markets
best vacation of my life
nice trip very friendly staff you feel well looked after
unfortunately the ship aidaprima ex dubai was extremely fully booked and the stress was noticeable among the guests and crew the mood occasionally changed on three days out of a total of seven days on board there were arrivals and departures which caused great unrest there was hardly a holiday feeling
nice cruise and very well organized
for us aida is the perfect vacation whether you want to laze around feast swim listen to good music watch shows get to know new people cities and countries everything is possible you dont have to worry about anything and you can just live for the day read the information briefly every day and you can easily decide what you want to do
after various cruises with different providers we have chosen aida cruises as our favorite travel company everything is just right here from the price to the service and the ships are like our favorite floating hotels
aida diva caribbean island and mexico there is absolutely no entertainment on the ship no music or other entertainment suggestions for improvement are laughed at and not taken seriously we couldnt visit the cayman islands because of the waves so we drove on to jamaica only to find out that we couldnt dock there either planning was a complete waste of time im very disappointed that you get this for the first and last time
my first aida vacation but definitely not my last i am thrilled it is the perfect way to travel and aida has friendly crew every day every hour of the day of the passengers were also funny cheerful and friendly there is always a black sheep except with the aida crew
a great holiday on a very nice clean ship
the entire route was very nice for me and i enjoyed it very much since i now have to travel alone the trip is ideal for me because of the excellent service i will travel with aida again in the future
it was my first cruise i was pleasantly surprised by the many different things on offer during the trip this made it very varied
another great trip quality as always very good
in recent years the aida cruise concept has increasingly been aimed at younger guests parents with children teenagers and young adults who like things a little louder and more quotunconventionalquot are in good hands here anyone looking for peace relaxation and cultural enrichment on a cruise ship will no longer have it as easy with aida as it used to be
as always a nice sociable trip the aida excursions can still be worked on
first cruise great ship beautiful route nice staff
my first cruise was a positive experience services support and organization were perfect
discover the world with aida without packing your suitcase explore different travel destinations the same hotel just always somewhere different ie the usual service delicious food clean quotaccommodationquot
it was a great canary islands cruise on the aida stella thanks to the whole team
great trip on a beautiful ship where everything was perfect and we are normally convinced tui fans important for those who dont like the hustle and bustle you can avoid it wonderfully on the lanai deck here you will find everything you need to enjoy a wonderful and relaxing holiday the food was very good and there was a large selection with something for everyone the tastefully decorated restaurants and the entertainment were particularly noteworthy and we were never bored the crew was very friendly and helpful the only thing i would criticize was the lack of storage space in the cabins this was definitely not our last trip on the cosma
have a nice trip and good food another aida trip
it was a fantastic relaxing experience with many wonderful new moments for me personally thank you very much
no germanspeaking excursions unless one of aidas own tour guides felt like doing so throughout the entire trip and even on board
we feel in good hands on the aida ships
aida did everything right again on this trip and i felt very comfortable on board the staff were very helpful and anticipated my wishes i will be back in
aida simply amazing you have to experience it
after almost aida trips it was the most unpleasant trip so far in the french kiss we were looked after by sleepyheads so much so that i recommended that some of the waiters be assigned to the crew mess to serve i have the kiss level and when i talk to the officers if i want to complain about something i have to listen to you dont have to travel with us but trips in years are no coincidence and aida was also supported during the pandemic but that is no longer an issue with the current capacity utilisation the additional ports set up were no compensation for jordan petra we had not booked a tour of greece
an absolutely wonderful holiday from booking to the food the room deluxe veranda cabin to the excursionsshore excursions and the return flight everything was perfectly organized
once aida always aida i just miss the smaller ships like aidacara aidaaura etc
the aida ships are beautiful but the big ships for example are great everything is very loud there no relaxation to speak of
an allround wonderful holiday a complete pampering program
it was a very nice trip with great excursions
it is good to be asked directly after a trip everything is still present
a beautiful trip with beautiful experiences and ports
overall i was very happy with the aida vacation only on the return flight from frankfurt am main to berlin did we have to wait hours for our suitcases
aidabella was the very first cruise we have ever taken not only the route and the ship but also the crew and the atmosphere made this a dream vacation that will be an unforgettable experience although we had a somewhat turbulent return journey from bangkok because lufthansa cancelled our flight to munich the aida crew took care of everything so that we could go home so i would just like to say a big thank you for the wonderful vacation for the great schedule and for all the efforts of the crew and the crew on board once aida always aida
with the aida cruise you book an allround carefree package after exciting shore excursions you can relax on board a wide range of activities and relaxation are available
aida transit trips cannot be recommended the food is the same every day there is no variety in either the a la carte or buffet which becomes very monotonous on a day trip unfortunately the promised ports of call are often not visited but instead there are others that are less interesting aida can do this according to its terms and conditions and does so a trip to the orient turned into a trip to the mediterranean in cold weather in november unfortunately more and more untrained and young staff are being employed who have little understanding of the needs and problems of older people
the best thing is that you can see islands in days
always great atmosphere beautiful destinations friendly helpful staff
always great experiences and impressions on the trips
the trip had everything i expected action fun and entertainment
satisfaction and wellbeing throughout the entire journey
a great trip with many nice people and great impressions of the individual countriesislands
an honest but unfortunately too short only week cruise around the canary islands
great time and vacation on aida
our first cruise with aidacosma from mallorca to the canary islands tour was a complete success the inside cabin is smaller than on mein schiff but the location on deck was very quiet extensive food in the buffet restaurants and thanks to a special price months before departure we had the comfort deluxe drinks package which was very good service everywhere was very friendly everything was very clean we will definitely be back for the next travel deals
delicious food lots of choice especially fruit good entertainment the new italian singer is great lectures by lecturers were interesting booked excursions were well organized you can skip the bodega on lanzarote otherwise worthwhile destinations breakfast should have been offered earlier on the second day in madeira as the excursions started minutes after the restaurant opened after a disastrous experience with tuicruises last year i can only recommend aida
for us aida trips are pure relaxation and recreation but also getting to know the world through the many offersexcursions for us it was the th trip the next one follows in march and is already booked we are looking forward to getting to know countries cultures and people
great destinations and a pleasant atmosphere on board i collected many new impressions
after the th aida trip you feel like youre at home
a cruise with aida is well organized from the beginning from arrival to departure you always feel well looked after and can board the ship relaxed and disembark even more relaxed
aidacosma canaries best ship for children as always well organized and warm
overall nice trip
it was a great trip with motivated humorous staff and a versatile ship id love to go again
very good organization of the excursions good food and very good service spacious cabins and good cabin service very friendly attentive and helpful waiters
with aida it is always worth a trip
you can spend a very individual holiday on aida according to your own needs
i can only say positive things about the aida it was my second trip and the service food and drinks were all top notch unfortunately you cant do this more often as the price obviously plays a role but quality has its price
my first cruise on the aida nova was a test i am grateful for this experience it was fantastic the friendliness of the staff was sensational the bars restaurants the food on offer was top priceperformance top stars plus
it was very pleasant to travel
there is something for everyone on aida the cosma is very beautiful with varied food and locations unfortunately the drinks menu is shrinking more and more for whatever reason you can relax on aida and get to know new countries all in all this was a very nice vacation
our first cruise with aida cosma was a wonderful experience within a week we reached so many wonderful ports beaches and cities and experienced so much whether on land or on the ship for us it was simply pure luxury
aida is always worth a trip and the priceperformance ratio is almost unbeatable
this is my first cruise and it was great
great concept very nice ships and super good staff very good relaxation possible on board
overall a good trip if you like mass tourism good value for money attention check in had no idea about entry requirements definitely clarify with aida in advance we were not allowed to go and were able to clear up the error on aidas part at the last moment we were allowed to go with
i have been there so many times and it was always very nice
aidacosma we had a great holiday overall on what is currently the largest ship in the aida fleet however the ship was fully booked on our trip and it was noticeable on port days the crowds were spread out well on sea days almost all of the nice areas of the ship were overcrowded there was no place to relax outside and you had to stand in long lines in the buffet restaurants at the various bars you had to wait up to minutes for your drink the quality of the food made it clear that the aidacosma is all about mass tourism next time we will choose one of the smaller ships
apart from a few minor details it was an allround successful cruise
great trip good route good service
once again discovered great places and enjoyed the service on board
we booked through a travel agency and the holiday began from there
it was a nice trip from november th to december th from mallorca to dubai on the prima excursions in dubai should be better organized first the excursionists go through immigration then those staying on board
aida cosma stars because a lot of things were good but i think the pools are far too small simply far too small and there are far too few pools i would have hoped for a few more and no parasols and if there were parasols there were far too few i even got sunburnt but otherwise it doesnt matter in the light green area but because of the few complaints i am only giving it stars i would be very happy if there were sports decks and bigger goals like those on aidas cosma the goals are tiny i would be happy if the goals were as big as handball goals and new balls i think its nice that the balls are free thanks a tip from me for the theater it would be best to put up a barrier because the security guards scold the poor people just because they walk past with the barrier there wouldnt be so many security guards to look after and more mini models of the ship you travel on and maybe more slides it would also be nice if there was a description of where the slides are im going again next summer holiday with aida cosma like the old summer holidays i love aida cosma bye bye your lerok thrab i love aida cosma bye bye bye bye
as camping lovers we never thought we would end up on a cruise ship two weeks ago i booked my th aida trip in just over a year always a lovely varied relaxing holiday nice people nice staff and beautiful places
i booked a trip with aida from hamburg to stavanger as a present for my th birthday not only has the route to copenhagen been changed but to top it all off the trip has been converted into a festival or pop music party i might as well send my inlaws to ballermann it was our first booking with aida and definitely the last
the cruise was great unfortunately there were some poor organizational situations this time which i would have expected from aida the lack of information makes life more difficult for themselves than it needs to be which puts reception and guests in a bad mood otherwise the service staff and the food are always excellent unfortunately the two djs werent really in the mood to party they had a bit of trouble with the sequence of songs after a great atmosphere a slow terrible song came on which was often the case it was a very nice vacation with aida you can always improve
we were pleasantly surprised it was our first cruise and we quickly realized that the aida would meet our expectations for our vacation and future vacations due to the lively atmosphere on board entertainment disco party in the bars the opposite would be the meinschiff which is more geared towards peace and wellness
we liked the countries in the short time but unfortunately panama had to give way you can do an aida cruise once in a while but reception service could be improved room service was great bars and drinks if you have allinclusive that needs to be done better long queues staff sometimes unfriendly and overwhelmed soft drinks have to be kept separate otherwise you get the impression that there are long queues the program and music needs to be revised a lot of it is old school
aida is how you imagine a vacation
we love the aida concept the aida ships their friendly competent and personable employees the peaceful happy company with people of different nationalities the openness and warmth of all employees it is always beautiful and opens our hearts travelling with aida shows us how peaceful coexistence works and gives us hope for the future thank you
a fleet of ships that is geared towards a unique holiday experience always happy
aida is always a nice holiday
we have always had a good time travelling with aida we would be happy to do so again
we simply feel at home on board the aida fleet
a beautiful trip with a great ship and a great crew
we like traveling with aida because it is relaxed and entertaining there are lots of activities on offer and you always get to meet nice people
the excursions are often too short halfday and fullday excursions should be planned since there are usually several interesting destinations on one island you should also have the option of combining two activities without having to return to the ship first
once youve made it onto the ship its usually really nice the staff are mostly friendly and dedicated the problem is the package tour for the third time aida has changed our departure or destination airport sometimes at very short notice a few hours or very cleverly probably in the hope that the guest wont notice it makes a big difference whether you fly from munich or frankfurt as aida likes to change its also the same whether i can get on the ship straight away when i arrive or whether i have to take a hour bus ride first i find the procedure outrageous its increasingly ruining my vacation which is a shame but aida doesnt care anyway
we have travelled with aida many times and have always been very satisfied it was only with our departure that aida and emirates covered themselves in glory
great experience the cruise in the caribbean was very well put together and very well organised even the transfer of the suitcases from the plane to the balcony cabin the ship aidaluna was very nice very clean very friendly staff and very good and extensive food and drinks the only point a lot was in german
on the transvoyage from the mediterranean to the canary islands the selection of ports was excellent there was something new to discover in every port in terms of food and entertainment nothing was left to be desired and every smile was returned twice both by the staff and fellow travelers aida is always a pleasure to use
great route great ship good food met very nice people
superb transvoyage from palma de mallorca to gran canaria great food and service on board great aida stars shows and guest performers such as sarah barelly travesty and annemarie and wayne carpendale great trip
as always it was a very nice trip from november th to november th
even if not everything is perfect the holiday feeling and the friendly service are important
aida is always worth a trip but they must not become more expensive
it was everything you would want from a cruise you hardly have to worry about anything
you can possibly pass on your experiences to other guests
met some really nice people seen beautiful areas and cultures
after many busy days a relaxing holiday
it was our first cruise and it met our expectations
very good cruise to the south of norway with the aidanova we will definitely come back on board even if the size of the ship somewhat spoils the holiday experience and the cost pressure is noticeable on board
aida cruises the perfect product for the german market quality cleanliness competence and a noticeable sense of togetherness among the crew create this special feeling of wellbeing the quotaidabellaquot is an older and much smaller ship and is of course not comparable to the quotaidanovaquot where there are for example significantly more opportunities to retreat with twice the number of passengers however the friendliness and professionalism are certainly comparable top notch
it was a nice trip unfortunately the service has deteriorated considerably
we can only recommend aidaluna a fantastic eventful holiday where you can relax and unwind
the cruise was a success and we spent many pleasant hours with many nice people on board the nights were sometimes too short
we are very happy with aida and can absolutely recommend it the food is varied and very tasty there is something for everyone the service in all areas is also great and friendly some guests could learn a thing or two from that in any case we would be happy to travel with aida again
great ship great crew and delicious food my first choice for cruises
for me personally it wasnt anything special it was my first cruise and most likely my last
always worth a trip with the aida the heated indoor pool and the sports area are most important to me
perfect holidays
we spent days traveling from mallorca to gran canaria the cosma is a great ship but much too big for our needs if it is fully booked it will be very crowded
aida has improved its entertainment and the shows are world class for every taste you should think about the high prices for excursions cake only with affordable coffee
overall we were satisfied with the trip
good organization good service attractive destinations pleasant atmosphere
another pleasant trip everything was well thought out excursions through aida a little expensive for my taste all shore excursions planned independently service was first class you can see that the service staffs concentration and attention wanes after several days of hour shifts childfriendliness is top notch
allround successful holiday
everything was perfect and we really enjoyed this wonderful trip and will repeat one or the other at least once a year with aida
aida thinks of everything to make your holiday as enjoyable as possible
a relaxing dream trip in southern norway with great service on a beautiful christmasdecorated ship and a great winter route
first cruise with aida we had to rethink things a bit as we have only ever travelled with msc if you want to make a comparison aida is worlds better when it comes to food
a fantastically beautiful transvoyage with aidablu to the seychelles and mauritius thanks to the excellent hotel and entertainment management employees are highly motivated and guests are animated and very satisfied the quality of aida has improved greatly unfortunately there are still shortcomings the poor telephone accessibility rostock ruins a lot of things here and with the following points the poor customerunfriendly website which puts off many customers the technically poor internet access on board which could be made easier and more stable if experts finally optimized it
the hosts on aida stella are great there just need to be more of them the activities are great and are always carried out with a lot of fun and motivation
all in all a perfect holiday we have already booked our next trip on board
aida is always great but dont travel on one of the big ships such as aida cosma with passengers chaos is inevitable only travel on smaller ships and enjoy the full holiday feeling mar blu stella etc the family is there and everyone says goodbye to aida
aida trips are always something i look forward to super friendly staff beautiful tours and delicious food in a relaxed atmosphere
an excellent cruise in winter
wonderful trip would love to go again
super nice cruise great provider with super motivated employees
a cruise with aida means vacation in perfection you can plan your vacation however you want and aida will help you with whatever you want and guide you through your vacation without any worries of course you pay for these options and this help at every turn but you never have the feeling of being ripped off from a wild night of partying to an evening event for young and old to just the two of you in your room on the balcony cruising over the water in a hammock perfect
professional very nice caribbean trip with aida diva fromto la romana dominican republic
we had a good cabin the staff was friendly we had a lovely trip we celebrated our th wedding anniversary on november nd with a bar on tour
great offer and a very nice holiday
very good trip and a relaxing holiday on aida
i love the social life on the aida ships the staff are relaxed and can join in the party everything is great for me
i like the relaxed friendly atmosphere on board the many different leisure activities on offer i dont like the fact that so many sunbeds are still reserved in the morning long before breakfast time and nothing is done about it
first time on a cruise was great
another great holiday even if the travel time brought with it very stormy seas always aida
as soon as you get on board you get the holiday feeling
going on board aida on holiday no matter which ship is now almost like coming home my hotel shows me the world accurate
once aida always aida it has infected us always an experience with beautiful destinations pure relaxation
good food good entertainment in the evening nice excursions good price
this was my fourth cruise with aida and i am extremely satisfied the weather was good of the time i am very happy about that
traveling on a cruise ship is the most comfortable way to travel
my best holidaynothing more needs to be writtenaida travela must
was a great cruise with aida stella
we were very satisfied with aida and we will come again
it was one of the most beautiful trips so far on a great ship with great ship management captain and crew and the great people from the service staff deserve praise thank you
it was a very nice trip with aida to the caribbean and i would love to do this trip again with aida
great logistics at checkincheckout absolutely all crew members contributed to making this cruise an unforgettable vacation and a big thank you for that no matter which restaurant or bar you visited you always felt like a guest recommendation is definitely not an exaggeration as this is not the first time i have been on the aida
a fantastic cruise with extremely friendly service it was wonderful to be a guest and part of the aida family
travelling with aida is highly recommended
a really lovely holiday i would go back again ive caught the aida fever
the reputation of aida cruises remains convincing
dream vacation in the caribbean
a perfect trip many thanks to the aida team who put in so much effort
it was a nice trip and a lot of effort was put into it i would do this trip again and again
we were satisfied with the cruise
aida again and again good relaxation on board great excursions price performance top
the itinerary was beautiful
the aida is professional very good food very good entertainment program very friendly staff always a smile on their face it was wonderful we are very happy to see aida thank you
the bike tours provide a good opportunity to actively get to know the region
experienced many different cities and countries and every evening going back on board with a good feeling being welcomed in a friendly manner entering a clean cabin etc
i only travel with aida because i really like the concept i have done event trips with ms but i wouldnt want to do a normal cruise there
my aida trip will take place in midjanuary on november aida offered me the opportunity to take part in a cabin upgrade auction after sleeping on it for a night i placed a bid aida then quickly confirmed my bid aida is taking its time to accept my offer until days before departure and this was not mentioned at all in the offer this will be the longest auction days that i have ever taken part in it would be nice if it were processed more quickly then you could possibly be happy for longer
another thoroughly relaxing holiday beautiful ports very nice captain polite and courteous staff wed be happy to go again
aida is like a second home you just feel at home the food is great the service staff are friendly and very hardworking the beds are super comfortable everything is clean
always happy to travel with aida for me it is the most relaxing moment of the year great trips great crew beautiful moments
so far we have always been very satisfied with aida as when problems arose they always looked for solutions in a very friendly manner unfortunately that was not the case on the last trip with the aida nova
the crew did everything to ensure we had a wonderful holiday
excursions disappointing long journey times too short a stay for sightseeing very rushed tours example azores idyllic old town ribeira grande and pineapple liqueur short tour in rg vulcao do fogo spectacular but only minutes stay pineapple plantation boring but minutes stay beach la romana isala catalina beautiful beach clear water very difficult to get out of the water due to the strong current and the step ocho rios falmouth beach resort small swimming area interspersed with seaweed bottom muddy with seaweed cayman coral beach resort very narrow unkempt loungers steps leading into the sea beach not seen not recommended those who were enthusiastic reported a fine sandy gently sloping beach with shady palm trees about minutes walk from the jetty descriptions of the excursions are often not very accurate the pictures are sample pictures that do not necessarily correspond to reality aida could ensure this in their terms and conditions conclusion for us no more excursions via aida advice to others ask about travel and stopover times research pictures of the places to visit elsewhere the information we were given about the excursions was sometimes incorrect although we did receive compensation however this does not replace the lost vacation day and the disappointment
great trip in a super organized clean and well equipped ship it was fantastic
a super beautiful relaxed trip
it was our first cruise and as always everything was very well organized
we really like the special concept and the many beautiful travel routes
a holiday on the aida ships is always like coming home
holiday relaxation interesting excursions good food nice staff all in all
aida cosma a super beautiful ship great cabin insane shows top entertainment very good food crew very friendly fabio best entertainment manager such a lovely man would love to go again with aida cosma
beautiful destinations great staff pure vacation
great trip great service professional handling of the trip
all in all the relaxing effect was there we enjoyed the sun and the sea but also met new people and their experiences the excursions with aida were ok of course we found excursions planned or not planned on our own more exciting alternatives should have been thought of for the two canceled days at sea especially since the problems in panama were known in advance the foreign office has already issued a travel warning nobody can do anything about the weather in the dominican republic where docking was impossible you can tell that the ship is getting on in years we made the best of it anyway and were happy with the service on board
aida is worth a trip everyone is very nice and friendly and good value for money a few things still need to be perfected here and there so no full star rating but all in all a very nice and high quality vacation
everything went well have a nice trip
it was pleasant all around on board a feeling of relaxation and contentment was always in the air everyone was so balanced nice
super great holiday
a cruise is pure relaxation and that is true at aida
there is nothing better than a holiday with the aida allround carefree package
the entire aida luna crew is simply great
great cruise great ports good ship
good service before the start of the trip
aida vacation is an allround carefree vacation a superbly thoughtout concept that leaves nothing to be desired and a crew that is always nice and friendly big praise also for the childfriendliness on board the food was delicious everywhere and very varied the captain put the icing on the cake every day with his daily information and the quotsail awayquot song as we set off simply great the choice of ports was also great so close to the centers you can explore a lot on your own with a small child and combine relaxation and sightseeing perfectly
the cruise with aida was once again very nice and relaxing we were able to relax very well and had a great time on board we had a particularly good time in the steakhouse on the aidacosma the restaurant manager and his entire team really did their very best for us and deserve recognition the food was also very tasty thank you very much
aida nova from to to norway
a dream holiday in southern norway weather in november simply beautiful
this was my first cruise and i was overwhelmed by everything thank you i will be happy to pass on the recommendation yours annerose tdtmann
everything was great first cruise
after three wonderful trips with aida this one didnt go so well
great trip top service very clean highly motivated staff perfectly organized was fun would do it again
the complete travel offer was great and extensive
all in all it was a wonderful trip
the south norway cruise was simply a wonderful experience
it was an allround beautiful and successful holiday
wonderful trip with great hosts
there are so many things to experience on board an aida and you can travel to many different places in a relaxed manner
for firsttime sailors it was wonderful from the activities on the ship to the excursions on land all in all we were completely satisfied
a very nice and organized trip
a great holiday the aida will see us again
great vacation
i thought my trip was great the food was delicious top quality and varied the cabin was super comfortable clean and very practical with a walkin closet what i would have liked is a coffee machine in the cabin
i feel unique every time and can get the permanent smile off my face as soon as i see the ship i feel totally relaxed
since i am a frequent traveller on aida it must be good
it was once again a great trip with the aida cosma the ship is amazing and you have to experience it at least once
the trip on the aidaluna through the caribbean and central america was a complete disaster dont book the internet flat rate package they charge you and nothing works logging in again up to times a day is standard its no fun and never worth the price dont go to reception with your concerns here you will find the carefreeness that you would like as a vacationer but no professional help if you like to lie like a sardine on the sun deck youve come to the right place but dont forget put your towel on the lounger of your choice before breakfast dont worry the aida staff will not clear the lounger some loungers are quotoccupiedquot all day without anyone coming if youre thirsty plan ahead because it can take minutes to get a drink at the pool bar all in all this day cruise shouldnt cost more than then youve done everything right
this was the fourth time ive been on an aida cruise and i can only say that id be happy to go back good entertainment super friendly staff ship well maintained and clean
the aida cosma is a beautiful ship i went on the dubai trip in january despite the size of the ship everything is incredibly organized im looking forward to the next trip in december
it was our sixth cruise with aida and once again it was wonderful our next trip is already planned
for me aida is the best way to travel and experience something here you feel at home and like part of a big family
was another great vacation
top tip for a trip to the canary islands please pack your swimwear in your hand luggage so that you can enjoy the pool area immediately after checking in
unique and beautiful landscapes the ship aida cosma was really beautiful
we had great weather whale sightings northern lights and beautiful excursions what more could you want
beautiful but huge ship
the organization from arrival to departure is very good and relaxing the service and the staff are pleasant and courteous the organization of excursions and entertainment right down to the country information from the lecturers is great
great ship lots of variety very nice route once aida always aida for me there is no other vacation
we enjoyed our trip according to our ideas and wishes we would be happy to travel with aida again
great trip everything perfect keep it up aida
we had a great trip to the far north we were thrilled by the northern lights and by our encounters with gray whales and orcas
we like to travel with aida because of the uncomplicated nature you just have to be careful that it doesnt get too casual
everything about the trip
aida my hotel shows me the world this saying is so true arrive unpack enjoy your holiday to the fullest forget everything around you it simply couldnt be better and to be presented with a new adventure every day no hotel in the world can compete with that
we were on the feelgood cruise and had a great week on board the aidastelle a topnotch sports and nutrition program the best trainers and aida gourmet experts franz schned alexander eder and gnther kroack were on the stella olympic champion kristina vogel is also a great personality if this themed cruise is offered again be sure to book it
we were able to visit canary islands
the aida cruise was worth the trip and gave me new experiences
see other cities in other countries that you would never otherwise get to
the allround package at aida always makes it attractive for us the ships management also informs guests about common and unusual events
always worth a trip
fun on holiday with nice people and many new experiences
super organized holiday
i was alone on the aida with my son years old and had a wonderful stay my son was able to go to the kids club twice a day for hours although you could have more time by arrangement and i had time for myself
been on the aidacosma for the very first time everything was super clean friendly crew great food days in the mediterranean unique always again aida
a trip to see the northern lights in northern norway from october th to november th with aidamar great crew and super captain who was happy to wake us up at am because of the amazing northern lights above the ship an unforgettable trip with northern lights and orcas as the icing on the cake
our trip from october th to november th with aidamar autumnal northern lights fantastic experiences top crew great guest stars smiles and goosebumps every day wed love to come back
indescribably beautiful i can only recommend it to everyone lt
on the aida great care is taken to ensure that holidaymakers feel completely comfortable and can relax everyone is very friendly and accommodating this means you can enjoy your time and relax wonderfully
super nice vacation crew was great show was unique
a great trip friendly staff lots of experiences great rooms with sea views would happily go again the return journey at the airport was not well organised very confusing and stressful
it was a very relaxing holiday
great trip with nice interesting excursions
great value for money very nice ship lots of free sports activities great shows
well the trip itself was good
it was our first time on a cruise and we are very satisfied thank you for this wonderful trip it was really a great tour all around i would particularly like to emphasize the friendliness of the staff the cleanliness of the entire ship and the good organization of the trip
it was y st time and a great experience with aida cruise from the food to costumer service relaxation activities it was really worth it
for the first cruise we chose a great ship the best memories for this year definitely collected with the aida
beautiful cruise experience with a very good priceperformance ratio
aida always perfect thank you for the wonderful holiday
i spent wonderful days and would repeat it any time
i can only recommend that everyone should have their own experience with a cruise i really enjoyed it apart from a few minor things ill definitely go again
a very nice time on a beautiful ship
great trip
wonderful trip with the aida prima
aida lacks a concept some things are not well thought out and the daily program is not adapted to the guests there is no longer any incentive for quotfrequent travelersquot there is a lack of innovative ideas
i wanted to give a big compliment to the customer service i booked my trip for january however i had to postpone the date which was previously november because i was moving i had contact with various customer service employees several times and was really amazed at how super nice and friendly everyone is a big thank you for that
it was our first cruise in the end we adults children were very satisfied the first few days were chaotic and haphazard until we had found everything then the relaxation began we will go on a cruise again but maybe not with aida for comparison the process on land went very well we booked rome directly with aida but were unable to enter the port due to the stormy sea the refund was quick and problemfree we did all the other shore excursions on our own these also worked very well wellness massages were very good unfortunately the sauna and sports area were partially fully booked the staff were really very friendly and helpful in all areas
in my opinion aida has moved towards mass tourism at least in europe this is damaging to the image and in the long run will possibly cause customers with purchasing power to switch to other companies incidentally i heard this opinion several times on our trip on the stella
we booked the cruise from corfu to antalya with the aidablu the inside cabin is definitely not recommended very loud knocking and water noises behind the cabin is a stairwell with a steel staircase that is used by employees the knocking noises make you jump up in the night and are definitely not relaxing
top vacation beautiful harborsplaces with lots of funny people and always being somewhere different on a new day
aida fulfills the expectations of a cruise outstanding cuisine good destinationsports
very nice holiday very friendly and accommodating staff great entertainment and a variety of different offers you have to experience something like this once or several times
was again a nice relaxing cruise holiday with great weather
aida is always beautiful
everything okay on the trip
holidays with children are important to me that was possible on the ship even with supervision
great cruise that we would gladly do again anytime
as always a great relaxing eventful trip with aida thank you very much
beautiful big ship
fantastic cruise always happy to go with aida
very pleasant and relaxing trip there is still room for improvement in the childrens activities
a really great cruise with everything your heart desires the aida team is always helpful and committed the aidablu is a great ship that is just the right size to get a real cruise feeling
everything is always right at aida very good ships very friendly staff very good organization very good food very good locations on board interesting excursion offers
it was a successful trip all around we are going home with many impressions and well rested thanks to the crew of aida stella
there were very good questions about vacation
everything is good we are extremely satisfied it was already our th trip with aida and definitely not our last
it was a very nice trip with aida cosma the service was great the food was great despite the weatherrelated cancellation of rome the atmosphere was great
we had a great time relaxing and seeing a lot on the transatlantic trip
the ship aida cosma is simply brilliant whether you are with or without children there is always something to do the kids will never get bored and there is plenty of exercise all day long however this ship is too big for me
relaxation and rest
the vacation begins as soon as you board the plane everything runs smoothly thank you for allowing me to experience this
ships are great cabins are nice very familyfriendly crew very helpful and friendly wellness area great however i would advise against booking arrival and departure through aida dont have too high expectations of the quality of the food and service in the buffet restaurants
we did a day trial trip with the nova aida now has new fans we will book again
i have nothing to complain about it was a great time simply brilliant
once aida always aida our th aida trip this time with aida costa simply beautiful everything went wonderfully arrival stay food entertainment everything was top notch only top marks from us
it was our best holiday so far we were able to completely switch off relax and experience lots of new things
it was an allround successful trip
great service before during and after the trip
great short trip gladly again
our very first cruise was a complete success great value for money
for the next aida trip we will book we will choose a smaller ship
every aida is different but we still think the aida is great and would happily recommend it we are already planning our next trip
dangerous environment it is not ok for aida to travel this route i have cancelled i hope that everyone who goes on the trip returns safely best wishes erik sch
great trip wonderful vacation mostly very friendly staff
it was a great trip nice excursions very nice ship perfect crew
great ship great staff thats how you go on holiday thank you for that we felt very comfortable
a great short trip it was our first time on a cruise as a family we had a lot of fun and great entertainment the entire aida crew is amazing the service was first class in every area huge praise unfortunately the days went by far too quickly we will definitely be back
another great cruise on board the kussmund fleet for the first time in a suite with great service in the lounge
great trip great service
it was a wonderful time that we look back on fondly we would go back on the aida in a heartbeat
a trip that showed once again that a guest is just another quotpayingquot guest rarely have i experienced such a disastrous trip other providers do it much better
since i have already been on aida cruises filling out the questionnaire after each cruise is very annoying if the cruises werent good i would choose a different ship
like the previous years a great holiday
we booked the big caribbean winter break back in february of this year now this trip is being offered at a discount of euros per person with the same conditions never book early again
very nice trip that we can only recommend
looking for relaxation found back pain completely wornout mattress and days of back pain as a result when asked they said rudely quotreplace the mattress thats not plannedquot by the way individual travelers are apparently not planned either or better not welcome no opportunity to go ashore because ports were canceled without replacement no places to retreat anywhere even the library was directly opposite the show stage open really everywhere on the ship just show sound and noise around the clock if youre looking for peace and quiet youre looking in vain tip if you really want it then definitely book a veranda cabin its expensive but then youll at least have a little peace and quiet for yourself the german reception staff were monosyllabic and rude the only ones who really managed to convey a feeling of vacation were the many filipino service employees who impressed with their friendliness politeness zest for life and commitment no one will get me to do aidaperla again
actually almost everything was a completely satisfactory package we will definitely travel with aida again it was really nice
transvoyage from mallorca to dubai with the bella in october very good entertainment excellent lecturer michael cornely with lots of very useful information about the destinations committed crew great pool programs white dinner and shark bar good guest artists eg tatiana perez good food good housekeeping good music band it was just beautiful
very sophisticated travel planning and itinerary no complaints whatsoever the trip met our expectations and in some cases exceeded them an unforgettable trip aida is highly recommended
great vacation
almost everything was great except for a few excursions
from the beginning to the end of the trip the aida staff were always present and helpful the cleanliness of the ship was impressive
top company pure vacation
we were overwhelmed by the impressions that the route offered us on our trip we were thrilled by the organization and the wide range of options on board as well as the range of excursions and activities and of course the food and drinks one small downside was the whistling sound of our balcony door when the wind was strong
we were travelling with aida for the third time and we really enjoyed it
all in all it was a pleasant time
once aida always aida for our children it was a premiere that was awaited with great anticipation and excitement and we parents felt just as comfortable on the ship as we did a few years ago if you can ignore the fact that you are in this floating luxury hotel with thousands of other guests then you can have a wonderful vacation the service the facilities the leisure and entertainment options on an aida ship are excellent the opportunity to see something on shore excursions that you might not otherwise go to is also excellent and is also a key factor in the cruise if a destination does not interest you you can just stay on board
individual travel planning and cool people
simply a great cruise to norway and denmark everything was perfect great food great staff wonderful entertainment and a unique atmosphere we would do it again anytime
it was my first cruise from hamburg to norway days long and i am more than satisfied and delighted in all areas food service cleanliness friendliness check inout entertainment excursions and much more everything was just right i would definitely take a cruise with aida again
unfortunately in recent years aida has increasingly focused on making money rather than giving passengers a nice holiday which is a shame because it used to be different
just mass tourism has nothing to do with cruises aida just wants to make a lot of money the guest is no longer the focus too many people for the ship and ports too many children with no rules raging on the ship until midnight while the parents indulge in alcohol conclusion never again on vacation and ships with more than guests better to have an expensive but relaxing vacation a paradise for children
for me aida is the deepsea version of the butter cruise they try to get extra money out of your pockets at every turn the services included in the standard travel price are mediocre selection and quality of food and drinks leisure activities on board conditions in the restaurants you have to dig deep into your pockets for anything beyond that in future i would rather travel with tui again i pay more but the quality is good too
great trips what can still be improved is the priceperformance ratio of the aida shore excursions
great trip with beautiful destinations the allinclusive package is not recommended at all because of the long waiting times at the bars but that seems to be politically desired the offer for an internet flat rate is completely overpriced
the conviviality on board delicious food and drinks great sports on offer and a teens club that makes it easy for young people to get to know each other make a vacation on the rocking sea a dream trip great entertainment
a lovely and relaxing way to spend your holiday with very friendly and dedicated staff and an endless selection of very good food good value for money thank you very much
it was once again a wonderful experience to travel with aida despite some weatherrelated changes the team did everything to ensure a wonderful trip and stay once aida always aida
great trip
it was a breathtaking holiday anytime again
the holiday begins when you step on board immerse yourself in another world wonderful for exploring relaxing and having fun
the bookable excursions are definitely far too expensive
aida is no longer what it once stood for anyone who embarks on a trip especially during the holidays on the new ships should not be under the illusion that they are booking a cruise with a tv character it is what it is a moneymaking machine for investors on the high seas with no consideration for the customer who should actually be the focus
very comfortable bed delicious food super friendly staff very clean ship made our vacation unforgettable of course very beautiful aida stars accompanied us wonderfully on our days at sea we and the children felt very comfortable there we will be back
a culinary experience on board the aida sol great service on board saw two great shows explored norway
aida cosma offers everything your heart desires but unfortunately you hardly have the opportunity to enjoy peace and quiet
there was a large family on the aidasol traveling to norway everyone felt comfortable and looked after a big compliment to the entire crew as well as the people in the background at the luggage service aidas headquarters
everyone should take a trip like this because there is a lot to see and explore
the cruise was lovely the evening programme in the threatrium was the best varied always something to laugh about unfortunately we didnt see any northern lights
aida is definitely worth a trip the organization to and from the ship the cabin the hardworking friendly and helpful staff the food the programs everything was outstanding and great for me the only downside was guests who constantly occupied loungers with their towels and were absent all day or those who pushed around during meals and thought they were going to starve even though there was food available day and night
we had a great tour of norway and a lovely family holiday thank you
perfect vacation for those who love cruises service offers and cleanliness are hard to beat
the very best cruise experience there is there is no better option
the aida cosma is much too big and was fully booked due to the holidays interesting offers can only be used with long queues and the associated stress too few pools especially on sea days
the trip was wonderful again all expectations were fulfilled
it was a nice trip but the wrong time of year but even aida cant change the weather
it was a great holiday that i would repeat anytime
a relaxed and varied way to see a bit of the world in a short time without having to forego good food sporting activities and entertainment
aida nova is a huge ship with passengers so of course there are lots of great things on the ship but many things cost extra but if you can and want to spend a lot of money on your vacation youll have a lot of fun everyone should try it out
great trip with a great captain who is very concerned about the safety of his guests
it was my first trip with aida cruises and the aida cosma and definitely the last time under these conditions first of all i have to say that we booked a trip during the holidays this is something you should definitely pay attention to if you want to relax on the ship and enjoy some peace and quiet it was just far too crowded sun loungers and places to retreat to were permanently reserved with towels even if the people had spent half the day on land in my opinion its a disgrace when you dont have the opportunity to retreat on deck and enjoy the weather but instead have to walk several laps only to find always disappointingly that everything is taken and reserved the same goes for food at the buffet restaurant you couldnt eat if you were hungry but only when a seat became available the same applies to the shows in the theatrium or studio x and having to arrive an hour early just to get a halfway acceptable seat where you can also see something has nothing to do with vacation for me but rather with time management what i also found very unfortunate was the siege of the whirlpools in the days of the trip i was in the whirlpool once for about minutes without children diving jumping and playing for me it had absolutely no place there i dont even want to start on the trip to rome absolute disaster instead of booking buses in one day almost all of which left at the same time why not plan the berth for two days and split the trips up and not have to force myself to order more buses the day before the staff were positive they were always very courteous and friendly the food was delicious and of good quality although it was almost only possible to eat in the market restaurant arrival and departure were very well organized conclusion if i were to go on a cruise again it would either be with aida under different conditions no holidays smaller ship etc or a completely different company
we had a great vacation and saw some great destinations the service on board was perfect you really feel at home on the aida there is really nothing to criticize after the trip everything was perfect
the whole trip
good boat great itinerary and very good food
was a great norway tour
its always a wonderful holiday feeling
overall we were satisfied with all the services and will book another trip next year
good tour operator
nice trip booked at short notice experienced a lot had a good rest a success all round
my first cruise and certainly another one will accompany my decisions until the end of my life
even if the weather isnt so good days on the baltic sea is a nice trip to relax and be pampered
the entire aida package is harmonious and perfect
if i hadnt had this claustrophobia the vacation would have been great
as always on a ship in the aida fleet it was a pleasant relaxing holiday with lots of impressions of a new corner of our world friendly and helpful staff on board make the best weeks of the year perfect
i can only speak positively about aida everything is very relaxed and you dont have to dress up its vacation and you want to be free
aida always happy to go for me its a very relaxing trip and if you go against the average tourist in terms of meal times then you can enjoy a little peace and quiet on holiday even on a very large ship
the processing of the trips is reliable and real

hello color line i would like to say thank you for a super good trip and thank you for decorating my brotherinlaws room on fantasy for his th birthday and the little gift from the crew always a pleasure to travel with you
ive just returned from the trip it wasnt my first trip and i was a bit disappointed there was a big hole in one of the towels the bed linen was clean but pretty worn the hairdryer that was advertised was not there i went to the counter on the ship and complained the lady just said that you cant check every towel and every hairdryer oh well but you can always charge for it
we had a fantastic days on this ship everything was great we especially enjoyed the fantasy show in the theater many thanks to the artists

really a good trip really welcoming staff who just make the trip better it is especially cool with the new childrens area on deck my year old daughter had a party from start to finish of the journey the only wish we have is that the childrens areas open earlier in the morning many children get up early and stay there until oclock thank you for a fantastic mini cruise
though it was my first ever experience on i could say it was one of the best journey of my life i really appreciate all the facilities that i got on cruise
we had a wonderful experience with dfds we enjoyed the beautiful sea view from our window the terrace and the buffet at the seas restaurant i had the most fun at the columbus bar i would prefer to go again overall it was a fantastic experience
great trip was upgraded on an overnight from oslo to copenhagen bigger room with a sea view was great steak dinner was throughly enjoyable drinks and entertainment were also good crew were all cheerful and engaging all recommended
pleasant and smiling service good information good cabins and a nice ship absolutely perfect

absolutely fantastic trip to copenhagen with dfds
lovely ship with many options for entertainment a tiptop weekend trip
thanks for a nice trip everything worked fine
we have had a very nice time
super good trip for a little break from everyday life however it is a good idea to bring food from home as the prices on the boat can be sky high otherwise really good staff and friendly and polite service
we had a nice trip full of entertainment for the children both treasure hunting horse racing water park and good food the pirates put on a good show
went on a day cruise with a friend and had a great time there are lots of fun places to hang out and good activities among other things we enjoyed participating in bingo and music quizzes caught a magic show and spent a lot of time watching the beautiful views and sunsets from the deck or windows all with no ekstra charge all staff was very helpful and kind wether we needed help with something needed directions or just had questions or comments we had one small issue with a bright light on a phone in our room and when we told reception they sent over two people right away we went straight down to the room and met them the issue was fixed within minutes after asking in reception i definately recommend the trip if you can handle waves and wind d
jonas the pirate on the crown was simply fantastic he made the childrens trip very enjoyable we will definitely come back every six months
we enjoy it every time we are with dfds its the second time this year its raining a christmas trip too fantastic
the perfect commodore de luxe cabins with the lounge on the king are as always a good start and a good finish of our holiday in scotland we travel yearly since through the years we stayed in all types of cabins theye all fine the experience is great good staff
thank you very much for the gift you have donated to the red cross which made it possible for me and my choirmate to realize the dream of a minicruise to oslo years ago i was supposed to have gone on a minicruise to oslo but it didnt come to fruition the journey itself was impeccable the cabin was well furnished no sea passage neither up there nor back bright nights so it was a pleasure to look at the coast and the water the breakfast buffet was sumptuous nothing was missing we decided to have dinner at the sea food restaurant and what opportunities for the sense of taste crayfish prawns mussels various fish species and a good glass of white wine at very favorable prices a lovely and unforgettable experience not least karl johans gade but thats another story thank you so much
the sailing trip is very nice but for a nature lover like me there is too much loud music in the speakers it is difficult to find a quiet place where you can hear the seagulls the waves the wind this time i sailed with crown even on deck where we stand watching for porpoises the music from the bar next door is blaring and then at crowe i also miss pearls outdoor hot tub
a good and lovely experience
the journey was changed due to the time i could not n meet up we had to go through p o i have to confess that the p o is waohhhhh very good
great journey quick and easy checkin great cabin with clean windows window washing good food and service in the restaurant if it hadnt been for a very expensive car park on the quay in oslo it would have been stars
the return trip was perfect friendly staff and lots of entertainment a big problem is the alltooshort stay in oslo cant you just wait once a week to sail from oslo until so that we minicruisers get more out of the trip
took the trip with our daughters partner on we had a lovely time all the staff were amazing plenty to do the cinema was a lovely way to wind down as well definitely recommend hope to be back soon
super trip albeit expensive
nice trip with very service minded staff
did an overnight cruise oslo to copenhagen many years ago did the overnight cruise from copenhagen to oslo last night with my four adult children and our experience was a clean comfortable and spacious cabins we did a commodore deluxe and thoroughly enjoyed use of the lounge snacks and drinks staff was friendly and helpful food was great my kids had a blast at the nightclub honestly a highlight of our two weeks in scandinavia every expectation was exceeded
really nice trip with lots of good food

great experience on the boat we took a trip from oslo to copenhagen and then back from copenhagen to oslo the boat on the way back was a bit older and we couldnt really manage to lower the temperature on our room as well as on the first trip and it was pretty warm inside we were adults and a baby otherwise there was plenty of space and we had a great time travelling there
childfriendly and pleasant journey lots of activities for the children and a nice breakfast and dinner buffet at seas restaurant
good service both before and after the cruise
lovely service and help to make the trip fantastic
great trip fine service good food and lovely cabins thank you
the first gesture of kindness was the travelling pack for my dog and a travelling with pets leaflet i was touched by the way there was a nice and clean dogs training place in the ferries waiting area thank you then i was pleased to see smiling and kind onboard staff around me a pleasant and helpful coffee shop assistant made my day everything was clean and bright excellent thank you
the room with a view the beautiful weather a great dinner and ending the evening playing backgammon in one of the bars was just a very nice experience
the only reason i give it stars instead of is because the mattress on the beds are so bad otherwise we had the best trip with nice restaurants bars and entertainment

fantastic trip impeccable service had a commando cabin on the th floor with its own balcony lots of good drinks and some snacks included the food at the buffet was lovely the service was fantastic only small minus was shopping the taxfree butikken was small and confusing and convoluted
as usual it was a top trip delicious food nice cabin and good service one thing we could wish for is that there was quotsome music from the s s and squot in the columbus club for hours after it would have been great we are many pensioners who travel during the week
premium lounge is the best way to travel

the trip was well organized from start to finish all the staff were very friendly and always helpful and always fulfilled our wishes
you found a way to accommodate my early arrival my trip got shorter with hours thanks
absolutely fantastic trip and all the people on the ticket box are very polite and professional
love travelling by dfds the staff are so friendly and the journeys so nice from newcastle to amsterdam and back the live entertainment could be improved though the live band although good go through the usual songs with variable enthusiasm a bit more variety for the evening would be great with other acts other than the live band in the main room its just bingo so before pm youve usually had enough but with such great drinks and hospitality its a shame people arent encouraged to stick around a bit longer as its a holiday for most people after all and it begins as soon as you get on the boat with such a lovely welcome the cinemas are unfortunately pretty basic like a home cinema without proper seating and the doors are locked once the film starts so you cant nip out within a film which i like to do so entertainment could overall be improved but at it is its ok
great welcome on board young man took our luggage to the door of our cabin which we were pleased to find had a window though wed gone for the more affordable inside cabin
friendly staff and a really nice trip
great minicruise a wonderful trip on sea with good food and nice service

great cabin on way out clean and very big on the way back the crossing was good
nice cabin better than i expected good food easy access to everything but internet price and quality was really bad to ask euros for hours the trip was not even that long and than at first it did not work at all and after it was so weak that it took time to properly show whatsapp netflix and youtube did not even open
great service plesent trip and well stocked duty free shop i would recommend coffee shop on board
always everything is at top on the cruise to oslo p
good service good food all in all a really nice trip we will come again soon
really wonderful experience a mining holiday that feels like a longer holiday i chose to go alone i had prebooked an inside cabin however the next day i chose to upgrade to a commodore cabin as i still had to buy internet and breakfast which was included in the price here moreover i had considered one with a sea view and in relation to other plans i would arrive at the terminal at so hours would be a long time to wait for ones cabin but with the commodore i could check in at pm it was worth all the money i had the opportunity to leave my things in the room and enjoy the deck afterwards the cabin was a good size enough hotel size like in kbh really delicious sea view from deck with two large windows a fridge for cold drinks two good armchairs where you could read a book or watch tv i tried sky bar when the ferry left a bit pricey but in relation to the experience and view it was all worth it the breakfast was also delicious the first morning i ordered the room the next day i ate at the restaurant i also tried a pizza which was also good good offers in tax free with eg on some clothes all the way through i met only super nice employees next time i travel with dfds and yes there will be a next time i will definitely try another upgrade either with a balcony or jaqousi thank you for a lovely experience have already told many about my trip and recommended it to others

we traveled home from oslo on friday february a storm and m high waves were promised i was really impressed by the efforts of the staff and the service in the restaurant it was done with a smile and we got everything we asked for apart from the fact that we didnt care about the sea passage and several of us had to go to the cabin it was a very nice experience
thank you so much for this surprise with cabin upgrading that was fantastic spacious comfortable and great window view
great experience good food good entertainment
its always great travelling with you i like that youve put thought to recycling and using reusable dishes for breakfast only slight downside is that i find the cabin a little stuffy we were in commodore deluxe its probably just personal but the duvets were really thick and cosy but didnt quite need to be so cosy i never slept well coz i was so hot only other minor was in the phone charger socket didnt work but those really are just a minor food n drink and comfort always fantastic would recommend
very pleasant crossing on a nice ship with excellent staff
easy embarkation good lounge and very pleasant ship
nice crossing service and catering very worn beds and pillows resulting in minimal sleep unfortunately it significantly detracts from an otherwise good trip had an alm room with lower bunks
excellent trip from newcastle to amsterdam my only negative would be the rooms were too hot only air coming in was from a small ac unit on the roof but it wasnt cool air despite adjusting it to full cold airtried everything to get it colder but was only slightly cool aside from that everything was great will definitely go again
nice trip and everything worked as it should
returned from newcastle to amsterdam mini cruise had a great experience really good value cabin was clean and bedsbedding comfortable food on board in explorers kitchen was excellent quality with lots of variety coach transfers into amsterdam were on time ship departures were on time and all staff friendly and welcoming
nice trip where everything worked information about the weather was provided good room and good food
its nice trip but it takes too much time to travel between these two cities cant really use it after work because it leaves to early and not before work because it comes in too late guess is part of the business but i wished it was a pm to am trip
amazing definitely the best way to travel to netherlands or even europe really nice staff great experience on the sea clean rooms great food we will definitely come back and i recommend anyone considering to book asap thank you dfds
very friendly welcome and perfect food and entertainment
great trip done newcastle amsterdam a couple of times now comfortable cabin very clean friendly helpful crew relaxed way of travelling only criticism the cabin is too warm even on the coldest aircon setting so not a great sleep

it is relaxed easy from booking to sailing
good hospitality and service reneka cabins and nice employees
had an online chat with the wonderful miriam who was incredibly helpful in changing the booking and at the same time she also helped to arrange this upcoming trip a little extra especially for a year old there should be more like miriam really appreciate the surprise you could arrange for us on this trip we are looking forward to it

it was better than expected neither of us had ever made a trip like this before but we really enjoyed it
very good journey as always only one bad thing kids play area is way too small
it was a nice journey though long we enjoyed the nice food and the vibes in the restaurants
great experience overall from the booking of the ticket to the actual journey

efficient on time clean and comfortable sailing
we had a great trip check in went quickly even though there were some computer problems we were very happy with our outside cabin the evening buffet and the breakfast buffet were fantastic however we must say that we were not satisfied with the christmas dinner on the th we were crammed together at some long tables with someone we didnt know it was blazing hot in the restaurant and it took far too long from the starter to the main course it must be possible to do better and then we would like to take a trip again
a really nice trip where the service was top notch
it has been a wonderful experience for both me and my child the commodore cabin experience is certainly special and in itself especially with the larger window and lovely space im looking forward to the next experience and for sure a commodore cabin i fell in love with christmas decorations which added a really cozy vibes to our experience thank you for everything dfds team
great cruise to kopenhagen
we went on a mini cruise to amsterdam which was a great wee break before christmas it all was very stress free and relaxed quite a difference from the airport experience we decided to go al a carte to treat ourselves on the way home the meal and service were excellent definitely worth the extra
as always a wonderful experience traveling with you and this time with the most wonderful gasbox
excellent trip on the mini cruise overnight sailings with a day in amsterdam in between car park was closeto the ferry in the cabin the bed was comfy with crisp white bed linen and warm duvets shower is small but excellent pressure and temperature coach transfer to and from amsterdam took mins plus a bit of waiting for the coach to fill up breakfast was excellent usual choices of hot food plus pastries fruits cereals cold meats cheeses only thing that could have been better was speed of initial boarding and then passport control on returning to uk
great for taking dogs to france and back i recommend premium lounge well worth the extra cost
this was a really fun thing to do we took the night cruise to amsterdam and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the boat is well equipped and the range of entertainment was great
always a pleasure to travel with pearl to oslo

it was a wonderful trip and super sweet staff but the christmas buffet was a big disappointment and didnt live up to the price at all we were surprised that there wasnt more variety as many have chosen it days in a row so we wont choose it next time but big praise for the young man who was a pirate it was pure entertainment for both children and adults
absolutely perfect and lovely relaxing mini cruise
comfortable way of traveling its good to relax on the boat rather than stress driving through sweden
really lovely staff warm welcome it was like a cruise ship welcome for going over the channel delayed due to a broken down truck on ramp but really well informed by crew and captain this made all the difference informed passengers are happy passengers we were both really surprised by how good it was
a fantastically nice trip go service can be recommended
all good comfortable premium lounge good for relaxing

a good experience went with my girlfriend on a mini cruise we had a good trip and we enjoyed ourselves thought the boat is nice and clean the only thing that could be upgraded a little in my opinion are the public toilets in the hallways but its a very good trip can highly recommend it
great trip so nice room so clean and really good food and such nice staff beautiful nature and good music it wont be the last time i take the trip thank you
i experienced orchestras and soloists on a return trip only one of the soloists had musical quality it was a bulgarian singer and guitarist who gave me a really good experience she was excellent the rest was horrible
good trip

very nice mini cruise beautiful ship with friendly crew delicious food and drinks cozy clean sleeping cabin the beds are great bathroom is basic coffee could be better
i had a nice trip by dfdsthe princess seaways was fantastic the sky bar breakfas and live music were great also the cartains and carpets were more stylish honestly there wasnt much of a different between king and princess seayways

great for a short trip
super nice crew they always help you and you are greeted very nicely great ship and super nice deluxe cabins everything is clean and the food is great and the selection is huge there is something for everyone the wifi is very bad on the ship i had absolutely no reception in the cabin but it was very good in the lounge

great want to travel again
it was a very successful stay from checkin to checkout
the whole process from booking to boarding and return journey was seamless and efficient yasmin looked after us very well in the premier lounge on both outward and return journeys
have a nice trip back and forth luckily we had cabins with a window without one seems a bit scary the beds are very hard and the pillows quite thin the bathroom is perfect great breakfast only booking breakfast afterwards for the way back was a pain in the ass
we had a fantastic trip one of the best out of times when we arrived there was a helper for my husband who is sick and cant walk much he was driven to the cabin and was picked up again when we got home we know some people on the ferry and when they heard it was my husbands last trip there were hugs thanks to the nice girls in italia super service so all in all really good trip
both trips were splendid first time used the relax chair before the long cartrip in the uk good for a next time
my wife and i had a trip at the end of june with pearl and encountered good service throughout the trip got upgraded to a bed and a bigger cabin without any problem and had a great time during the whole stay thank you for a great trip
we were well escorted to our commodore class cabin on deck which was very neat and clean the dinner buffet in explorers kitchen was excellent as well as the breakfast for us motorcyclists it was an excellent trip that is definitely worth repeating keep going
great mini cruise with good entertainment and food trip to amsterdam centre was run well
it has always been a pleasure to travel on your service efficient and comfortable the perfect start to any break
quick entry on to the ferry nice relaxing time in the premier lounge snacks and drinks were great
brilliant crossing cabins very clean
very nice and pleasant trip will return
helpful on the phone and at check and a good trip
really bad trip for kids everyone is drunk
efficient from booking online to landing in dieppe very pleasant crew
nice way to get to the other side in a relaxed way and you are also close to scotland upon arrival the holiday already starts on board
a wonderful experience and fantastic trip with dfds to oslo i was also very excited on the trip when i saw dolphins diving right in front of my window at the seas restaurant what a lovely surprise thank you for everything
nice and comfortable trip really helpful and smiling employees super delicious food in the buffet
ok cabin and smooth crossing everything was as expected
fantastic trip from kbh to oslo and back we have girlfriends who needed to get away from it all and needed a good experience we had a really good experience we were in the pool up and hearing about the whales you might be lucky enough to see on the trip we eat food in sese so delicious buffet morning and evening with really friendly and smiling waiters we had a good cabin close to the bobble zone so we were close to the pool all in all it was a really fantastic trip and we needed that so much
we had a wonderful cabin the food was great and we had a great breakfast i highly recommend this trip to anyone that would like to enjoy a little time off and relax
everything about this trip from changing my booking to the travel itself was a pleasure well done dfds
fantastic trip for children with fun experiences especially staff for the childrens activities gave it full speed so it was entertaining for the adults too meeeen it was very difficult to get into the room due to a lock that did not work as it should had to turn down the bunk bed myself and there was incredible noise in the room on arrival and departure the whole thing shook and it was impossible to sleep during the approach to frederikshavn as far as i know i had not booked a room where noise is expected despite this all in all a lovely trip especially for children and expect to go again soon
this is my trip i go for work in oslo i can do want i want onboard compared to flight and train sleep work on my laptop eat drink or listen to live music yesterday jakuzzi with sunset over kattegat was the best part you could extent it to star glazing as well i was too late to grab a sandwich from the cafe and had to eat the salty spaghetti med kdfarssovs i normally make this much more tasty myself plus the heiniken and fanta is allmost undrinkable i guess you can win them all but thanks for the service
overall experience was really awesome my friends and i enjoyed a lot cabin service is good and all the events conducted are really good my only suggestion is to give some more time for tourists to explore oslo as we get limited time hrs
great efficiency and comfortable passage it was very expensive since it is high season but i thought the experience was pretty seamless and well run
we had a nice trip calm wind conditions good food and friendly staff
one of the best cruises in the whole world stars from here
we had a great time on board the premiere lounge is lovely our tip book early boarding and the lounge
it was easy to book checkin and travel
all around positive from booking to the trip
we had a nice trip up and down again good service in restaurants and reception and clean cabins kind regards jan and merete andersen
went back and forth to newcastle by car as part of a fatherson trip to scotland wonderfully relaxing travel enjoy the sun and a drink on the deck sky bar eat buffet go to the cinema have a drink in the club then sleep in a nice cabin with a good firm mattress the next day we had breakfast rested and left for the boat to discover england and scotland the club may be called a point of improvement not really atmosphere cozy
relaxed crossing with great views and a decent lunch
we had a nice seat premium spot was luxurious
very comfortable crossing love the big leather seats
it was a comfortable journey
easy booking good price beautiful ships and a friendly crew i had already made this trip years ago and it was good then too
i was promised that i would get a room with a sea view that wasnt and weve all been sick so it wasnt such a great trip for us
i thoroughly enjoyed the trip had been via ijmuiden before that was just as excellent
we had a nice crossing with good service and lovely food from the explorer rastaurant
everything went well and the crossing was very pleasant everything is very well organized
we had a great trip our balcony lugar was nice had great food tooalready booked a new trip for me my sister in october
hospitality in the premier lounge was excellent
we really enjoyed the trip again the staff is very friendly and the food was again delicious the band was great and we are looking forward to our next trip greetings to all the king and princess staff tonia and anneke braat
nice trip to denmark
very nice and pleasant trips there and back depend largely on the weather the outward journey was very nice the return journey was not due to the weather an unoccupied car blocked the exit from the king seaway several cars including ours could not drive out as planned the time window for deck had then expired and only the other car decks were cleared after more than hours the blocked cars including ours were able to drive out better clearer announcement with the license plate of the unoccupied car etc the staff were very helpful and friendly the breakfast buffet was also great
friendly staff made a comfortable trip
easy and convenient way to travel fine cabins helpful staff and good food and shopping experiences
lovely trip to denmark in the summer of good dinner and breakfast buffet experience of good space on board even though there were many travelers
had a good trip there and back to newcastle clean room and good food and drinks plenty of choice
great trips both ways very friendly service and smooth crossings what more could one want
great trip so smooth no issues
we were cycling round the netherlands with our kids and it went really smoothly and the staff were fantastic from checkin to loading the bikes and to the actual sailing itself facilities spotlessly clean delicious buffet dinner cant wait to sail again
like a mini cruise very good service a good selection of included drinks and food nice big cabin with a view of the bow and very quiet simply perfect
fantastic first trip with crown to oslo the pirates girls and jonas were definitely the reason why our year old daughter had a great experience i hope they get rid of it we were wildly impressed the noise in the cabin was fixed without any problems the food in seas and the waiters were good both out and home the trip home a week later with pearl was not so good the pirates didnt really bother the kids although our girl really tried to get to play with them a bit disappointing after the fantastic experience on the other ferry overall a good experience
such an easy journey from check in to arrival no stress every comfort pleasant staff i will be back shame sailings make a day trip impossible these days
can highly recommend for beautiful but a bit busy in summer
good service comfortable travel efficient crew
it was a fantastic trip where the service has been top notch helena the navigator bar still needs an extra star she showed a good ability to handle a large group of people and the music in the navigator needs the same extra star thanks to the staff on board for a lovely trip
our family loves this trip to oslo we travel every year which has now become a fixed tradition in the family where we thrive and have quality time together on board
great trip great buffet great price
pleasant trip small rooms
can only be recommended if you are going to norway nice cabin with everything clean and tidy checkin went well and we landed in oslo on time

nice trip nice lounge we enjoined
its so relaxing nothing to achieve or do everything on my childs terms so just smiles fun and joy she loved the cute pirate ship the ball room and the bouncy castle we missed that the playroom was open in the morning she slept hours in a row both ways so i also slept well both guests and staff were nice and cozy and we especially loved the breakfast
a good trip i had but really bad service i forgot my phone in the room and it was found the next day it wasnt properly registered in the system so it wasnt seen as a phone and they only found out about months after and they were not at all to talk to on the phone
fantastic trip and fantastic crew
great timekeeping cabin clean and comfortable shower hot and good power
great value excellent destination
i recently went on a mini cruise between copenhagen and oslo it was the most pleasant trip with a delicious cabin good food and not least the sweetest and serviceminded staff on board the entertainment in the evening was perhaps not my style but it is very individual however there was one who sang and danced who was quite nice to look at and who could also sing and dance he smiled a lot and really seemed to love his job the mood and atmosphere on board was top notch i am so looking forward to sailing with you again one day if i didnt have a dog at home i would have applied for a job on board with all the nice people you met
always amazing crew worjing cery hard and very kind and helpfull i would never travel with other company as long u have this kind of people working there
had a fantastic trip with lovely food and service the only thing i could use is some better mattresses i get so much pain in my back from lying on them
excellent trip bit disappointed that the bar and dutyfree werent open for too long
great trip on mini cruise easy to get onboard no fuss great value for trip itself food bit pricey onboard but if you dont want to purchase that you can eat before you get on plan your visit to amsterdam well and you can fit in one good tourist experience anne franks house canal boat ride sex museum ice baralot to see and do
premium lounge was relaxing and had a variety of snacks and drinks easy boarding and pleasant crossing to dunkirk
perfect for weekend getaway in new castle dfds staff are superbvery friendly and welcoming the foods are lovely and the breakfast buffet are yum we been travelling here for a decade now and still we love it cos it feels home away from home especially seeing the filipino crews with their beautiful smiles dfds thank you for your good service and see you all soon

we have just been on a new years trip it can definitely be recommended beautiful cabins fantastic food and wonderful staff something is really being made of this trip
great trip xx
wonderfull trip
really enjoyable ship was spotlessly clean entertainment was brilliant
the journey itself
the trip was so smooth to be honest wasnt impressed with the breakfast the return trip the club lounge is the best thing ever so relaxing
good cabin able to sleep all way through night crossing
loved everything about the trip from newcastle to amsterdam only thing was the boat was delayed hour arriving at amsterdam which meant we only got so little time to see the city the evening buffet meal on the boat was not the best but the breakfast was lovely the rooms were spacious and the bed was really comfortable the best sleep i got in a long time
the convenience of location of departure and arrival abroad are excellent the comforts on board top floor or below are exceptional shopping and dining is classy entertainment in the louge is an extra
trips are great snacks in the premier lounge are a bit spars also need a pet lounge like p o
best trip in a long time i had an extended weekend with my husband and children and sister and her family the pleasure of being on a mini cruise with pearl seaways from copenhagen to oslo the whole trip was a great experience for all of us and the service was top notch all the way around it was a super trip that can be highly recommended big thanks to dfds and the employees on the ship especially the bubble zone gets huge praise for the good activities for the children and the canteen staff also deserve a lot of praise wish i could give them more stars
my trip was great but i wish the sky bar had been open the weather was warm enough
everyone of us enjoy the trip
great boat great trip
i have always found the crossing agreable and relaxing
everything was excellent in our outward journey however they keep changing the times of our return trip so it makes it difficult to plan the end of our short getaway when every minute it vital obviously we need to know changes but when it changes from pm to earlier at am that is a whole day out of a day trip
good trip well run bit expensive for a small campervan
my daughter and i had the most amazing trip the staff were amazing the cabin berths was so huge cosy and the food both morning and evening was super good all in all a nice trip back and forth
very much part of our enjoyable holiday apart from the return journey when delays in disembarking and driving away left us tired and late getting home
excellent journey dover to calais and back on time clean good food and cozy highly recommend
very good service and trip
the trip to uk and back to france was good organized with friendly and helpful staff it was a good experience for a very decent price
great trip with very helpful friendly staff nice tasty food too
punctual well organised enjoyable and relaxing travel from dieppe to newhaven and back
we travel with children so we need more children activity
nice sailing trip from oslo to kbh as always a lovely trip sweet and lovely service in the restaurant great food and wine some problems with ordering online
hassle free travel great start and end to our trip away to france
our first trip for four years everything went very well
a very nice way to travel when you have time ahead of you comfy seats and great english breakfast will do it again
i had a relaxing trip out and return although we were delayed on our return most of time lost was made up
great experience with kids i have just returned home from wonderful days on a minicruise we bought a mini cruise with charity where we supported ukraine for dkk i went alone with my children and bought breakfast where they ate for free as well as a childrens card for dkk where they got gifts ice cream drinks bracelets for the pool and even won a gift card in the horse race our cabin was right next to the bubble zone where our big girl could play by herself there is always staff and the worlds best pirate mille entertained with balloon animals face painting treasure hunts a disco and horse racing the kids were so busy we barely made it whole its been a wonderful trip with nice employees nice food and drink and wonderful memories thank you for a nice trip
a great way to go on holiday i cannot recommend the newcastle ijmuiden sailing enough rolled up at check in in newcastle straight onto the boat parked an in cabin within minutes clean cabin good beds and a decent nights sleep before starting our holiday compare that to the hell that is a british airport these days the entertainment in both bars was excellent and im sure the sky bar would be great on a nice summers night all the staff from check in on board and arrival were really friendly my only suggestion would be to improve the kids play area as its pretty small and not much there other than that a great service and we will definitely be back
perfect just got home after a mini cruise from copenhagen to oslo and back the following pluses cleaning perfect food at seas perfect good and large varied selection and tasty breakfast perfect nice big selection explores steakhouse perfect tasty service perfect all places completely through a nice experience suggestions would have liked a bench in the room for the suitcase option for a radiomusic in the room in the room we could have used an overview plan of the ship thanks again it was a wonderful trip in the most fantastic sailing weather
won a trip to the steakhouse and didnt have high expectations but all in all it was a nice trip a bit annoying to have to wait to get into oslo but otherwise fine
nice trip to oslo there is a great lack of information about having to set aside hours before you can come ashore due to checks and covid tests
a good trip with crown seaways this weekend its fine to have some more time on the ship now that it sails at can definitely be recommended
mini cruise to oslo fantastic trip rebooking times due to covid without problems really good service also on the trip smiling crew really good food not a finger to put on anything can be highly recommended
just went on a mini cruise with dfds crown seaways we had a golden wedding and had invited children and grandchildren along definitely a trip we received the best treatment everywhere on the ship all the staff without exception provided a fantastic service the food in the seven see restaurant was really delicious and again a super service some fantastic waiters was somewhat disappointed when our waiter who was completely unique brought chocolate and champagne as a gift from the ship thank you a lot for a wonderful trip we were all happy and satisfied we will be back soon mvh bente madsen
on we left kbh to oslo adults and children fantastic experience good food and good service it went so well this is not the last time we go on this trip it was our golden wedding we celebrated on this trip mr harry madsen
you are amazing you are indispensable in my chauffeur job have to sail with crown a few times a month and always look forward to it its always a pleasure you have so many good driver benefits and offers for drivers and you always ensure that we get really nice cabins as long as there are any available with you drivers are not just drivers thank you friendly and pleasant staff good food and a nice long time on board so you can get some rest great to finally sail again
super nice trip on the oslo boat we had got commodore rooms with a view it was super nice welcoming incoming staff and with good service and management the only downside was that in oslo we waited hours to get out of the terminal from the ferry so you didnt get as much time in oslo as expected so if you could now help to get out faster that would be super cool but other than that good food at the italy restaurant and an equally delicious breakfast with everything your heart desires
i have booked our honeymoon with departure on but as there was a change in the cabin i had to contact them by phone the day before departure i spoke to a really nice gabriel who was able to really put me at ease again as well as make sure the last things and changes were put in place never have i spoken to such an understanding and supportive person on the other side this is not our first trip but one of many and not our last either we look forward to tomorrow
i really enjoyed our trip to france last summer the ship was well managed in light of covid and we there was a free meal included which is always a bonus will travel with them again once it is allowed well priced
good trip apart from a lot of noise from cabin most of afternoon evening and night arabic language
this was a perfect trip for our overnight trip to oslo so that after breakfast we could continue the drive to our destination rested and relaxed we really enjoyed it
we had a good christmas trip where we were looked after and enjoyed
really good christmas trip despite corona restrictions
great trip everything in tip top delicious food smiling crew
as usual really good live musicians in the bar i was happy to play banko as a pastime when we couldnt get ashore
it was verry safty travel
a super nice and easy trip despite cov
lovely trip marred only by a very noisy travelling family food was very nice onboard good embarking and disembarking

we have just been on a new years cruise with stena sage but it was so unsatisfactory with their information and hospitality and their cabins are not at all what they write they should be so bad to spend your new year in
