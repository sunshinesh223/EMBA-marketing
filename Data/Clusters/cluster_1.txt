it was our first cruise a new experience it was simply fantastic a great ship good food contrary to our expectations no waiting times at the buffets well definitely be back next year
great vacation great service great cabin veranda great ship aidacosma excellent child care unfortunately the restaurants were quite full too many restaurants and the pools were quite crowded
priceperformance ratio is right and the staff is always friendly as a holidaymaker you always like to come back to one of the aida ships its like coming home
it is not good that aida ships are not yet smokefree the smoking areas on deck are disproportionately large nonsmokers are disadvantaged of the outdoor bars are designated as smoking areas aida ships are not recommended for nonsmokers nonsmoking protection is not enforced on aida ships
i would do it again in a heartbeat its in no way inferior to the american cruisers top service top catering top rooms top programi didnt miss anything aidastella
relaxed atmosphere on board with a good selection of food and drink the only annoying thing was the unnecessary announcements from the captain and cocaptain in the corridors early in the morning sometimes as early as which also woke you up absolute nonsense i want to wake up on my own and not to be woken up by meaningless greetings from the captain
aida cosma sun loungers are fully reserved at am and are not used for hours there are far too many smoking areas to get to the outside area of the yacht club you have to carry your food through the clouds of smoke at the lanai bar unpleasant smells urine in the stairwells toilets do not work properly vueling airline is catastrophic unable to allocate seats next to each other small children are placed away from the family between strangers cannot keep to their flight times delays on the outbound and return flights in the overheated plane you had to wait hours without drinks or fresh air because the plane did not take off
as explained in the previous questions aida employees were not friendly at all very rude especially the reception desk and house keeping french kiss restaurant employee as well
i am currently on a cruise in the mediterranean with my family everything is great so far there is one thing that is really annoying if i set up a quiet area with an age rating of i should also stick to it it must be possible to leave a small area of the ship to adults
aida absolutely top points deducted from the cosma ambience food long waiting times at the bars wellness overbooked better the smaller ships where quality counts more than quantity
nice staff delicious food great destinations the time slot for checking in is not so greatwhen you have to wait for hours after a long journey because its not your turn yet
everything worked out as described i found the trip very pleasant the staff was very friendly the quality of the food and drinks was also good we organized the city tours ourselves
aida has been ignoring the nonsmoking regulations on board for years guests are led through smoking areas to get to the bars or pool decks for example classic cocktails such as mojitos are now made with syrup instead of cane sugar lime and mint which doesnt taste good at all the food is top notch
the aidasensis cruise ship virus is very contagious aida tries to make the vacationers stay as comfortable as possible from the first moment to the last second friendly courteous staff anyone who has a question will be helped
it was only for german guests we austrians were not addressed at all
we traveled with aidaprima the ship was generally very clean the staff friendly but ive seen friendlier service the food was also the same in most of the restaurants that you didnt have to book for i expect different food in a market restaurant or a wider world restaurant that wasnt the case unfortunately we kept having a very unpleasant vibration in the entire cabin in our balcony cabin sometimes i couldnt sleep because it made me sick unfortunately no one responded to my complaints on board and i was dismissed afterwards by saying that it was normal on a ship but that is definitely not normal what a pity my yearold granddaughter felt very comfortable
it was a shame that there was no champagne reception with the captain which made the excursions so expensive cell phone package was also very expensive and there was no connection the evening shows were not so good anymore the staff were very friendly and tried very hard
i like traveling with aida and this time i hardly had any unpleasant nagging guests around me the staff on board are sensational
checkin in hamburg was almost unbearable with hours of queuing few staff and few seats poorly organized
you catch all kinds of diseases absolutely inconsiderate public drinking tourism too many guests this is not possible in restaurants from a hygiene point of view
aida prima from hamburg i really liked the trip itself the rooms were clean the food was good and there were many nice moments unfortunately the waiters only filled the drink glasses halfway and you always had to say something the last time they were extremely unfriendly with a drink for you can expect that it will at least be filled up to the top especially if there is still ice in it the cabin smelled very strongly of drains and in the dining areas it was unfortunately far too greasy in places the reception was also extremely unfriendly in places aida is still recommended but unfortunately the quality is declining you notice more and more that you are in a mass processing situation that is what it is but you shouldnt feel it so much
it was my first trip simply super the whole team was helpful and everyone was surrounded by friendliness as someone with allergies the food everywhere on the ship was just right all the offers were brilliant thank you to the whole crew i have booked again i will be back from the bottom of my heart and am already looking forward to the next trip thank you
we were on the aida cosma from june th to june nd meal times were too short for so many people absolute chaos never able to eat warm food ship already ruined and destroyed by the quotpeople who think theyre still in mallorcaquot it was sheer horror for us on the cosma i cant write as much as i could its better to burn money straight away its more pleasant we are absolutely dissatisfied unfortunately
we saw and experienced a lot the queues in the restaurants were very annoying
aida cosma very good but airline for arrival and departure very bad
made many new friends met nice people and always encountered friendly staff in the bella donna restaurant
the team on this ship is extremely friendly and everyone works with heart that really touched me
great value for money beautiful ship and great food super cleanliness and care
the trip and the cleanliness were great the food was in the upper good range the drinks and cocktails at the bars were a disgrace definitely dont book all inclusive
of us went on the day quotmediterranean treasuresquot tour with the aidacosma for all of us it was the first vacation withon a cruise ship so we have nothing to compare it to it was an eventful trip the ship offers everything you could wish for on a cruise the cabins are very well thought out lots of practical little things such as the clothesline in the shower storage space for suitcases under the bed in one of the cabins at the rear however water from the infinitive pool kept splashing onto the balcony since smoking is allowed on the balconies some of us unfortunately couldnt leave our balcony doors open because the smoke from neighboring balconies came in what a pity the ship was very clean the beds were always nicely decorated the staff were very nice apart from a few waitresses at the bars the food in all restaurants was good to very good unfortunately the wifi that we used to communicate with each other was often unstable we then walked many kilometers to find each other what unfortunately didnt work out was the small group supervision although we were assured several times when booking months before the start of the trip that we would receive group supervision in advance no one got in touch despite repeated inquiries about months before the start of the trip we were told that the supervision of small groups had been changed and could only begin on the ship we were mainly looking for support with table reservations as we wanted to find space in buffet restaurants with people and meeting the contact person was not that easy unfortunately we also did not receive the file of our group photo included in the small group to this day unfortunately the reception was often staffed with staff who spoke german or english but unfortunately did not understand the contentmeaning of the questions and could not make themselves understood this is unpleasant for both the staff and the guests however everyone was nice and helpful two of our participants were unable to take part in an excursion due to a bad cold and even though it was requested days in advance the trip could not be rebooked for other family members and it could not be cancelled either but had to be paid in full and this despite the fact that there was apparently a waiting list for the trip
compared to my previous aida trips the service has deteriorated somewhat cabin service coffee in the afternoon aida flyer in the cabin today
the guest always comes first everything is done to ensure that the guest has a happy time on board
for the first time at sea it was very stressfree and well organized
the service on board and the food
best cruise operator top crew top food and great routes for us it can only be said aida the only criticism aidas excursions are very expensive you can often get the same excursions much cheaper through thirdparty providers
it was bad that the bar menu was changed in the middle of our trip
be sure to check out the new bar menu and maybe go back to the old one the readymade mixes from johns can be used at home but not on a cruise the dried decorative fruit slices look like cardboard
the trip was perfectly organized very relaxed atmosphere on board everyone is in a good mood great sophisticated evening shows food in the buffets is first class absolutely something for everyone cabins are very well equipped
nice staff cool captain and a nice trip ship was clean and nice
unfortunately the mass of people which leads to a totally overcrowded ship no seats in the restaurantbarsswimming pool etc long waits at the barselevators does not create a holiday atmosphere or relaxation
unfriendly and incompetent staff drinks were not available or were prepared incorrectly minute wait at the street food corner for a kebab that was not even remotely a real kebab the bread is more cake than bread casino is more of a slot machine hall than a real casino food in buffet restaurant is like canteen food a la carte mini portions only the speciality restaurant was very good with the massages it depends extremely on the mood of the employee we booked two identical massages each and both times we noticed massive differences in the extent of the massage afterwards i like cruises but not with aida anymore
we have been on an aida ship for the th time this time it was the cosma a very beautiful ship cleanliness friendliness food everything was top notch we are huge aida fans and will go again what we dont understand is that you have to pay for the cake and coffee in the afternoon yourself we find that disgraceful so much is spent on good food a cup of coffee should also be included in the afternoon
i didnt like the service and organization i really liked the staff because they were very friendly
staff more unfriendly and unmotivated than ever i have never experienced this before from previous trips suitcases were so damaged when we left that we had to throw them away compensation was a joke we were offered vouchers for a ridiculous amount instead of money then it was sold in such a way that we should not tell other guests because it would be such a great gesture but that is not how customer service works we have decided that we will not travel with aida again it is a shame
i was happy with the aidasol with the food with the filipino staff i was very dissatisfied with the excursions too expensive and the bus seats were much too narrow they should have been star buses not acceptable for older people
very nice crew very clean cabin and comfortable beds
great ship lots to experience nice crew unfortunately there were a lot of small children throwing up in the restaurant and a lot of passengers with stomachintestinal problems on the nova
the many passengers did not attract attention on the ship
everything was great price service food cleanliness
aidanova is much too big not enough to offer for too many people hardly any dancing opportunities brewery too small no space to dance standardlatin almost impossible deck beach club is just a fidgeting hall uncomfortable casino tiny that was the last time i went on aida if at all then only small ships
we have avoided aida so far because we dont like the buffet restaurant concept but we wanted to give aida a chance and we love cruises because you can visit lots of places in a short space of time without having to live out of a suitcase a nice dinner followed by entertainment or dancing with a nice cocktail or glass of wine rounds off a great day of vacation for us we were on the diva from june st to june th first we went from warnemnde to norway after another stopover in various baltic sea towns the first part of the trip was very scenic even if the weather wasnt great but thats not aidas fault the buffet restaurants were also very busy in the first part of the trip but in our second week it was abysmal the first guests were already standing in front of the restaurants at pm which opened at pm this is certainly due to the guests but in our opinion also to the concept on previous cruises we had the choice between a buffet and a fullservice restaurant although you were tied to specific times the buffet restaurants on our other trips were open almost all day which also spread out the crowds we missed that on aida in addition some of the warm dishes were cold as an alternative we went to the almhtte the service was great but the choice of food was limited you can also eat well in the buffalo or the rossini but you have to pay for it in our opinion the free drinks during meal times are the reason for the crowds in the buffet restaurants and when meal times end in the market restaurant even the drinks are poured into bottles that you have brought with you that doesnt give us a holiday feeling the excursions are unfortunately overpriced when you see the prices on site on a longer excursion you can buy a packed lunch that should be included in the price especially since you cant take part in the meal we booked all inclusive but still found the prices for cocktails to be overpriced no original ingredients syrup and dried fruit still between and eur on sea days we recommend the wellness suite very quiet wonderful breakfast although more expensive unfortunately we were not able to enjoy all the events in the theatrium the annoying reservation hours in advance unfortunately also here you could also watch the show on the tv but that is not the same the shows especially the singing by the crew and the shark bar were great all in all we experienced a lot but the muchpraised smile moment was missing except as mentioned the wellness suite but we paid extra for that we can imagine traveling with aida again if the route is great but we cannot agree with the opinion of many others that only and always aida
we give it stars three too bad and four too good a lot of things on the ship are a matter of luck waiting or not friendly staff or pedantic free seats on the open decks or not incredible range of top quality food without the allinclusive drinks package you are limited entertainment and ambience are top notch the included coffee is just not good
food service organization everything was top notch unfortunately there were a few too many guests on board
very good food and a wide selection
food at the buffet was ok but very simple comparable to the level of very good company canteens compared to a year ago it was even lower restaurants with service included are of better quality but can only be booked by a fraction of travelers restaurants with additional charges such as the steakhouse and rossini gourmet are impeccable cocktails have been downgraded for example instead of brown cane sugar as they should be now only sugar syrup in some cases there are blatant hygiene deficiencies after a massive outbreak of gastroenteritis it took two whole days before measures were taken by then the number of people affected had risen exponentially and the hospital was making a killing that is negligent cabin staff and reception were always impeccable as were the waiters excursions were excessively expensive checkin and checkin were good
the staff who were super friendly and helpful and always made sure everything was clean deserve stars there are only because unfortunately there is no separation of smoking and nonsmoking cabins some passengers have no manners the typical practice of reserving loungers with towels which are not used for hours
unfortunately poor hygiene ruined the vacation no refund from aida additional quarantine was required otherwise good trip and beautiful ship if you want to dance youre in the wrong place here max space for couples although the dance lessons are great the cocktails arent worth the money and are simply poured together without a measure the shows were mostly good when booking time machine make sure you book a seat near the stage otherwise you wont see anything
complete package of arrival life on board excursions food artist performances departure package is right
a week in norway with masses of children aged the aida nova is even described by fellow travelers as a childrens ship no restaurant just for adults no place to retreat other than the cabin no pool that wasnt packed with children and their parents food either cold or lukewarm balcony cabins too small even for two slim women subterranean entertainment theatrium like a train station hall with bustling passengers children and waiters aida trips were constantly being advertised norovirus on board unnecessary things like iris photography and art galleries shops overpriced almost euros for nivea shampoo
unfortunately we were unable to reach a port during our stay we also got stomach and intestinal problems like many of the people on board unfortunately we were left in isolation in a cabin without a windowbalcony we had requested a cabin change from the start because of seasickness we didnt get one but days later i heard from various people who had received one there are plenty of events and activities on board as well as restaurants
very friendly staff courteous clean rooms generally very clean thats how vacation should be
aidacosma from june th to june th the hour wellness suite and our cabin were positive both in terms of equipment and location of the cabin but that was it escaping the media is not possible qr code cell phone always with you is the motto mass processing like i have never experienced before and i have traveled a lot also with my granddaughters poor app that only works on board if you want to find out about the return journey to the port during an excursion for example the app doesnt work on land some information is only available on the tv if you dont switch it on by chance you miss important information because you cant hear the announcements in the cabin for for two people with child its not worth the price unfriendly staff mostly asians who dont speak german or english no instructions or information when boarding having to find your own cabin annoying discussions with aida staff or not blue aida jacket didnt want to tell me her name endless waiting times no matter where reception no free seats at mealtime mushy pasta and chips no seasonal fruit but granny smith from china everything overly sweetened powdered juices and uncouth guests with no manners no restaurant without screaming children everything was hopelessly overcrowded including the bars nontransparent drink packages comfort didnt even include aperol or spritzer everything was badly organized no supervision in the childrens play area the photo flat rate was free no one was ever there first they said it would be from pm then from pm blatant disregard for data protection photo selection via selfservice and facial recognition which is totally faulty so i can order photos of any person at the end they said you had to order them days before the end apart from the fact that only photo was taken when boarding we would have had to go looking for the photographer again queue up again the excursions were overpriced and terrible in pisa we were chased from the bus to the tower in a constant run quotshould i speak english or read germanquot was the tour guides question you didnt understand either one or the other hour tour of course with waiting no time for coffee or toilet except in corsica bernhard was great in barcelona they charged per person for the aida shuttle from the port to the trade center so with the taxi back to the ship we paid booking the massage in the wellness area because thats not possible in the app you have to get bathrobes from reception so go back wait complaints were ignored or at reception they said quotwrite an email to the people up therequot a complete disaster from start to finish never again on such a big ship and never again all inclusive
the trip on the aida was ok unfortunately the absence of all the managers was a bit negative for me and even after asking several times at the reception questions were not answered so there is definitely still a lot to improve
totally disappointed the restaurants were totally overcrowded and loudtable reservations not possible i wont go on holiday with aida again others can do it better
all in all a very nice holiday with aida nova but it is a disaster to get a free table in the buffet restaurants as the guests only sit there to drink their free coffee or wine this definitely needs to be changed
very well organized varied food great staff great routes priceperformance ratio is right
very nice rooms everything on the whole ship is always extremely clean great restaurants and bars and everyone is super friendly
ship stay was good and staff very nice food was good shows and booking restaurants very good unfortunately the quotentertainment managerquot always had to interrupt the meal in the morning and at lunchtime in the restaurants they could have done without these quotunimportantquot announcements as you can hear the noise everywhere nd negative point are the excursions things are advertised that are not so and are usually overpriced
an inside cabin with an additional foldout bed on the wall so that the space between this and the bed was only enough for petite very slim people to be able to use the bed themselves which meant that the beds were pushed against a wall and my husband had to crawl into bed on all fours that might be acceptable when youre young but not at our age the drinks package was not fully usable because the ingredients were missing too few staff food was consistently cold in the buffet restaurants
check in was really good this time aidaprima is great aida has become far too expensive far too many people on boardrestaurants noise level is generally too loud which makes passengers nervous always happy to go with children
cabins even veranda comfort not great service staff excellent food good average avoid buffet restaurants in the rossini
we booked a panorama cabin on deck with access to the patio deck as we had rain on days of our route of course aida cant do anything about that and we only noticed on board that the balcony on deck and the patio deck were not covered neither the balcony nor the patio deck were usable according to reception on the aidaprima it was not possible to rebook to a quotnormalquot balcony cabin a complaint to aida customer service was dismissed with the answer that we should have found out about the condition of the cabin before the trip it was our own fault we have already taken several trips with aida and planned new trips for this year and next year but that is no longer the case there are other shipping companies that was not customer loyalty aida once the money has been received this companys customer friendliness ends never again aida
good value for money room keeping was very good cleanliness on the ship was good the service in the restaurants was good but there was room for improvement in the bars the leisure activities on board activitiesspa were good and varied
first cruise with aida before that other shipping companies and sea areas veranda cabin with lounge big enough but the balcony built in meant that other peoples ashes were visible on the balcony and from above and the foil meant that there was no direct view of the water through the window the first week of the trip was still pentecost holidays with noisy young people in the neighboring cabin who thought they had to sing russian folk songs loudly at am doors slammed shut several times during the night always recommend checking the onboard bill on the second day the steak restaurant charged us a generous tip of euros without us having personally been to the restaurant with our card unfortunately we had to cancel the table for that evening but in time it was definitely possible to reassign it in my opinion this is fraud by the staff the amount has been corrected lots of children screaming and running around unsupervised at the evening events who thought they had to outdo the firstclass artists program in terms of volume waiters were almost knocked over with full trays but parents werent interested the second week of the cruise was much quieter clear recommendation to avoid holiday periods if you like things a little quieter we luckily only had to visit listless waiters in the fuego restaurant once after an excursion the other buffet restaurants had very good quality food hardworking service staff seat reservations for the flight via aida worked on the outbound flight but unfortunately not on the return flight nobody there knew anything about it the guests outfits were surprisingly good apart from a few special cases however when making a reservation in the la carte restaurant the restaurant manager should simply send back guests who for example turn up in flipflops and short swim shorts at the oceans unfortunately my husband prevented me from speaking to the man in flipflops and shorts in person but i should have done so if his wife didnt know if you dont have long trousers with you perhaps because your luggage was lost you can go to other restaurants checkin in mallorca was surprisingly all in english for my husband so if you dont understand that you should be prepared for it despite a tip our cabin service forgot to change the towels twice and changed the bed linen twice on their own initiative but left out the pillows each time the outdoor bars were always sparsely staffed perhaps for business reasons you sometimes had to wait a long time for drinks or so we ended up looking for an indoor bar very nice cruise director tom with entertaining episodes in the evening program highly recommended booked organized excursions nothing to complain about several on our own the ships furnishings are new and of high quality for the boutiques i dont want the fashion lines that are already in all the shopping centers such as brax etc i was more impressed by the tui fleet and norwegian cruise line in terms of fashion then you feel like browsing there the tour of the kitchen was very interesting and is recommended
just returned from cruise with the aida bella to norway and north cape great weather previously with the same company and cruise to dubai everything was taken care of in tip top condition neatly clean food fantastic the destinations were changed one day due to weather conditions captain himself explained how and why unfortunately we were unable to go to lofoten the next day as an alternative it became bergen perfect in short next time again
actually nothing because nobody can do anything about the bad weather
that everyone on the ship sticks together in such a friendly and peaceful manner it is particularly important to promote and further develop environmental protection
both at pm and at am the disinfectant dispensers in the elevator corridors and restaurants were all empty this is unacceptable especially at a time when hygiene is of utmost importance
smooth organization checkin checkout shore excursions without long waiting times or excessive activity pure relaxation
a very varied holiday at a high sometimes very high level not only the opportunity to get to know many cities but also the many options on board in addition clean attentive staff delicious food drinks from brand manufacturers
top organization perfect catering feel good
it seems to be nothing new for aida that people feel bothered by noise when there are small children or babies next to them in the cabin they are actually so insensitive to this that they cant take any consideration of those who arent sleeping and are more in favor of families they offer you a night where you can go in late at night to sleep and have to leave early in the morning funnily enough they are free but there is no exchange cabin for me that is an absolute nono to booking again because as a passenger you are apparently worth nothing and according to aida you should actually enjoy the days events and not think about the sleepless nights
the crews organization and logistics are impressive
the wonderful service of the entire crew
we travelled with the prima cabin service staff entertainment food and drinkseverything got full marks from us we will travel with the aida again
everything was very nice for me and my granddaughter only the weather was not great but unfortunately there is nothing we can do about that
good value for money cleanliness and service on board good friendly motivated staff motto quotyoure on holidayquot and that is usually fulfilled and of course very good and varied food sports activities afterwards available for everyone overall recommended
the relaxed atmosphere on board
beautiful ship and very good restaurants
the side sleeper pillow that was ordered was not taken into account the opening times of the restaurants were inconsistent with the excursions the food in the restaurants was often only lukewarm even if the restaurant had only just opened overall the aidabella is showing its age excursions are overpriced room service was very good all the staff were very friendly and helpful a waste of money
if bookings are cancelled other excursions are booked without consultation these must be cancelled promptly this does not always work we had to go to the excursion department twice to cancel this causes stress on holiday i had an allinclusive drinks menu weeks before the start of the trip the drinks were emailed to me for information however these drinks were not available on board statement from the bar the menu had been changed the drink that i then drank was also empty during the trip absolutely unprofessional the show had to be interrupted due to technical problems everything at the buffet was lukewarm and partly too salty
we would have hoped for more childfriendliness lack of changing facilities in the public areas no stools in the toilets to help with hand washing lack of activities for children who do not want toare not allowed to go to the mini club it would be desirable to have a small play area outside the mini club for example as the mini club is closed to other children while children aged and over are being looked after mini disco was spontaneously cancelled of course a big disappointment for the child on some days there was a lack of quotchildfriendlyquot food eg very simple dishes like chips and nuggets
i did not like the quality of cabin as well as the noisy children
from checkin to checkout everything was very well organized excellent food in the a la carte restaurants very friendly and helpful staff our kf and are already booked again once aida always aida
aida cosma a floating and very well organized skyscraper to have everything under control with this crowd applause
the times of arrival and departure were stated in advance at many ports aida had no idea what to do the food was cold the cocktail was made with too much ice so that it only tasted like water the food was often cold the spa was very unfriendly there was supposed to be off excursions one was cancelled by aida and we could have booked an alternative but we wouldnt have gotten the off
aida is always nice but the allround package food sauna port location was more customeroriented in the s
was here last month and booked again but forgot to leave my review it was really nice from the cleanliness of the cabin to the individual restaurants and the food wonderful
a suite breakfast cannot and must not take place in the casa nova or french kiss where hundreds of people flock to a buffet restaurant for breakfast in the past a suite breakfast would be in the steakhouse or the rossini an appropriate atmosphere for the hefty surcharge that a suite guest pays i am writing this annoyed after our th trip with aida
very well organized so that there is no frustration on arrival and departure extensive cultural program advance information about the shore excursions should be repeated at different times absolutely delicious food the tour of the kitchen showed the high quality standard
everything was very clean and the staff was great unfortunately the ship was too big for us although it is a great ship we like the smaller aida ships better especially diva stella and blue
great food great staff beautiful views from the ship
always an experience well organized super friendly staff food is simply great and everything is spotlessly clean always happy to come back
drinks are far too expensive and below average no fresh cocktails or long drinks for example syrup is used instead of fresh limes there is no mint in the hugo no berries in the lillet wildberry food is ok at best all in all disappointing too expensive and not recommended
we were on a cruise ship for the first time in mayjune with the aidacosma and the expected quality of the ship with everything it has to offer was fully confirmed out of stars super cleanliness super service super condition and quality what surprised us the most the high proportion of young and very young people with and without childrentoddlers on the ship that completely changed our view of a cruise well do it again next year
completely satisfied everyone gets their moneys worth the staff is super friendly the food is wonderful and everything else is tip top ill be back
the quality is noticeably declining especially in the bars but also in the buffet restaurants
we traveled as a family on the aida cosma in the mediterranean first of all the positive points the food and drinks were excellent our inside cabin was fine the ship was in very good condition overall now for the negative points that led to the negative rating the ship was extremely overcrowded you could never actually find an empty elevator and often there was no room left the buffet restaurants were also always absurdly full and in the evenings you sometimes couldnt even get a table the service was rather mixed some employees were very friendly others were annoyed or even rude to the guests some of the things we ordered in advance were not in the cabin as promised when we moved into it the aida baby monitor is useless at all it has a range of a few meters so you can be outside the cabin but only in the hallway with the other cabins on the same deck accordingly the baby monitor clearly failed to serve its purpose complaints about this are unfortunately treated very disparagingly by aida customer service unfortunately we did not receive a refund for the baby monitor which we had to pay for without the baby monitor i would have considered another trip with aida but now that is probably no longer an option
very friendly staff clean great service very good food well seasoned
aida sol world tour we were really looking forward to the world tour we had saved up for this trip for a long time but it was a flop of the year after approx week on november th it started grinding noises hammering knocking scratching noises as if you were standing in a metalworking shop and the worker next to you was hitting the anvil this went on for months it started at am and ended around pm we complained several times at the reception but nothing helped we would have liked to take a different cabin the hotel managers answer came promptly if we pay euros extra they would have a different cabin aida sol has space for around people but there were only on board who were the remaining rooms for we can say it was for the aida workers otherwise they would not have been able to make such a noise all windows were not cleaned for months there were workers at work on every deck loudspeakers didnt work the stage in the theatrium was broken seating during dinner was a lottery game aida sol was in dry dock for this actually wanted to enjoy the roundtheworld trip but that wasnt the case from february th after another hotel manager came on board and we filed another complaint we received a message from the new manager telling the boatswain to stop the noise pollution it was successful after days this ship aida sol belongs in the ship graveyard
the ship is simply too big there is hardly any possibility of getting a seat in the restaurants that are advertised on sea days there is no place for a family to lie down in the late morning the bars are completely overwhelmed and understaffed on sea days aida cosma never again all the others the size of aida diva are very happy
very nice harbors friendly staff good food
pleasant atmosphere familyfriendly super friendly service staff and consistently great food cleanliness is a top priority nice cabins balcony with hammock used extensively during the daily sunsets good engaging show program
i was travelling with aida cosma far too full people gourmets from ballermann no organisation the main thing is that the ship is full and selling alcohol ruins the reputation i paid far too much for this trip it wasnt worth it no sleep young people paid a week ago the main thing is that its not full just drunk bad behaviour no one paid attention staff totally overwhelmed with passengers i wouldnt recommend it and i never want to travel with aida again antisocial
greetings from ballermannif thats what you want youve come to the right place broken glasses in the anytime bar area in the elevator glasses and bottles left everywhere party guests walking through the decks with glasses men coming to dinner in shorts and even bathrobes with a beer glass in their hand nothing was done about it adulterated drinks served in canisters at quothappy hourquot timeand much more that was our last tour on the aida its good that there are still providers with style and class
cabin much too small long wait for drinks at the bars cocktails without fresh fruit and decoration
organisation food cleanliness great very few free activities dancing not possible at all despite a live band disco only crazy loud blaring music dancing was not possible either these events start at pm far too late uncomfortable aida bar because the pool is included older people only had the option of getting information about the programme and onboard bill via the app quiz also via the app many people are excluded as a result there were also dance courses for advanced dancers sometimes but during our excursion times
we had a great holiday we saw a lot and the excursions were great we had a room with a sea view which was actually very spacious and always super clean the shows in the evening were just great high praise only the dinner always stressed me out we were looking for a table every evening and there was always a crowd at the buffet there is still room for improvement in terms of gastronomy especially with the desserts the food is my only criticism the service was always good when clearing away even at the bars but ordering was usually difficult i dont know that from the other ship there the guest always had priority and service was always present
a pleasant atmosphere on board vacationers should actually be trained to contribute to this personally many vacationers only know each other pushing at the buffet overcrowding the elevator reserving sun loungers reserving seats are some of the bad habits that reduce the vacation experience everyone has to take responsibility for themselves
all the staff on the ship are sooooo friendly thank you for the great time
the staff is very friendly and helpful the buffet food could sometimes be better booked excursions are okay but a bit expensive there is nothing to complain about when it comes to the cleanliness on the ship
i felt well received nice service staff helpfulness and good food
plagued and vacation ruined by ki thank god met nice employees and nice people
positives excellent service friendly cheerful service staff good food buffet almost completely refilled until the end varied selection of restaurants and bars lots of leisure activities clean surroundings unfortunately not so positive some organized excursions too expensive sometimes even outrageously overpriced eg glass bottom boat per person aida selforganization too many guests for the capacity in restaurants and on deck seats for breakfast dinner loungers on sea days unused loungers are not cleared towels
my very expensive drinks package was worthless because i didnt get a single reservation in a restaurant aidas response to this feedback none at all as a customer i could hardly feel less valued and ripped off
very good crew good cooperation very committed to providing cleanliness and good food for the number of people
the entire short cruise package was perfect the prices for food and drinks are on a par with mainland prices and even lower
service is generally annoyed by their job ordering drinks on board can take up to minutes for the drink to arrive while youre sitting at the bar food at street food stands usually arrives cold as up to dishes are often prepared in advance its rare that you dont hear annoyed groans from employees when they have to clear empty drinks or similar from tables of employees dont understand orders or blindly ignore half of them and only fulfill them completely if you remain sittingstanding at the bar or street food stand in general employees seem forced and annoyed at having to do their job i absolutely didnt expect that given the high price of the trip on top of that the ship docks in an industrial port and youre basically forced to use one of their shuttles for per person or walk h m to town and back when the docking time is just h
unfortunately it was very loud there is hardly any place to retreat where you can relax on sea days there are separate meal times but families do not use them small children years are in the dining room even after pm getting a table that had already been cleared and cleaned was lucky a table for people was occupied by people and child when we asked if there was still space we were told no we were on board from may th to may st we were not able to use the pool or the whirlpool even once both were in the hands of children the best loungers were already occupied by their mothers with towels in the morning the room staff were topnotch the service staff totally overwhelmed we had to wait up to minutes for a drink i was on the aida mar once before in and was thrilled its sad that so little consideration is shown for fellow travelers who want to enjoy their vacation
we were glad when we left the ship and wouldnt do a cruise like that again even if it were free veranda cabin it certainly had nothing to do with the relaxation we were longing for a pure fight at the buffet and for tables so that we couldnt leave the table in pairs to go to the buffet sometimes there was no table at all or guests refused to sit down when the waiter asked neither at the buffet nor in the specialty restaurant and that for a trip for which we paid several thousand euros it was no different with the berths everything was reserved in the morning and the seats in the theatrium and we didnt even go into the overcrowded minipools we are now sick after the trip and all the people who coughed and sneezed and who you could hardly avoid and who didnt particularly adhere to the hygiene regulations the mediterranean cruise on the aida cosma was a nightmare for us i positively rate the friendly mainly filipino staff who spoke german more or less poorly but were very nice as well as the fitness area the starbucks and the art bar
scandinavia with aida mar days with great weather the staff were great always friendly despite being totally understaffed the crowds at the bars were almost unbearable the food in the buffet restaurants was good although we found it more varied on the nova although there were not even half the passengers on the mar we found the meals unrelaxing in our opinion the mar has too few restaurants that are included in the price and many passengers seem to think they will starve if they dont rattle on the door minutes before opening but of course aida cant do anything about that despite everything it was a wonderful trip we would happily go again but would prefer to go on the larger aida ships with more options and variety
it was our first trip everything was very good on the ship everyone was polite and accommodating the excursions were also well organized the trip to paris had one drawback the guide explained the sights to us on the bus in paris we went on a tour of the seine with food unfortunately we were not told what sights we were going to see instead they were busy serving the food which was not worth the price many children who were with us only ate the bread rolls you should take that into account when ordering but otherwise it was a nice trip thank you very much and keep it up
travelled on the aida cosma in the mediterranean positive nice trip everything went well onboard offerings food was good everything was clean at all times negative standard coffee in the onboard restaurants is brown water and tasteless we booked a large drinks package but unfortunately we couldnt use it in the speciality restaurants because they were all fully booked thats a cheek no chance on board either in the cabin there was unfortunately some black mould in the shower that can be cleaned if youre looking for peace and quiet while eating in the buffet restaurants youre out of luck in my opinion these are overcrowded its also very busy at offpeak times ordering drinks in the bars there were sometimes very long waiting times or sometimes the order was forgotten in the buffet restaurants the waiters also made very different efforts to clear the full tables of previous guests so we often had to ask for the table to be cleaned the service staff including those in ships uniform were also relatively unfriendly often no quotgood morningquot no hello and at the busy bar you are often simply ignored these little things spoil a cruise all in all i would say that the aida is more or less the same as ikea lots of people get through relatively quickly and anonymously but the quality is generally ok
its a shame that the service staff in the buffet restaurants are so unmotivated there is still room for improvement but overall all the employees are very nice and polite
it is very important to me that the onboard staff is clean and friendly as was the case on this trip thank you
very friendly staff and high quality and cleanliness on board unfortunately there were too many passengers for the onboard offerings sunbed reservations by towel from early morning to late evening restaurants fully booked before departure
food very varied and delicious staff super friendly and welcoming value for money super fair a very successful holiday thank you
service crew at many bars unfriendly bar is poorly organized overpriced shore excursions
the crew was very committed and always present the service was very friendly and hardworking the bathroom was always cleaned my husband and i were very satisfied
great service very entertaining on the trip lots of variety great varied program top culinary
food is great the rest doesnt suffer
great service great offers on board and really impressively good quality of food you really are spoiled for choice in a week
not enough staff for the number of passengers bad service at the bars overcrowded ship
due to the lack of childcare we were unable to use all of the services even when swimming we had to keep an eye on our child years old the whole time as the water was too deep at m the childcare options are inadequate the carers seemed very strict our child did not feel comfortable at all we only used the sauna twice at an additional cost
the service at the outdoor bars leaves a lot to be desired you have to wait far too long for drinks this needs some improvement
after several tours we are now considering using a different provider in all these years we have never had a really hot lunch always just lukewarm the same goes for english breakfast
super friendly crew whether at the bars or in the restaurant everyone is very nice helpful and courteous in general everything is very clean and you have the opportunity to try new dishes at the buffet
everything was great the ship the people the staff a huge thank you
not recommended the crew itself is really super nice but on the aida nova everything is far too crowded when eating you always have to wait forever until a table becomes free when taking the elevator it also takes forever until one comes and the food and entertainment programs are really not good for the money
it was our first cruise and we enjoyed it the food and drinks were very good the staff were exceptionally friendly the offersshows on the ship were very good since two federal states were on vacation it was very crowded and often loud
we had booked a junior suite on the aida cosma but the cabin was very small and the priceperformance ratio was not right the internet didnt work a lot of things cost extra even though we had booked the premium package we sometimes had to wait half an hour for drinks the selection of drinks left a lot to be desired the food in the restaurants was great we wont be traveling with aida anymore you get more for your money with other shipping companies
lots of restaurants bars and entertainment on board definitely interesting for families there were guests with us including children on board just too many people for me i wont be a fan of the big ships unless they are sailing on a route that i really want to do
there was often just a sales event on board
fantastic and great appreciation for the employees even the captain is not portrayed as a puppet for some event which is the case with other cruise companies but is seen in his real role
aida tries to take money out of guests pockets at every turn excursions are booked through local providers and then resold at a markup in smaller towns it is no longer possible to organize excursions yourself the cocktails are also no longer as good as they used to be and have become extremely expensive
despite the large number of guests on board we felt very spoiled with our beautiful cabin the friendly crew the highquality food the show program and also the many sports opportunities the norwegian fjords are unique and we were very lucky to experience them with lots of sunshine impressions that we will never forget
everything is well organized and always concerned about the wellbeing of the guests
it was our first cruise and we were very excited to see what awaited us we would have liked a little more time to see the sights on the excursions we had booked unfortunately you have to book the onboard restaurants in advance from home in order to use them flexibility would be desirable so there is room for improvement
we returned from our cruise on aida cosma a few days ago and i would like to describe the shocking experience the ships capacity is not even close to the number of passengers allowed on board the berths on the decks seats for the entertainment program theatrium and tables in the buffet restaurants are not even enough for a third of the passengers the majority of passengers spent every day at sea running around the decks looking for loungers seats or other suitable places to sit constant jostling and arguments over free seats were the order of the day in the buffet restaurants you had to literally squeeze through the crowd and stand in line finding a free table after five rounds was like winning the lottery the atmosphere was so tense due to the lack of space that some people almost fought over a free table in our opinion it is an absolute disgrace to cram the ship so full of people that a reasonable stay is no longer possible it is the shipping companys binding duty to calculate the seating capacity and the number of seats sold in such a way that guests still have a halfway reasonable stay it cannot be that guests who have paid so much money for these few days of relaxation are claustrophobic every day and have to fight for free tables as parents of a schoolage child we usually travel in overcrowded resorts holiday time but we have never experienced a disproportionateness of this magnitude absolute disgrace we have already sent a complaint email to aida customer service the response was an obviously dismissive standardized email thats how much value is placed on feedback
the aida is not bad but it is also not particularly good for the price if you want to go on a cruise you can do it with the aida the important thing is that you approach it with realistic expectations the food is average everything from very good to adequate is there there are good days and bad days to be fair it cant be much better on average after all it is a very large canteen and not a restaurant it is massproduced unfortunately the selection of cocktails has been significantly worse since than it used to be back then the aida was excellent in its huge selection of cocktails now there are only a few half are inhouse creations only a few of which are good i asked several bartenders independently of one another why the menu had been changed so much the mood went from friendly to depressed every time obviously there is pressure from above to sell the new menu as something good requests outside of the menu are not possible even though the spirits are available and the old cocktails are still in the system the best example is the white russian kahla is available but it is not used in any of the cocktails nevertheless it is not allowed to be served not even if you want to pay for it voluntarily i found out that they are trying to build a backtotheroots image with the new cocktails only those who think they are experts can be fooled by this with the exception of the trader vics mai tai and the white basil they are no good however all the cocktails are still expertly made so it is not the quality of the spirits or the bartenders it is simply the poor selection i cannot understand why they do this there would be no financial disadvantage for aida to have a wider range the comfort drinks package used to be worthwhile that is no longer the case anyone under who has already booked the drinks flat rate has to pay an additional on board to get alcohol and coffee absurdly once youve paid the you dont get any cocoa i advise anyone not to book the drinks package unless they want to drink excessively beer and wine blends are free at the buffet anyway the lunch times may correspond to the usual german lunch times but they are extremely impractical if you want to eat lunch after going ashore you then have to go to either the burger restaurant or the brewery both become very monotonous in the long run the security checks after going ashore are purely an alibi you can save yourself that the detector beeped every time for me in of all cases the crew didnt notice in the other cases i was frisked without even bothering the prices for aida additional bookings on land are horrendous we traveled by bus and train instead the tickets cost per person there and back equivalent aida bookings cost the payment system on board is outdated every guest has a card with a barcode to order a drink the barcode is scanned each time then the device is tapped wildly to find the drink and a signature is requested aida should switch to nfc and develop a modern ordering system app furthermore the signature offers no advantage the bartenders who you get on well with sign the card themselves anyway to speed things up some bartenders allow orders for two people on one card some dont
the destinations were ok we go on cruises several times a year this time the customer service was absolutely zero rude staff there was no real holiday atmosphere
it was another lovely trip unfortunately the new drinks that were advertised ran out after days new drinks menu this shouldnt happen it was my th cruise and it would be better if some people would rather spend their holidays at home not recommended for families i would choose a new ship
a completely satisfactory holiday cabin food cleanliness offers everything was perfect i would particularly like to mention the child and family friendliness of all the staff and the provider starting with the small surcharge per child on the travel price to the childcare which our child loved the only drawback in my opinion is that the excursions are very expensive but you dont have to book them and you still get to see beautiful cities
the aidadiva was extremely clean and in very good condition the buffet restaurants were all very busy at all times the food especially the vegetables and pasta was overcooked and far too spicy there was hardly a quiet corner outside so you could hardly enjoy the cruise experience in peace the service at the bars was very mixed sometimes quick sometimes you were ignored for minutes all in all next time ill spend a few euros more and go with tui cruises
these are mostly buffet restaurants but they are set in a nice comfortable restaurant very far from a canteen feeling
we were on the aida nova the ship is very well equipped it is very large and has a lot of guests but that doesnt happen on the ship we had good weather and the guests were often on deck i cant say what its like when it rains the food as an inclusive service in the specialty restaurants not la carte restaurants was very tasty you just have to reserve a table there early
everything was interesting and delicious
the new bar menu is simply a significant deterioration
overcrowded too many people crowds everywhere standing in line no space hidden additional costs water in the cabin is charged per bottle even though the drinks package is included
i wouldnt do it again too crowded often there was no seat free on deck just stressful
some passengers behaving badly especially in the restaurant area
as a couple we booked a veranda cabin plus ai and definitely expected more for the price and that was the most expensive vacation we have ever planned for a week when we checked in we were full of anticipation and then suddenly found ourselves on deck with no plan nobody was there to tell us where to go you really feel lost in such a huge bunker on the first evening in the yacht club my husband wanted a beer with dinner but there was only wine and water and he had to go and tap his own beer but only foam comes out of the taps there is hardly any staff to take drinks and even if you go to the bar yourself in the evening it takes up to minutes to get your drink restaurants in the buffet restaurants the food is lukewarm and booking in the specialty restaurants is not possible at all for a weeks vacation because many guests seem to reserve everything before they start their vacation in addition the specialty restaurants are very inconveniently located the main path to the buffet restaurants or the theatrium goes right through the restaurants the noise and the atmosphere make it feel like a train station and we didnt want to try the la carte restaurants that you could book because the holiday was expensive enough for us and we thought we would find the right one with the other restaurant options aida should prevent the option of reserving these before the trip begins for newcomers who dont know the concept its just annoying in the specialty restaurants brauhaus and east that can be used without booking you feel like you have to apologize no bon appetit no question about whether you enjoyed it nothing if you come from the hotel and catering industry and know it its simply a nogo and the only people who said quotwelcomequot were the crew member at checkin and tom at his prime time thats a shame and often its the little things that make you feel welcome its enough if the waiter in the restaurant didnt suddenly stand in front of the table and ask quotwaterquot but said quothello nice to see you here what would you like to drinkquot pool deck there are far too many passengers for the number of pools during the holiday season the pools are probably not usable at all on our trip there were already a lot of children on board and so everything was full the infinity pools were also unusable because they were always reserved the aidastars were great though even if there were never any free seats unless you were already sitting in the theatrium an hour before the start the aida cosma is just too big for us and is more like mass processing its not worth the money given the stress factor and the feeling of not being welcome we might try the smaller ships but hope to be able to read honest opinions beforehand as the diehard aida fans are willing to let anything happen to them with the prices and have lost sight of the reality of value for money
its entertaining appropriate delicious cozy with great views thanks to the staff
at the end of october last year we wanted to make a dream come true and invested all our holiday money with aida in a cruise with aida cosma unfortunately we realised on the first day at sea that we had booked a horror holiday it seems that the aida ship was massively overbooked during this period or that the ship and its services are not designed for the number of passengers i would like to list the inconveniences we encountered below specialty restaurants for our dream trip we booked the comfort deluxe drinks package so that we could fully enjoy the drinks on offer in the specialty restaurants among other things we wanted to try out the italian restaurant on the first day at sea unfortunately we then found out that all of the specialty restaurants were already fully booked for the entire trip so like people in second class we had to wait until a reserved table was not used is this standard at aida no free tables during the breakfast buffet we were really looking forward to the breakfast buffet we were unable to have breakfast on the first day at sea as there were no free tables at around am all the breakfast restaurants from the top fuego to deck were full and we had to wait in the market hall an employee wouldnt let us in because it was too full at around am we gave up and were unable to have breakfast that day arguments and stress in the theatrium and tv studio at the events and shows in the rooms mentioned we experienced scenes that no vacationer would want to experience on their vacation because there were far too few seats arguments broke out every day we had to be there at least minutes before the start of each event to get a seat only rarely were we lucky enough that the drinks arrived while we were waiting waiting times for drinks are unreasonable we wanted to really treat ourselves with the drinks package we had booked unfortunately the service here was disappointing too with an average waiting time of minutes for two cocktails we lost the joy of the drinks package in one case we had to wait minutes for two milkshakes in the theatrium one afternoon no excursions bookable the far too high number of passengers was also noticeable in the excursions apart from a hour city tour in cagliari we were unable to book any further excursions through you on the first day nobody on the ship wanted to hear our criticism of course i wanted to discuss our criticism with you during the cruise to do this i called the on board on november st at around pm i was promised an appointment which i would receive via mailbox message however this appointment was then scheduled so last minute by mr hadersbeck that i was only able to read the invitation in the evening after the suggested date i immediately contacted reception again and was promised a new suggested date unfortunately i never received this suggested date we are not alone in our opinion but there are probably already several complaints about this trip for now we say quotaida never againquot four people we know booked a trip with aida this year after our experience all of them rebooked with tui i asked aida to comment personally before i published this comment but here too all service failed in the reply email they simply thanked me for my constructive criticism
top organization friendly service staff cleanliness excellent culinary offerings and entertainment with something for all ages
we were very disappointed with the catering options and the quality of the food it felt like you had to pay extra for everything and it was quite expensive spa water in the room with the nonalcoholic drinks package ice cream in the ice cream bar the selection for children was very limited the air conditioning in the outside cabin could not be turned off only tempered and hummed or blew nonstop
service staff not very friendly excursion bookings are changed in time too many children in the hot tubs you cant find a quiet area
what i didnt like lukewarmcold food watered down drinks too many ice cubes cleanliness of the cabin could have been better what i liked the captain was very informative with his announcements the staff was very friendly the route with aidaprima from hamburg to norway and back was very good
there werent enough hylites at mealtimes and there was a smell of diesel in the middle of the staircase something has to be done about it thats not acceptable
mass tourism you are just a number everything is overcrowded there are no seats in the restaurant on a day at sea the whole pool deck is full and much too small you have to pay extra for the wellness pool and sauna you have to queue for an hour at the bar and get watered down cocktails
very nice ship everything well organized but unfortunately too many people on board
the aidanova is a large ship and there is a lot going on especially if you are travelling during the whitsun holidays we had a balcony cabin on the th floor i wouldnt recommend that to anyone because unlike other balcony cabins this cabin didnt have a sliding door but a normal door that closed automatically very heavy leaving it open at night was only possible if you wedged the balcony table between them at the bars youre lucky if you order a cocktail that looks like this one a caipirinha was sometimes in a l glass and sometimes in a l glass for the same price
beautifull ship no diesel smell on the upper desk beautiful interior nice rooms great experience
we spent a great week on the aida cosma in the mediterranean my son years old has celiac disease the staff were very knowledgeable there was a light food bar in the bella donna restaurant with many glutenfree products from schr they were also able to fulfill food requests there pancakes for breakfast schnitzel and nuggets for lunchdinner the best burger at the sea restaurant had glutenfree burgers the mamma mia pizzeria had glutenfree pasta and pizza
aida cosma is a really beautiful ship unfortunately there are a lot of children and a lot of noise on a sea day after am there is almost no chance of getting a lounger everything is taken up with towels unfortunately nobody takes care of it i called reception twice but the employee didnt understand my german the quiet area for adults is nice if you can get a lounger in the evening some men unfortunately wear shorts in the restaurants but that is allowed aida can improve it was different years ago a restaurant for adults only would also be an asset to aida cosma however i would like to mention that the food was really good
we were on the aida cosma which was overcrowded with guests even the service manager said that a critical point is always reached at guests there were problems with overcrowded dining rooms long waiting times and often the staff couldnt keep up with refilling ice cream and pancakes were always sold out and there were always long lines even for a cheeseburger in the fuego restaurant you had to wait minutes from ordering a cocktail to actually getting it took minutes but the worst thing was organizing the excursions we had booked the tapsy tour for people in rome as our little one got sick the night before we also went to the doctor we wanted to cancel places the statement on deck excursion desk was that we couldnt cancel any more places at such short notice and that we could only try to get the money back through travel insurance so only two of us went to the excursion bus at the bus we were told that the bus was already full and we could no longer travel aida canceled our seats which they said was not possible and sold them to another family aida obviously wanted to sell this tour twice they told us that we couldnt cancel and then just sold it to someone else if we hadnt gone to the bus we wouldnt have noticed aidas motto seems to be if were going to charge them twice at least well smile at them so even aida was embarrassed and they canceled the tour and credited us for all people which we didnt want at all there was no real replacement tour and we had to take a tour that we didnt actually want in order to get to rome at all this tour was not a real replacement because it didnt have a tour guide and therefore no explanations or sightseeing the second tour in marseille was also terrible we had a tour guide who only spoke english there were also older people and small children on the bus who didnt understand anything so i at least translated for my children but after two hours of concentrating on listening and translating i had a headache the tour guide only had one topic the marseille football club he even showed us all the fan shops there was no other topic we could have done without that only the trip to barcelona was what you would expect a trip to be thanks to this tour guide i would definitely not go on another cruise with aida
beautiful ship great staff wonderful shows great food
great berths in oslo right next to the opera woke up in the morning with an amazing view very nice crew large selection of food and various restaurants always happy to come back smaller ship but very clean and well equipped
it was without question a wonderful trip the sunny weather also contributed a lot to that in the restaurants it was a bit turbulent because of the large number of people especially with children on the ship you get on the wrong side of the ship im not just talking about me you get on the wrong side of the older passengers they should think about the possibility of separate seating areas for older people without children well be back anyway see you on aida
the ship was not so overloaded on larger ships there were noticeably larger crowds of people
i was overwhelmed by the size of the ship and how clean everything was kept the food was good and plentiful and everything else was perfect we had a lovely holiday
very polite staff who care about the wellbeing of the guests perfect cleanliness in the cabins plentiful and good quality food our grandson thought the childcare was great
the good food
far too many people i can fry the meat better social media package disaster half an hour wait for a drink is not uncommon etc
it was our first cruise we were surprised that it was quite relaxed despite the ship we chose there was plenty on offer the food especially in the a la carte restaurants was great most of the staff were very friendly at times you had to wait a little longer for your drinks at some bars when it was busy but youre on holiday and you have time we didnt have any problems with that we didnt get bored on the day at sea either although we werent so keen on the evening shows which were certainly well done and elaborate we used those times to eat because of the whitsun holidays there were of course a lot of children on board overall apart from a few annoying children that wasnt a problem of course the slide and pool areas were full and loud but we didnt spend any time there overall we are convinced that we will go on another holiday with aida maybe not during the holidays then it will certainly be even more relaxed in our case we were also extremely lucky with the weather so many passengers were outside
eating in swimwear and dinner in very shorts
dear sir or madam here you will find our personal feedback on our experience traveling with aida cosma itinerary start in mallorca via cagliari sardinia rome marseille barcelona and back to mallorca travelers family of four with two children and years old overall impression this cruise with aida on the aida cosma was an absolute disaster and will definitely be our last restaurants constantly overcrowded hardly any free seats and endless waiting times made every meal a nightmare excursions the excursions offered by aida are pure ripoffs they neither matched the description nor were they worth their inflated price the organization was a total mess and using the app was a nuisance because you always ended up in the browser service the accessibility of the reception was a disaster at least calls were necessary to even reach someone prebooked services such as the family photo shoot were not correctly recorded in the system and it was an enormous struggle to get the costs refunded cabin our outside cabin with a large balcony was a joke constant smoke from the surrounding balconies made it impossible to enjoy the balcony a fresh sea breeze none kids club the strict age group separation in the kids club is ridiculous and prevented our children from spending time together a flexible solution was not even considered sun deck the loungers were reserved with towels as early as am this quotmallorca syndromequot is an absolute absurdity and is apparently tolerated by aida conclusion an day trip for just under and such a miserable service is a bottomless impertinence with over passengers on board you constantly felt harassed and cramped this cruise was our first and last with aida we hope that our harsh criticism will be heard and that the quality of services will be massively improved so that future passengers will not be as disappointed as we were note to aida drastically improve the quality of your services organization and communication otherwise you will continue to have angry and disappointed guests complaining about the miserable experiences best regards markus
a great trip a booked excursion was cancelled at short notice no alternative it wouldnt have worked the other way round that leaves a bad taste in your mouth no compromise or alternative offer what a shame
the entertainment and the choice of entertainment is great the opening times of the buffet restaurants could be improved
basically a nice short cruise with beautiful weather the entry and exit into and out of the ports was impressive since you are only in the ports for a few hours you cant see everything unfortunately there were hardly any free tables to be found in the buffet restaurant the food was ok but nothing special the crowds at the buffet were very annoying
friendly competent treatment of guestsbeha
this time the departure day was very poorly organized
great wellorganized trip on a modern lng ship service and food were very good would go again anytime
my wife and i had booked a super cabin for our golden wedding anniversary when we arrived on the ship however we were confronted with a reality that was not compatible with the confirmation of our cabin our complaint to the service staff ultimately lasted the entire first day at sea with the result that we had to move to inferior cabins not matching our travel price twice during our day trip during our entire trip we i am severely disabled with a disability level of and the g amp b mark along with my wife were not able to get a place on a lounger on the sun deck on a single day of the entire trip the reason for this was not our inflexibility but the overall organization of the free allocation of loungers on many days of the loungers were occupied by towels and where appropriate a personal item that had probably been marked by the person making the reservation one of the loungers was used as a footrest so that these resources could not be used without requests or arguments there was no service here who never made themselves available or helped on the sun deck even problems that were reported to a middlelevel housekeeping employee were dismissed when asked it was definitely not a relaxing trip we would have expected at least a refund of the price afterwards to even come close to being the face of aida
catastrophic bar and restaurant service except at the buffalo steakhouse
support and organization of the excursions competent staff great shows
i felt very comfortable on board the balcony cabin was perfect everything was there in a small space the food in the buffet restaurants was very good the staff was very friendly the excursions were very informative everything was excellent
too many unruly children on board constant noise and peeing in the pools
we are currently on the aidaluna so far so good however the temperature is unbearable the entire ship is freezing cold even the sauna area is far too cold most passengers are wearing thick sweaters and thick jackets in the public areas
bad priceperformance ratio poor quality for horrendous prices bad advice when booking warning do good research when choosing a cabin otherwise you will experience a fiasco we hardly got any sleep on deck cabins
absolutely excellently organized great service on board good food very well organized excursion
awesome boat it exceeded my expectations beautiful interior decorations everything completely new different and more original than other cruises great variety of restaurants and buffets included in the price super recommended
we didnt like that our request to change cabins due to noise pollution was not met
cleanliness friendliness additional costs for coffee drinks and permanent food
super clean staff friendly arrival and departure well organized buffet not good and not very varied events very loud few places to sit to play as a family eg cards tables are very low and small
very friendly crew and good organization clean ship
this was our nd aida trip im only giving it stars because the service people in the restaurants work their butts off are friendly for days and hours the quality and taste in the buffet restaurants has gone downhill and the food in particular was always a highlight on the ship once youve passed the first chafis everything repeats itself the names and sometimes the appearance of the dishes make a difference and in terms of taste attempts are made to create something culinary using dry spices the rest is dominated by casseroles and ragouts that are quick to cook and fill you up desserts seemed like instant mixes that were just sweet the one gentleman at the cheese buffet was completely overwhelmed cheese was only available after long queues and asking the restaurants were completely overcrowded in the east restaurant there were dishes that were also offered in the market restaurant on the same day the chicken drumsticks with a dry spice mix became tandoori chicken the flair of thaiasian cuisine did not come across from the second day onwards the first guests were bored and wandering around the ship looking for entertainment the twohour performance in the theatrium made up of bad dances bingo games etc doesnt appeal to everyone even on a day at sea it quickly becomes boring the guests are left alone too much and yes the service especially the friendliness at the information desk an absolute disaster in general many german crew members could learn a thing or two from the filipino crew im out of aida for now but ill try something different
bad loud small cabin which was not reserved and very poor to no information when excursions do not take place or are extremely delayed not again with aida sol
we had an unforgettable time with wonderful weather in norway on the aidanova everything was perfect cabin with balcony cleanliness quality and variety of food almost around the clock mostly very friendly staff negative points unfortunately very long checkin time with around hours waiting in an endless line and the sometimes inconsiderate guests in the buffet restaurants but aida cant do anything about that
as part of a holiday package we took a week cruise through the emirates on the aida cosma in march first of all i would like to say that otherwise we would never choose such a huge ship we were pleasantly surprised in many respects the quotcrowdsquot were distributed very well and in the restaurants in particular there was always a quieter spot the quality of the food was good there was always something to suit our taste we were satisfied the bars were sometimes chaotic the few staff were clearly overwhelmed and simply not enough the waiting times for a drink of up to minutes are unacceptable especially when you then get a nasty mixed drink very bad the entertainment program is aida something for everyone we thought the silent party was brilliant on the sea day the problem of reserving sun loungers is not new here either we are not one of them to find shade and peace we retreated to our veranda cabin unfortunately we didnt like the various pools and quotpuddlesquot either everything is very complex and divided into small sections and the paths on such a huge ship are of course very long checking in and out was surprisingly smooth we imagined it would be worse due to the crowds in short we were pleasantly surprised by the aida cosma nevertheless we would prefer the smaller aida ships in december we tried mein schiff for the first time we were completely disappointed here our high expectations were not met at all see review here why am i saying this if we choose a quotgermanquot ship we would choose aida again any time we clearly feel that we belong to the aida concept it starts with the departure music and ends with the entertainment program conclusion compared to ms we would always choose aida but a smaller ship both concepts have their strengths and weaknesses although for us ms only had weaknesses overall
very friendly and helpful staff on board food and service were excellent in my opinion the disadvantage was the location of our balcony cabin directly in the direction of travel behind the balcony cabins of two smoking couples this meant that despite sunny weather and mild temperatures we were unable to open the balcony door or sit on the balcony without passively smoking in this respect a clearer spatial separation between smokers and nonsmokers would have been desirable
perfect organization excellent food good selection of drinks but only with the additional booking of drinks packages for our taste too big a ship with too many passengers and too little peace and quiet
everything was okay on board from the cleanliness everywhere half board etc
everything was very well organized from the first to the last day friendly crew the buffet restaurant with the option of eating on deck gives a special holiday feeling
everything went well and the staff was very friendly and helpful the rooms were always clean and nicely decorated
the food was usually too cold and the internet often didnt work despite having a wifi connection you have to pay extra for the vending machine coffee even if you are intolerant to filter coffee the cabin and the beds were great
great crew great food
we are going on our first cruise as a family with the nova in june and have booked quotvarioquot we booked in march the balcony cabin now costs around less than when we booked basically thats the vario risk that you sometimes accept as a reward however we got a balcony cabin on deck below the lifeboats the childrens area is on deck we can now commute over decks every day with our children we are traveling in the low season and if we had booked a veranda cabin it would have only cost us more but since the balcony cabins only have glass balconies and thats nicer with small children we booked a balcony cabin before our cabin was visible on quotmyaidaquot we were offered an upgrade twice for at least extra for a veranda cabin which we did not do as we could have originally booked this cabin for more so the ship is not fully booked less than a week later our cabin was visible on quotmyaidaquot i then contacted aida and asked for another cabin aida was absolutely unaccommodating we could have another cabin for an additional charge of premium when i asked about the upgrade i was told that there was only a limited number of cabins i am well aware that this is the risk with vario we are already paying for this trip in the low season without extras and excursions a balcony cabin currently costs just under we have already traveled vario and premium without children but we have never been treated like this with a baby we were given a cabin on deck with another german shipping company pur tariff this is not familyfriendly and to make things even clearer in arhus there is an excursion to legoland in billund costs through aida adults child aged and over regular admission is for comparison panorama cruise to arhus costs per person i have read in various forums that families are often seated on deck but when it comes to paying they are welcome when we booked the msc was recommended to us as being very familyfriendly we will try it out on our next cruise our tip if possible book at short notice and as a family choose premium or another shipping company
cleanliness friendliness delicious food etc
i liked the way the theatrium was integrated into the bars however at times there are not enough bars open and not enough staff on duty so it takes ages to get a drink the food in the buffet restaurants is delicious but you cant get a seat if youre not there on time when they open
very eventful super delicious food nice acquaintance made
food service program childrens program great
the trip was characterized by many experiences impressions and wonderful moments we had a negative experience with the service at reception we were not helped with our problem and i had the impression that they did not want to help or support us furthermore the lady at the reception in the wellness area was not particularly nice we had the impression several times that she was annoyed by the guests the entire service staff was fantastic big compliments
the cabin was very well equipped the signposts should be better you dont know which direction something is in too much for a newbie
more transparency more fairness more information in advance when is an allinclusive package worthwhile where is the capacity of the restaurants already exhausted in advance more signposts on the ship take strict action against sun lounger occupiers how can it be that the sun loungers are already covered with towels at am and then no one is to be seen for hours why are the same candidates always chosen for the shows it is said that the buffet restaurants serve the same food everywhere but the reality is different
if youve never been on a trip like this its simply unbelievable i was really amazed all the staff are incredibly courteous even when fellow travelers are behaving badly
disloyal staff infernal noise in the adjacent cabins buffet restaurants have the charm of a factory canteen internet keeps crashing i spent hours at the registration desk because of this
party mile below the cabin it was almost like assault continuous noise until midnight peaking at decibels
our top rating is based on the following aspects the entire trip is perfectly organized from a logistical point of view all processes on board are customeroriented and userfriendly the staff especially the waiters in the aida bar and the bella donna restaurant are extremely friendly the ship is very clean and well maintained there are extremely interesting entertainment programs
the food could have been better and better organized simple but modern ship hardworking staff
it was fascinating what was on the ship
first day i want to go home the food is of poor quality only warmed up the wifi costs extra you get the feeling youre being ripped off this doesnt apply to the staff upgrading is only possible up to days before the start of the trip after that its not possible even though the hotline says theres still plenty of space we would have paid euros unfortunately theres nothing to do with luxury here maybe superficial
the stella is by far the best ship in the fleet we really appreciated having such great staff although the other crews werent bad either
once aida always aida not our first and not our last cruise with aida different countries different people great moments the only thing that is really annoying are these me people who reserve the pool loungers at am and then dont use them until after lunch
i really liked the boat the interior decoration the pools and jacuzzis the outdoor area the variety of restaurants included in the price everything was very new i recommend
on the way home the passengers were dropped off at the wrong terminal at rome airport
the trip itself was very nice but all the buffet restaurants were very full in the morning my partner and i walked through several restaurants almost every day to get two seats we also tried different meal times in the hope that the crowds would decrease and that we would be able to find a seat without any problems in addition a child in the ocean screamed for two hours straight which disturbed many guests who were sitting in the restaurant we would have liked one of the parents to leave the restaurant with the child while the child was having a fit we also had a very unpleasant experience where a woman in the wellness area almost puked in front of us i felt that more measures were needed here
too many children on board i really enjoyed norway again
the cabin staff were very nice and accommodating the spa area on the larger ships should be reconsidered as should the restaurants
i enjoyed the excursions the cities of gothenburg aarhus and copenhagen showed off their charm the aida mar is showing its age and needs a general makeover it is better to separate smokers from nonsmokers this should be asked when allocating the cabin otherwise the balcony cabin you booked is hardly usable because of the cigarette smoke unfortunately the chef was obviously not in the mood the meals have been better the table wine was not so watery and back then you could still enjoy your morning coffee it would have been a hit in a retirement home very very very thin starbucks couldnt make up for that either the priceperformance ratio is no longer right we waited a long time at the bars and even after ordering from the staff we had to wait a long time for our drinks im not a fan of bad reviews but we expected more from our previous trips and are very disappointed wake up before its too late
the food is not worth stars what a pity the priceperformance ratio is simply not right here the service also needs improvement especially at reception
nowadays it is just mass processing on the aida ships much too big the staff often seem annoyed there are a lot of children on board
top priceperformance ratio friendly service staff whether in the restaurant the bar or in the cabin
the quality and selection of the food was not good it would be better to spend a little more and book msc very good food and entertainment or tui mega good food and drinks quieter than msc
conclusion everything is hectic always jostling whether its the buffet drinks shore excursions sauna pool horrible then the endless scanning of the boarding pass when ordering drinks everything seems to take forever even though the most expensive drinks package was booked in advance for just under per day absolutely not recommended
the ship is completely overcrowded not enough sun loungers and places in restaurants shore excursions are really badly organized
the ship was too big people staff thats just not possible very impersonal atmosphere and there were too few staff for such a big ship we dont know whether aida really did itself a favor during the week rotation there were many bowling clubs and associations on board that just wanted to quotdrinkquot
they should pay more attention to the audience and reduce the number of children on the ship or simply advertise children and family trips then you know in advance what hell you are going into
great entertainment great restaurants and very friendly service staff
everything went very well from booking to departure super nice caring staff
unfortunately the priceperformance ratio continues to decline less quantity and more quality should be the focus entertainment has reached the lowest level you almost dont want to go there anymore shows were also miles away from good entertainment that used to be different the ports visited were well chosen the weather was also great staff as always friendly and helpful the aida cosma built in is still in good shape the dirty chairs in the restaurants need to be reupholstered or replaced there is food from years in them
you get the feeling that they have to want to fleece you to the limit of what is possible
sunbeds may no longer be occupied with towels for hours
too many people
there is nothing to complain about it was wonderful service cleanliness friendliness
unfortunately it was a disappointment for us we took the short trip kiel oslo copenhagen the cabins are not up to date very simple and in some places quite worn cleanliness is poor only superficially cleaned absolute mass event everything is overcrowded unpleasant and intrusive entertainment something is being sold almost constantly the restaurants are overcrowded and the quality of the food is only average even minutes before the restaurant opens you have to queue with at least other guests to get a table lots of community tables not our taste we prefer to be among ourselves in the speciality restaurants the food comes in a confusing order and staggered in time so that the first person has finished before the last person even gets their food glasses at the bars and in the restaurants are often dirty plates at the buffet as well the crowd on the ship is abysmal manners consideration or thinking unfortunately most of them are missing selfish behavior by many guests the main thing is that you are first at the buffet have the best table and are served first very unpleasant the service staff are mostly very dedicated but this depends very much on the tips i find this preferential treatment unfair if you tip enough in a restaurant you dont have to worry about getting a table the service will reserve it for you our normally high tip was apparently not enough for this special service you had to plan carefully when to eat so that you got a nice table and didnt have to queue for hours at the buffet or get crowded this was not a vacation for us the additional services we booked were inadequate the champagne we ordered was brought to our room warm and without glasses the greeting card we ordered was wrapped around the bottle with a rubber band the minute massage lasted minutes in one session and minutes in the other unfortunately for us this was not what we expected vacationers who are looking for commercial mass tourism and have no expectations of quality might have fun here
the holiday with aida perla was really nice the organizers think of things that i would not have thought of when planning to be honest i have never returned from a holiday so relaxed unfortunately the excursions are massively overpriced and i didnt book any i cant judge the entertainment because im not interested in that kind of thing the food in the buffets is ok but nothing special the food in the paid restaurants was really tasty the prices in the shops were ok sometimes even cheaper than in germany the baby pool was very dirty the play equipment in the teen lounge was broken the circuit boards were exposed i cant judge whether that was safe when i reported this to reception they said it would be taken care of the staff are mostly extremely friendly and accommodating especially towards small children the cleanliness in the rooms was not so good however this will be changed if you tell reception you will also receive a small apology what really annoyed me was the music that was played every time we set off i can never listen to the song sail away again normally i would have given stars for the great service and the great destinations but because i had really high expectations of aida because of its reputation im only giving it stars however i would book again with a small child at any time because there is really a lot on offer for the little ones and the baby corner is a big plus
very poor quality of the food raising the prices for the trip and reducing the quality at the same time is stupid we wont be traveling with aida again any time soon
extremely nice crew in the restaurants good social mix and lots of children ship very good
aidastella clean in good condition good entertainment program buffet food kind of boring but okay
i liked the boat restaurants and food i didnt like the weak shows and artists poor destinations useless sailing days ugly fat and badly dressed people everything in german with no english option from food to the daily program to the mail its ridiculous
great trip great staff and service cant be improved any more
the quality of the ships and the food is declining every year cuts are being made everywhere just to be able to offer a low price
the cosma from tenerife to barcelona was great the ship was almost fully booked but there were no long waiting times perfect service great food great entertainment we were very satisfied again see you on aida
positive aida trips are pleasantly uncomplicated on board negative the quality of the food has become worse compared to previous trips the many small and therefore unnecessary ways of eating are very negative two examples water bottles in the room are subject to a charge if the traveler has already booked a land tour but returns from the short trip with the shuttle bus the guest must pay the full cost of the shuttle again
no customer orientation no goodwill in the event of booking problems experienced unfriendly staff on several occasions long waiting times on board and during excursions not a convincing priceperformance ratio
everything was fine except for the neighbors who smoked heavily balcony cabin was therefore barely usable
day cruise on the aidamar through the baltic sea not a luxury cruise but center parcs on a boat security staff at checkin was very unfriendly cabin small but clean and well looked after by kevin days on land were quite short you had to be back on board by pm at the latest but the last shuttle bus left much earlier breakfast was good dinner in the buffet restaurants was ok some things were overcooked and crispy fries were not understood buffalo steakhouse was very good the burger bar was a disgrace dry meat coleslaw way too sweet and portions were minimal and you wait another half hour for that entertainment by the aidastars was very good the rest was nothing special sitting outside by the pool or on the decks above means inhaling cigarette smoke because people like to smoke a lot and everywhere german staff were often grumpy and had little patience with customers whose native language was not german asian staff were very friendly this was our first cruise to us it didnt feel luxurious but more like center parcs at sea maybe well go on another cruise but with a company where we can experience some luxury and feel like valued customers
although there were a lot of people on board the people were very nice and friendly to each other
very well organized company with good motivated employees who are always friendly and helpful excellent varied food in all restaurants a relaxing eventful vacation
good food mediocre service cleanliness of the ship average
the east restaurant is dedicated to mr yaminda and his team they are top people super friendly people i would have liked to give but unfortunately we didnt have a good experience in the market and bella donna from the colleagues everything else was great aida again and again
the trip was nice the captain was great but the hosts should be replaced by older staff who can also deal with the guests mostly over the comments were below the belt
nice people great ship with lots to offer friendly service very good food
we always felt we were in good hands and always had someone to contact if we had any questions checking in and out as well as going ashore worked perfectly the range of food and drinks on offer was excellent except for the red wine in the buffet restaurants
everything was very well organized very friendly staff everything was very clean the food was excellent unfortunately there are people everywhere who have bad manners but those were the guests and not the staff
my experience was mainly positive good atmosphere friendly helpful always cheerful staff great parties but i dont recommend the small ships for families sometimes the standard of the party guests wasnt very high on the big ships i found it more dignified the buffet restaurants were ok but nothing more there wasnt much variety very full in places on the last evening of the trip for example the wine ran out that cant really be true i thought the trip was a good review a good
the women and men of the crew wereamazingwe felt really comfortablethanks again for the wonderful week
good organization friendly staff in all departments lots of offers sports restaurants entertainment excursions wellness always information from the captain good food overall good value for money
there is complete satisfaction everything was perfect cleanliness friendliness the great selection of various activities in the evenings the restaurants were all of the highest quality
food bad internet bad mass tourism according to cheap is better culture
too many people on board
nice vacation but not everything that glitters is gold if you have celiac disease and need a glutenfree diet it would be nice if you could get one at the light food bar when you asked and not get the answer not today and nobody can tell you which drinks are glutenfree why not just mark it on the bar menu just like the vegan drinks photo flat rate booked as a new offer unfortunately only a lot of listless photographers a lot of the pictures taken are simply gone and why only search for pictures by reference photo why cant the cabin number be briefly stated for every photo shoot many pictures of strangers are found data protection image rights the aida cosma is a very nice ship most of the employees are very friendly and try hard but sometimes a little uncoordinated especially when the bars or restaurants get full you dont go on holiday because of the internet but in this day and age a social media flat rate should work and when even your own employees say that the aida app is a disaster then that says it all this was our th aida trip but it will be the last for now
poor quality in the buffet restaurants and far too noisy
just returned from a week cruise with the aidablu from to very bad experience that smoking is allowed in several places both in an area on the pool deck and at the bar of the pool deck smoking is also allowed at the bar at the back of the ship covering half the space there is no swimming pool on this ship but large hot tubs another big travesty is that the ship does not have a theater the performances simply take place in the atrium they call this the theatrium completely inadequate for a ship with passengers a stage has been built in the form of a socalled catwalk surrounding it on deck are rows of benches without railings there are rows of seats on deck but from rows and you can hardly see the stage on deck there are also rows of seats around this socalled stage and it is only with difficulty that the stage can be seen from row a complete mockery and far too few places this caused a lot of frustration and irritation among the guests you know that the main language is german but other nationalities are completely ignored no welcome or anything the casino is a joke compared to other shipping companies it doesnt make sense only a few machines only in euros and can only be used with your onboard card no loose euros to be entered thats taped off the food although aimed at germans is good hot and sufficient the operation is correct the drink selection is sufficient the cleaning is ok nevertheless we will not use or recommend aida again of the other companies we have sailed with hal ncl princess cruises celebrity this is by far the least expensive shipping company
nice and good service german tour guides on shore excursions onboard language german affordable youth price up to years large and good culinary offer great entertainment on board
service was sometimes poor when dealing with small children you had to get your own child seats and were sent from one waiter to the next when our daughter dropped rice during dinner one waiter reacted aggressively a bartender refused to make our daughter a milkshake without crushed ice although others managed to do it there was never a clear statement about when a spa day for families would take place for the second time around ten parents were informed in the childcare center that there was no childcare due to a lack of children the water in the suite took four minutes to heat up instead of solving the problem we were given an introduction to how to turn a faucet
it was very good as always one thing to note the prices for drinks and in the onboard shop should not be overpriced
my first cruise i was very impressed by everything the size of the ship very good service very good food selection completely comfortable
the ship is very big but you dont really feel the crowds it is a beautiful ship with very good facilities comfortable and clean the food was fantastic
it wasnt the great holiday that everyone always talks about the food cleanliness service and friendliness left a lot to be desired
committed staff good entertainment for adults very clean cold indoor swimming area end of april friendly and funny waiters of the passengers over and not so childfriendly
i felt like i was on vacation everyone was very warm and friendly the staff was very well trained and always friendly
the entire team provided a balanced and very pleasant atmosphere with each other and with the guests on board everyone was approachable a great team
great cruise quotmoin cruisequot very good varied program but impossible passengers from pm onwards seats in the theatrium were taken up by towels grandmas crutches and plump people sitting with their legs apart egoism at its finest that was for the otto event which started at pm it wasnt quite as bad for the nathan evans concert
politeness service and the feeling of being well looked after and cared for the human closeness between crew and passengers is exemplary
it was a lot of fun the crew was always helpful and friendly the cabin balcony was great and always clean the a la carte restaurants are particularly worth mentioning the food here is highly recommended and it is quieter than in the buffet restaurants next time however we will focus more on a ship with fewer children aida is ideal for families with children
the implementation of the moin events we did not reserve any seats hours before the start and therefore did not visit the theatrium or the beach bar during events although we were checked in on deck it was not possible to get hold of the advertised fish sandwiches for example
the friendliness of the staff except in the kids club and the high quality of the food and drinks was outstanding the whole ship was also very clean we will be back
interesting route nicefriendly staff annoying drink package selectionuse
very well organized and beautiful ship also plenty to do for children to be repeated
super organized great food very friendly staff
large ships have to manage masses of passengers better i felt the mass of people like in the winter sales in department stores
we were completely satisfied everything was very clean the selection of food was very good the food itself tasted great the staff were incredibly friendly and always in a good mood all in all highly recommended
overall very good lots of options for families with children but also a lot of people eating
my first vacation and first cruise it couldnt have been better ship clean staff friendly and helpful and the food great
the company impresses with its team spirit friendliness cleanliness punctuality and the way the crew especially the captain treats his guests sometimes we would have liked a little more peace and quiet but with children this is not out of the question
the service the food the entertainment the excursions from aida
there is no more sea than this so many destinations in one week with excellent cuisine and friendly people is only possible on the aida
ive just had a great second cruise once again everything was perfectly organized from start to finish very friendly and courteous staff on board unfortunately reports about the living and working conditions of the employees tarnish the image of the perfect aida family this gives the whole thing a bad aftertaste and makes one thing or another seem like a mere facade i would like to see these allegations dealt with more openly and the friendly and hardworking people in the background who are there for the guests every day employed under fair working conditions and paid appropriately
arrivaldeparture and excursions perfectly organized crew friendly helpful and extremely nice food and beds perfect
we felt in good hands from the start nice cabin great service staff and met lots of new people
great ship everything very clean nice friendly staff the food was simply amazing
if you enjoy crowds standing in line and hordes of small children this ship is perfect for you but if you are looking for relaxation you should choose a different ship
in general the holidaymakers were obviously satisfied
why was an idiot introduced into the shows an idiot with a stuffed dog nobody wants to see him three trips the same show three times three trips to nova the same music played three times in the beach club by the live bands its getting boring
always an open ear for complaints friendly staff good food
aida perla is a very beautiful ship balcony cabins are nice staff are almost always very friendly food is good to very good excursions are worthwhile unfortunately the entertainment program was inadequate due to the many days at sea it could be so nice aida wants to attract young people ok nothing wrong with that in the first week i thought the children were really great they were so independent and you could talk to them awesome and still so young only then did the parents come with their very small children and babies they showed no consideration for the other passengers thats where the fun stops for me children screaming and screeching until late in the evening in the restaurant theater balcony beach club etc this is my th trip with aida and i have always been very satisfied but that is now unfortunately history i had to spend a lot of money on this trip and to put it bluntly i dont want to be in kindergarten
the trip was very nice nobody can do anything about the weather the mood on board was good the only thing that could be criticized was the lack of hygiene among the travelers hands were not disinfected etc
beautiful cabins huge selection of food in the different restaurants beautiful spa and wellness area everything is top notch
too crowded not suitable for small children waiting times too long everywhere
the food is becoming more and more uniform and no longer distinguishes itself from one another the desserts are mostly just chemical mush and have nothing to do with enjoyment unfortunately there are only bigger more profitable and cheaper foods the drinks in the bars are getting smaller and smaller the ice cubes are getting bigger as is the price of them alcohol is only used in homeopathic doses excursions are no longer affordable for normal people and renting bikes is a financial disaster but it doesnt matter as long as the return is right everything is fine
individual choices on board and on land for meals and activities good selection of port locations to stay on site or take an excursion
the ship is beautiful but too many people
worst service on the worlds oceans ive been standing in line on the aidacosma for minutes for a cup of coffee
everything was good the food was great the organization was really great all needs and wishes were fulfilled all the restaurant and cleaning staff greeted us with a smile every day nothing was impossible thank you
good service clean expensive shore excursions annoying booking of drinks
apart from the billing which was only sorted out at home everything was fine but we had not used any aida excursions embarkation and boarding should be improved on large ships food on the aida niva was consistently above average
perfect organization perfect food and drinks
food is getting worse and the excursions with aida are simply not worth your money
the food is very good large selection of dishes and restaurants service for drinks is a disgrace minutes was our speed record for a drink during the performances ordering two drinks per person at once is not allowed here one can assume that the waiters are instructed to work slowly so that as much of the drinks packages as possible is left for aida this is confirmed by the fact that the waiters stand around a lot and move provocatively slowly the shows are a total disaster very improvised and in some cases really of the lowest standard the quotcomedyquot area in particular is more than bad people in bathrobes in the catering and buffet areas are very unpleasant nothing is done about it in conclusion the food and cabin are very good the rest is nothing great a shame
people with small children and very young children need to be made aware that everyone on the ship is looking for peace and quiet and that consideration should be shown to older mobilityimpaired and disabled citizens out of politeness
i can only say good things about aida they make a lot of effort to make sure you feel good very good catering fooddrinks service ambience
in my experience the employees were always in a good mood friendly and happy despite a lot of work and not enough staff even though there was a noticeable shortage of staff we can take a great example from them
the waiters were very nice rifal marvin maricel and melody
the priceperformance ratio has now decreased the drinks packages are overpriced its worth doing the math the excursions are generally too expensive you can get by just fine with english breakfast times are often very short in general it can be seen that the trips are becoming more expensive but the service is decreasing eg variety in the food freshness of the fruit free childcare it can also be worthwhile to take a look at what other shipping companies have to offer
the ship the activities the food in the restaurant were delicious
this was my second cruise with aida i do these trips for my grandparents the ships are very beautiful and clean the cabins have everything you need its wonderful to sit on deck on nice days during the holidays its almost impossible to relax on deck so i recommend a balcony the staff are friendly food well yeah for people like me who always cook from scratch the food is better than canteen food theres not much choice for vegetarians and vegans dont get me wrong you can always find something tasty but as i said well yeah you wait a long time for your drinks in any of the bars our highlight was almost half an hour considering that the drinks are massively overpriced its not much fun we were very happy with the cabins inside cabins and those with windows
the staff on board were exceptionally friendly and always helpful the ship is always clean and tidy a lot of effort is put into the supporting programs the food on board is also varied and there is something for everyone the fitness area is good although more options such as tv on cardio machines would be desirable the wellness area met our expectations exactly
canary islands cruise with madeira arrival the flight is delayed by a good minutes but with a tailwind we reach tenerife south airport after about hours the luggage is there in no time and we continue to the aida bus which takes us to puerto de la cruz to the pier of the aidacosma in about minutes checkin is also quite quick here aida is pretty well organized reception when we asked at reception and at a bar on deck we were told that with the premium all inclusive drinks package we have to pay for the water in the cabin ourselves fortunately this information turns out to be wrong planetarium unfortunately the evening event in the planetarium is rather scary one or two more drinks at the bar where there are alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks until you drop east restaurant in the evening we go to the east restaurant for asian food everything is very tasty unfortunately the buffet is not built to handle the rush of the masses there is jostling like at a butchers botanical garden monte and market hall the trip is very well organized the market hall is rather disappointing and the whole trip is botanically overloaded the muchdescribed sleigh rides on the monte cost compared to which a ride on the carousel at the dippemess fun fair and sales market in frankfurt is a real bargain at the end of the event the event ends in a sales room for wine and souvenirs from madeira i cut the trip short here and walked back to the aida a disappointing trip for my expectations in the period from am to pm you can show more of funchal than describing every single plant in the botanical garden luckily this was the only trip we booked through aida aidacosma heres another tip dont believe the sayings that so many people quotget lostquot on such a big ship this is definitely not the case especially at meals and in the bars internet and while were on the subject of negative reviews you can forget about the onboard internet if its already included in the package thats fine otherwise please dont book the corresponding offers you might as well throw the money into the sea departure unfortunately this was followed by a very special experience a member of staff at the gate asked us very loudly and very rudely to form a queue even my suggestion to this lady that she should change her way of expressing herself a little didnt change anything other guests were then loudly insulted using words that i dont want to repeat here unfortunately this was an unprofessional approach by this member of staff which was not taken back by colleagues standing nearby conclusion overall a successful cruise with the aidacosma i wont be going back on the ship though these crowds are just too much for me the service on board the friendliness of the staff as well as the food and the cleanliness are exemplary you shouldnt expect gourmet food though i see room for improvement with the bar staff ordering here simply takes too long one of the reasons for this is that the employees in the round bars have to walk far too long distances
great ship great crew great food great shows everything was just wonderful
crowded and loud drinks more water than anything else pool area completely overcrowded food good staff very friendly nice cabin balcony cabin if you want to party this is the place for you sleeping in afterwards is not possible because of the noise everywhere
aida sol the worst service i have ever experienced during my vacation i was treated unfriendly and condescendingly at reception my concerns were only noted on the third attempt i was accused of making a demand accommodation where i can relax and not be sleepless because of the high noise level from the air conditioning and the supply shaft next door seems appropriate to me for the price of the trip i could have changed my cabin for a fee of euros i booked my balcony cabin in the vario tariff because i dont mind the location however that doesnt mean that i have to put up with an unacceptable cabin when there are other balcony cabins that werent occupied this trip was not relaxing
aida nova is a ship for families there is something to discover everywhere good restaurants great offers not always free its a shame unfortunately for those with gluten sensitivity the only food available is in bella donna and then you always have to ask one of the staff to give you something which is pretty stupid in a buffet restaurant the bread is also dry although it is good quality from the floor rebells the bread that is baked properly tastes wonderful unfortunately aida doesnt know how to do it well although i have complained about it several times on various trips its a shame some cuts have also been made in the last three years the food is no longer as varied as in previous years and unfortunately the leftovers from the almost empty containers are poured into the new containers thats not tasty
the tendering needs to be improved we stood in the stairwell for an hour before we got into the tender boat when it gets crowded you have to call for decks or separate the passengers on excursions from those going ashore individually
cleanliness very satisfactory food bad price way too high
well organized and conducted excursions very good service staff good restaurants with a wide selection good evening program
unfortunately we were disappointed with the ship as everything smelled very old and the paintings were poor quality
aida diva restaurants totally overcrowded every day no matter what meal we were having we had to spend ages looking for a free table always total chaos at the buffets in the afternoon only the almhtte and the quotbest pizzaquot were open with guests on board no chance of getting a seat we left hungry sauna infusions were sometimes ridiculous a small pot of water was carelessly poured onto the stove within minutes and that was it thanks but never again aida
not a good choice for allergy sufferers and people who have to eat glutenlactose free inexperienced staff no one to talk to poor preparation of the goods despite instructions you feel like a beggar at the only station that offers food the nova was otherwise perfect in terms of service and the atmosphere overall
everything was fine nobody could do anything about the stormy days
great trip great ports very friendly service staff in the restaurants battle for the sunbeds
trip to bari actually very nice but you can skip the restaurant very stressful and you have to be done in minutes i felt like i was being made a fool of i wouldnt want to go through that again what a pity despite the rain i really enjoyed the trip otherwise
we started our aida cruise on the stella with great expectations but the excitement quickly faded shameless ripoffs lousy food and unfriendly staff turned our vacation into a disaster ripoff on the flight aida booked an extremely early flight for the return flight am departure from the arrival port unreasonable for the guests and a day of vacation was stolen because we had to get up in the middle of the night despite numerous requests no free rebooking was possible only a preferred flight was offered for a massive surcharge aida was only interested in its own profit not the comfort of the guests aida charges for a seat reservation and pays the airline a threefold surcharge outrageous impudence having to take your luggage off the ship yourself because there was no luggage service available at am when you had to disembark for the aida flight thats just not acceptable why does aida book something like that for its guests poor food in the inclusive restaurants bland loveless mass processing with convenience products instead of fresh food meat quality is abysmal selection is mediocre with the exception of costa ive had much better food in the restaurants that were included in the price of the trip on all other shipping companies ive been on over cruises unfriendly and discriminatory staff at the bars most of the staff at the bars were rude and disinterested with a few exceptions the service was mostly stressed and annoyed a bar employee reacted cheekily to an order for a caf latte and ran away when he was asked about his unfriendliness original quote quoti would like a caf lattequot waiter quotagainquot it was the first one for me that day in the bar guests were also turned away even though others were still being served hence possible discrimination as this happened to my darkskinned husband this was discussed with the hotel manager and fampb director but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth but at least this complaint was taken seriously and the staff at reception were always friendly and helpful including with regard to this complaint the service in the la carte restaurants was good and attentive the service at the buffet was ok but since it was a buffet it was just about clearing away the service in the burger restaurant was very unfriendly the service from the housekeeping was really great however proletarian clientele many guests were already very drunk at lunchtime and displayed disruptive behavior but the staff did not ban these guests from drinking alcohol homophobic comments from other passengers we were a group from the lgbtiq community but aida cant do anything about it conclusion the aida stella offered a disappointing cruise experience ripoffs poor food mostly unfriendly staff at the bars and a proletarian crowd massively spoiled our vacation aida has lost all trust and we will certainly never book with them again stay away from aida suggestions for improvement for aida respectful treatment of all guests this applies especially to the bar staff significant improvement in the quality of the food in the restaurants included in the travel price and a price adjustment in the la carte restaurants shrimps on a salad for extra is too expensive customeroriented solutions instead of ripoffs mainly applies to the aida flights training of the bar staff in terms of friendliness and competence note this review refers to the aida stella in april experiences on other aida ships may differ
what is advertised is also kept cleanliness very good food a wide range of food and drinks comfortable cabins very friendly staff incomparable experiences they dont promise too much
the allround service and the culinary variety on board the captain brought us safely through the rough sea
the ship aida cosma is modern clean and safe the food is plentiful always available and of good quality the docking times are nice and long the waiters are grumpy and overworked orders are taken hesitantly and are carried out very late in the french kiss we had to get our own drinks from the buffet restaurants next door the internet was notable for its constant network problems simply annoying despite having an internet package the airline marabou offers wornout seats and only a paid drinks service at the start of the trip for the remaining four hours you can get water from the toilet
aida bella old rusty ship food a little better than in the canteen some of the fruit bad pool water heavily chlorinated and a light film of grease on the water just disgusting drinks are expensive with less alcohol than intended shore excursions are catastrophic large drinks no coordination even in the dining facilities there is a long wait in front of them and then a crowd not a holiday feeling i cant imagine what its like on a large aida ship
we were very satisfied with the crew and the entire staff
outdated ship unfortunately very smelly bathroom very loud not very varied catering offer
its great to be pampered like that unfortunately on the day we were on board the wellness area was overcrowded and the pool was too small
the friendliness and helpfulness of the entire crew
family atmosphere every single employee is attentive to the guest
super organized from start to finish everything very clean and tidy delicious food and very friendly and courteous staff
ok for families but unfortunately very high additional costs for drinks food in the buffet restaurants could be better
arrival the flight is a good minutes late but with a tailwind we reach tenerife south airport after around hours our luggage is there in no time and we head on to the aida bus which takes us to puerto de la cruz to the aidacosma pier in around minutes checkin is pretty quick here too aida is pretty well organized in this regard reception when we asked at reception and at a bar on deck we found out that with the premium all inclusive drinks package we have to pay for the water in our cabin ourselves thankfully this information turns out to be wrong planetarium unfortunately the evening event in the planetarium is rather scary one or two more drinks at the bar there are alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks galore east restaurant in the evening we go to the east restaurant for asian food everything is delicious but unfortunately the buffet is not built to handle the onslaught of crowds there is jostling like at a butchers botanical garden monte and market hall the excursion is very well organized the market hall is rather disappointing and the entire excursion is botanically overloaded the muchdescribed sleigh rides on the monte cost compared to which a ride on the carousel at the dippemess fun fair and sales market in frankfurt is a real bargain at the end of the event the event ends in a sales room for wine and souvenirs from madeira i cut the excursion short here and walked back to the aida for my taste it was a disappointing excursion in the period from am to pm you can show more of funchal than describing every single plant in the botanical garden luckily this was the only excursion we booked through aida aidacosma heres another tip dont believe the sayings that so many people quotget lostquot on such a big ship this is definitely not the case especially at meals and in the bars internet and while were on the subject of negative reviews you can forget about the onboard internet if its already included in the package thats fine otherwise please dont book the corresponding offers you might as well throw the money into the sea departure unfortunately this was followed by a very special experience a member of staff at the gate asked us very loudly and very rudely to form a queue even my suggestion to this lady that she should change her way of expressing herself a little made no difference other guests were then loudly insulted using words that i dont want to repeat here unfortunately this was an unprofessional approach by this member of staff which was not taken back by colleagues standing nearby
crew officers naval and ceo entertainment very experienced captain very experienced crew service bars and restaurants very very good reception very good the ship is great i have a few comments about observations possible dangerous situations can arise
it was very nice and as usual everything was clean and the entire staff was very friendly
we had a wonderful holiday maybe some more staff in the restaurants thanks for the maintenance staff everything was clean and tidy
the onboard staff whether restaurant bar room service etc were very courteous friendly and helpful please keep it up dallmann
we were very well looked after and served well all the waiters were very friendly the lanai bar in particular was always our favorite area it was the best there
very well organized course of the entire cruise large selection of wellprepared food friendly staff cleanliness on the entire ship immediate response to complaints
based on our experience we cannot recommend the aida cosma the buffet restaurant was chaotic and we felt pressured to visit the more expensive la carte restaurants this resulted in additional costs the excursions were overpriced and the staff not particularly friendly the balcony cabin offered little privacy as the neighbor could easily see our balcony which bothered us a lot there were too many children and the adult area was too small even the infinity pool was inaccessible to us as a loud childrens party was taking place there although the concept was intended for everyone we unfortunately felt out of place
good organization friendly staff delicious food many offers on board
from booking to arrival on board and shore excursion to culinary delights and return journey everything was excellent
we were dissatisfied with the temperatures and the noise level in the wellness oasis we were also dissatisfied with the breakfast offerings at the buffalo steakhouse
i have been on cruises so far the latest one with the aidabella from dubai to bangkok this was so bad that it has put me off cruises for quite a while the schip did not have a normal cruise ship size swimming pool of communication was only in german except the written information that was in german only normally the night before a booked excursion an envelope would be put on your cabin door post box with your booking details for the following day not on this cruise you had to use google translate and look it up on the tv or wait your turn at information to have it confirmed unlike the germans my wife and i had to apply and pay a each for visas for vietnam and as it turned out the schip did not go to vietnam for some reason smoking was allowed on board at a lot of places on the schip and as none smokers we were often unavoidable exposed to it and forced to inhale second hand smoke the food was okay but unfortunately it took a few days for the staff to realise that the plates needed pre warming as by the time you had found a table it would be lukewarm at best generally the none german staff with a few exceptions spoke english and deserve to get a mention for their correctness and patience with the mostly demanding guests next time i will check trustpilot first
three days from kiel to aarhus and copenhagen everything was great restaurants could have stayed open longer and had more to offer overall though a very pleasant trip the entertainment program in the theatrium was particularly great
very nice route eastern mediterranean great cabin very clean friendly and helpful staff unfortunately the food was bad very bad very mediocre quality much too salty pasta and potatoes always overcooked rice too hard not much variety i upset my stomach at the salad buffet i had diarrhea and vomiting one day a shame i had expected much more
it was a great cruise staff were always friendly and helpful
accessibility was not provided upon request but guests who did not need it were given it the food was very good in the nudist area you are not safe from other people taking videos with their smartphones complained twice about the water in the shower not draining but it was not repaired
i was very impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the cooking demonstration was particularly great there could be a small improvement in the area of the lifts so that they dont stop on every floor when theyre already full
some staff are unable to carry out everyday tasks or are not informed about their area of responsibility we had booked a photo flat because the description promised spontaneous photos in bars and restaurants unfortunately there were only staged photos at photo shoots when we asked the responsible staff gave rude answers and a day later the flat was cancelled and refunded mind you this cancellation was made unilaterally by aida suite guests have a checkout time of am when we returned from breakfast at am our suite was no longer accessible even though all of our personal travel items were still in the cabin nice is different
in some parts the stay on board was great in others not
showtime machine restaurant
we had a very loud cabin and had to move twice at least there was the option to change cabins it was a shame that we booked a day stay on the day of departure and then couldnt use it because no one wanted to let us on board with our luggage so we had unnecessary extra costs and didnt even have breakfast and that with a yearold in tow for us it was the first and last time with aida
it was my second time travelling with aida and my first time travelling with a baby aida offers great service good food and a lot of entertainment but unfortunately the quotlittlequot things are missing the restaurants were unfortunately completely overcrowded so that sometimes you had to leave without a seat the advertised baby pools were complete rubbish there was a quotpoolquot that was just a wet cold floor water came out of a few jets and dripped from above what baby likes that it was cold and the wind blew through it was awful the mini club was inviting to play however it was much too small and so overcrowded that only one adult with a child was allowed in i dont go on holiday to constantly be separated from my husband baby chairs in the restaurants were often in short supply the quotbaby cornerquot was good and i think what was on offer was great however my baby who is months old doesnt eat quothippquot and eats from the table however you had to be careful in the advertised childrens restaurants as there was meat in red wine sauce and only very salty dishes unfortunately there was very little choice for my baby so im glad to be back home so she can eat properly so all in all aida is perhaps good apart from the prices the poor spa facilities and the overcrowded ship i would never go on the nova with a baby again
the taste of the food at aida has deteriorated dramatically i was very disappointed
overcrowded frugal with food quality vegan only in a separate area
never again impossible people no free seats at dinner just terrible we were glad when the trip was finally over
i dont care about nova and cosma mass processing but the smaller ships feel more like a holiday i see a lot of room for improvement in the food it used to be better but you cant ask for too much because you have to pay more for good service mein schiff for example
i liked the extremely friendly onboard staff great i was annoyed by the ship aidadiva which is in need of renovation there were always bad smells feces on board in some cases the prices for drinks were excessive and the internet use was extremely problematic at an excessive price unbelievable
super nice experience well organized great food and experiences on board
all in all a great holiday nice ship for small children but for yearolds there are better ships in the fleet with more action
the large number of persistently uncooperative parents of small children is almost unbearable and prevents any feeling of wellbeing noise no places to retreat on board everything open some arrogant staff at the bars in particular the quotsuperiorsquot from the ranks of the asian crew members were extremely negative
everything was well organized on our aidakaren trip everything was clean staff very nice and helpful food was delicious
the restaurant in particular was more than disappointing no atmosphere always unpleasantly loud always queuing always standing in front of empty plates always cold food we longed to go back to the atlantic restaurant on mein schiff the drinks packages were a ripoff despite the deluxe comfort package we had to pay extra for a number of normal drinks an absolute nogo instead of motivating us the lovely hosts made sure that we had no desire to do anything with them a highlight was the service team in the burger restaurant always nice and friendly thanks guys the service team in the east restaurant also deserves special praise we often visited the brewery but currywurst with plastic filling and crispy duck with flight hours spoiled the fun for us
loud crowded very crowded some guests in the spa area were drunk and had drinks in the sauna
great ship but some of the waiters were bad we still havent received any of the paid dinners
the excursions the service the onboard restaurants were very good all the staff were very friendly
good entertainment on board food in the normal restaurants was good on longer trips some of the dishes were repeated in my opinion there was a lack of early information from the ship about situations that were not planned eg that a port could not be reached
i only experienced friendly crew members
great ship facilities staff food and offers
definitely dont go on holiday with babies few or even none quiet areas not enough choice of baby food no bathing allowed with swim diapers baby pool is cold
great ship great facilities delicious food and very good entertainment bernadette particularly stood out among the dancers
in contrast to other aida trips before this short trip with the aida luna to gothenburg amp copenhagen was a big disappointment and did not meet the usual standard the staff in the restaurant areas were very unfriendly we had to actually speak to them and ask them for the service we wanted place an order or clear the table this was particularly noticeable in the alpine hut where there is a waiter service the staff it seemed were reluctant to carry out their tasks it was similar in other areas too in all buffet restaurants the staff unusually showed great indifference towards the guests the same experience at the excursion counter on deck one of the employees working there when we asked her for information on different days was downright rude acting annoyed and bored towards us the quality of the catering has also deteriorated considerably some of the dishes served were not cooked properly and the vegetables were often still hard in addition there were chaotic conditions in the buffet restaurants with some serving food in passageways people were constantly told that they had to hurry because they were about to close again for another minutes the staff also couldnt keep up with refilling the buffet displays sometimes there was a quotyawning emptinessquot for a long period of time so that you had to make your rounds several times together with a mass of people who shared this problem the big drawback of this trip was the swapped excursion destinations for example on day originally planned for gothenburg the ship unexpectedly got into a naval maneuver in copenhagen so that docking and going ashore were delayed by almost hours the even bigger annoyance however was that the swap meant that the time remaining in gothenburg on day was very short as the ship had to set sail very early in order to make it to kiel by am the following day and you had to head back to the transfer bus by pm at the latest in addition there were berths far away with very long sometimes complicated transfers considering the already very short trip duration only full days this was an absolute nogo so the costbenefittime expenditure was not really worthwhile for us the stay in gothenburg which we had prioritized and longed for resembled a rush to get the last transfer bus back to the ship in time so with a stay in this large metropolis that ultimately lasted less than hours it was impossible to reach all of the planned excursion destinations on our penultimate aida trip on june with the aida perla to norway of the most significant and for us most important main destinations bergen stavanger with which the trip was also advertised were even replaced at short notice by other inferior destinations an even bigger nogo the individual excursions which were once lovingly designed are no longer taking place to the usual extent and have been significantly scaled down but the prices have increased massively everything is now purely commercial and geared towards the masses we are now so disappointed by all the negligence on the part of aida that we are seriously considering switching to other lines in the future our otherwise constant enthusiasm for the atmosphere and service on board has now come to an abrupt end the priceperformance ratio has become skewed and is unfortunately no longer acceptable for the customer unfortunately it is no longer possible to recommend aida
very good food but unfortunately there were a few situations on the trip where you had to queue and wait that was sometimes a bit tiring as a guest
the ship is impressive and great everything is beautifully done everything is very clean and of good quality fooddrinks what we didnt like was the mass processing in the restaurants we sometimes had to go to three restaurants to get a table it was also very difficult to get a lounger on sea days some people use the loungers more than once so they can change places at will and at any time the staff arent particularly friendly but there were one or two exceptions a lot of things cost extra and we werent given any instructions on where to find things we had to ask for everything or read about it in the onboard app for us it was the first and probably last cruise unfortunately we had a very noisy room so sleeping in wasnt an option you could only really enjoy the ship on business days if you stayed on board not really the point of a cruise
great new ship drinks and food good
unforgettable vacation my family father me and our yearold son really enjoyed the whole vacation of course we gained weight thanks to the great food on board the only thing that was a bit challenging was the number of people at the buffet but at a later time that was fine again super clean all around very tasty food great atmosphere in every single restaurant great service and lovely staff all in all a unique experience
i boarded the ship nervously and came down deeply relaxed
the quality has dropped significantly chaotic conditions and mass processing in the restaurants simply not nice anymore the staff are very unfriendly tables are not cleared the staff cant keep up with replenishing the buffet ripoff at a high level vacation is something else
food and entertainment were great finding a place to sit for meals with people was demotivating and reception was helpless in this regard
as an experienced cruiser family children and we never felt comfortable on the aida nova the ship offers a lot but is very poorly designed and extremely overcrowded the staff were mostly unmotivated and unfriendly the kids club for children is a joke compared to meinschiff here they dont stick to the advertised program you get the impression that the staff are annoyed by the children and their needs are a nuisance eating in the buffet restaurants is like a bad canteen the specialty restaurants are designed in such a way that there is constant traffic and you never have any peace and quiet and everyone is looking at your plate i realize that it is mass tourism but when you have a ship with people the conditions rooms and processes have to work which is not the case at all on aida nova royal caribbean manages this very well if you want to go on a cruise with small children you should pay a little more for mein schiff then you can have a relaxing holiday and are not as stressed as on the huge aida ships
everything was great there were a lot of people on the ship but we knew that beforehand there was nothing to complain about
the atmosphere on the ship was very welcoming the staff catered to every request the bar staff and waiters at the aida bar on the aida cosma deserve special praise they were all super friendly and you immediately felt like you had arrived
overall it was ok but there were far too many people and the queues in the restaurants and elevators were too long we booked a cruise on cosma canary islands and madeira route in the week after easter it was full everywhere and far too loud the stress level among the staff was correspondingly high and the guests were often very unfriendly and annoyed it is incomprehensible that there were always very long queues in front of the coffee machines for paid cappuccinos we cannot recommend the fuego restaurant which was also completely overcrowded with overwhelmed staff the risk of infection with so many people should unfortunately not be underestimated and our daughter caught a virus the service staff tried very hard but were simply overwhelmed by the crowds conclusion we would happily book with aida again but not on cosma on such a popular route during the holiday season
the ship aidanova is far too overloaded the food is very monotonous and of poor quality we even got severe gastrointestinal problems from it the excursions are too expensive people for a minute bus ride and some of the staff are very arrogant and unfriendly not the asian staff
just perfect all around if there was anything negative it was mostly caused by other guests
selection that was once upon a time on the aidabella the crew was so uncreative and the ship was in a bad condition regular customers are not the focus
chaotic conditions in the market restaurants especially at certain destinations japan etc only one restaurant was open at am all passengers had to quotline upquot for immigration shore excursions began at am so only one restaurant was open from am it was unbelievable what happened there almost all passengers stormed this market restaurant no way through the aisles empty trays tables not cleared dishes on the floor it was just degrading the cost savings lead to a lot of negative feedback from passengers on board
bad service on board too few and disinterested staff poor food selection and quality dirty cabin bad priceperformance ratio
positive cleanliness and friendliness of the staff nice excursions negative overall compared to the past and to smaller ships it has unfortunately developed negatively it is simply too big and confusing if you get sick relatives are not allowed to take anything from the dining room and nothing is delivered to your room either the ships doctor was only available from pm vouchers that you buy in advance and have to redeem beforehand but this is not technically possible will not be replaced
no hour bistro like tui no alcohol at breakfast eg no champagne breakfast possible bad internet eg login error high internet costs lots of rust spots on the deck and balconies year old ship
we only started our cruises in and to date we have done over with aida and unfortunately it is getting worse and worse and we notice that in many places they are cutting costs in the wrong places it is not all bad but we have noticed a lot of things and unfortunately found them negative the main thing here is the incredible unfriendliness of the crew we unfortunately had bad experiences in many places and examples on our last trip and the child friendliness activities and activities have declined significantly
the service from all the staff and the excursions etc were all very good
organization of the trip very well many passengers on the ship restaurants often very full
positive organization friendliness of service staff cleanliness quality food varied entertainment program theatrium fitness studio etc negative guests have virtually no opportunity to choose which restaurant they want to eat in you have to eat where there is space sometimes there is no space left the bed linen is clean but there is a strong smell coming from the inside of the pillowsblankets sweat it is full and you can tell some additional costs drinks shuttle internet tv etc
everything was very well organized staff on the ship and on shore excursions spoke german the food was varied and delicious the entertainment program on board was really good
highquality equipment extremely clean great very tasty varied food great shows and events friendly committed and funny crew a dream vacation that is worth the money
great holiday courteous treatment nice helpful crew clean cabin top
very nice trip we were there during the easter holidays the food was too full will stay next time
everything around everything was great except that the prices needed to be adjusted a bit to suit families
unfortunately the aida is now too full especially during the holidays hurdle race at the buffet quality not very high angry staff drink package contents simply not on board etc
the ship aidanova is great the food was very good but the service no consideration for the severely handicapped no reimbursement of the excursion costs even though aida was indirectly to blame for the fact that my husband was so exhausted after a bus ride on a broken bus the ventilation was broken the temperature was degrees children were throwing up that he could no longer go and had to sit at the bus seat to recover aida would have refunded the price if we had called an ambulance very funny in london they would have taken him to hospital and of course we would have gone with them my husband is asthmatic and is extremely exhausted after such stress but he doesnt need to go straight to the hospital he just needs to rest and recover really sad that a company like this reacts like this
goodwill and customer orientation are foreign words here rebooking a cabin is not possible regardless of whether you are a regular customer they insist on the terms and conditions a load of rubbish last time i booked there
i have pointed out several times that wine and beer are sporadically and for no apparent reason stopped serving in the buffet restaurant despite repeated warnings every buffet did what it wanted aidas own contractual promises are irrelevant to the onboard staff
you just have to like vacationing with germans if you want spontaneity and no jostling for places on board restaurants wellness entertainment excursions etc you should go with another shipping company the payment policy on board also takes some getting used to the entertainment program and the service on board were good
the organization the food and the drinks package
the al kart restaurants rossini and the vegan on the nova are highly recommended
the price does not match the service unfriendly staff quality of some food and drinks was badfruit and eggs
we are currently on the aida quotstellaquot transvoyage from gran canaria to mallorca it is well known that aida has unfortunately deteriorated significantly in all areas in recent years and is also being criticized more and more often here but what the passengers are expected to endure today on easter monday in the normal buffet restaurants can only be described as abysmal this was by far the worst thing i have experienced in many years on aida terrible
completely overpriced excursions that are also poorly organized
food entertainment
great ship mostly great staff but completely overcrowded so that you usually have to book restaurants and activities in advance of the trip on land
stop building such large ships its about nature and the cities that are called at the ship seems like centerparks to me with little comfort in the cabins lots of space for children and activities and a pure moneyprinting machine unbelievable
develop lounger concept improve restaurant booking concept
the ship was completely overcrowded during the easter holidays there was a queue no matter where you went watching a show if you hadnt been there at least an hour beforehand to have somewhere to sit was not possible theatrium was completely overcrowded and the air was incredibly bad the pool areas were also packed with people no regulation of the crowds the pool area was far too cold for small children the mini area where kids in swim diapers were allowed was an absolute joke and far too cold for the little ones the kids club was also only available with a waiting time beforehand and queuing during the day there was no chance of finding a place to play a game with the children because everything was taken endless waiting times at the bar for two drinks after ordering it could easily take minutes this was our th cruise with aida and the conclusion never again on holiday a real shame for a family ship
outside of the holiday season we always had good experiences there unfortunately we are now dependent on the holiday season and would therefore not book an aida cruise again we were glad when we were finally back home the ship in our case the cosma was simply too full too loud it was like mass processing the spa area offers little relaxation no place to lie outside because it was too full which is of course very sad when you have booked time for relaxation there is little peace and quiet in the spa area a door is constantly opening and closing somewhere passengers are too loud i wont even start on the fight at the buffet the pool deck is nice but here too you are seated close together assuming you get a seat this is the last time we have booked for now this is not how we imagined our cruise would be
from the picturesque beauty of norway to the immaculate amenities on board the aidanova this trip was an allround successful adventure for me and my son the buffet restaurant exceeded expectations with its variety and quality each meal was a culinary experience that delighted us time and time again another highlight is the excellent service staff whose attentiveness and professionalism left nothing to be desired we were particularly impressed by the specialty restaurant rossini whose offering and ambience are in no way inferior to a michelinstar restaurant from the reservation to the dessert every moment was a delight the crews ability to communicate information clearly and promptly made boarding and disembarkation a smooth process which further increased the comfort of the trip the cleanliness on board deserves its own praise everything was always impeccably maintained and hygienic this high standard contributed significantly to us feeling safe and comfortable at all times in summary this trip to norway with the aidanova was an unforgettable experience for both of us the combination of breathtaking landscapes outstanding food excellent service and exemplary cleanliness completely won us over we will definitely travel with aida again many thanks to everyone involved for this wonderful experience
very well organized team our ship was standard
far too many cabins on the ship too many decks and far too low ceilings in cabins bathrooms and corridors you have to queue everywhere sometimes for more than half an hour suitcases take too long to arrive half a day is lost beds too narrow for tall people cabins too small just so that more cabins can fit on a ship and maximum money can be made ship is mainly aimed at families with children no possibility of walking without barriers on the ship on sea days overcrowding at the pools and on the decks on sea days unfortunately the adult pool is also full of children towel reservations already on the move before am far too full in the buffet restaurants walked through restaurants on the day of arrival and only then found a single table completely dirty benches and chairs in the restaurants there is no peace in the la carte restaurants either as the whole crowd runs through the restaurants and screams shops open too late lanai bar overcrowded smokers everywhere no service endless queuing to get a drink aperol spritz with huge ice cubes and still only ml in total sips and it was empty
i would sum it up as a mass population attitude without holiday enjoyment if you like arguing with people at am about sunbeds or arguing with the restaurant management about far too few places in the la carte restaurants then this is the place for you there are regularly more than twice as many people in the pools as stated but most children are happy with m of space and a bit of murky water doesnt matter on sea days you should be mobile enough to be able to take big steps over your fellow passengers you lie down wherever m is free for us this ship is a complete disaster its all about the mass processing of thousands of passengers never again positive the asian staff in particular are very friendly and courteous the food and drink is ok but thats about it
pretty much everything the catering concept on the cosma is a disaster queues upon queues and getting a table for people was a daily stress point rushing to the restaurant to have a chance
everything was good except that i wish there was more seafood in the food and free internet on board
far too crowded and understaffed problems like broken tv were not dealt with and sometimes too expensive massage and sauna far too expensive
completely overcrowded ship poor service too high prices
aida cosma was unfortunately a disappointment service and food quality were far below average but the prices were sometimes steep for me many of the old aida values were lost here and unfortunately the prices were far too high
clean tidy perfect organization of processes always friendly staff mega good food
unfortunately aida has now moved towards quantity rather than quality always the same food and waiters who practically beg for tips so that you just feel uncomfortable never again aida
aida cannot be topped when it comes to service i only deducted one point because the pool on aida prima was simply too small and above all the water level was too low it was only intended for children and reserving the loungers on deck really annoyed us something definitely needs to be done about that
the cabin is nice but the service at the bars is so terrible waiting once is ok but waiting minutes three times in a row for a drink is not ok if you offer premium allinclusive you have to offer the service
quotorient with oman from dubaiquot was the name of our day cruise on the aidaprima the organizational aspects such as checkin luggage transport arrivaldeparture went smoothly we were given the impression that we were welcome the food was firstclass and left little to be desired in the restaurants included in the price of the trip we of course did not visit any restaurants for cash why pay twice even when you are on vacation thats where the scotsman in me comes out we had booked the shore excursions in advance and they were well organized unfortunately aida employee mario s was inappropriate in his tone with other guests i had to experience this on a shore excursion its not acceptable what is also not acceptable is the socalled m jogging track on deck or this is blocked by sun loungers blocked by nonathletes and leads past doors that can be opened at any time and are therefore a danger to the runners what were they thinking nighttime rest was also only possible to a limited extent noise pollution from the air conditioning and ventilation in the showertoilet that cannot be turned off makes a restful sleep impossible other guests confirmed this another negative point in my view is the dress code in the evening there are signs that say quotgive your favorite shorts a break long trousers in the evening in the restaurantquot i personally have no problem with the dress code but what is annoying is that when signs are put up guests in shorts and flipflops have to be asked to leave or the signs have to be removed if i set rules they should be implemented or i dont need rules enough complaining on to the positive if you have any questions just call and you will get help straight away the climbing garden was good and at euros it is a fair price the tv provides information about the trip onboard account etc and offers german tv channels i would also like to mention the hammock on the balcony as a positive as well as the entertainment in the theater and the large fitness area basically a gym finally a tip regarding shore excursions we were lucky with the weather but i recommend booking shore excursions on the aida the price remains the same but you have more flexibility if the weather doesnt play along
it was a great first trip on the ship and our expectations were exceeded great food super service and organization
the guest is not really the king as everything is offered at too high a price such as wellness and ala carte restaurants by the way the shows were very good but the band in the aida bar was awful the singer doesnt know the lyrics and her voice doesnt reach the guests and the corioration is the same a shame there were some very good bands the crew is very good with their performances
friendliness magic nice service team event organization on board simple and helpful childrens entertainment very good varied dishes great wellness area will recommend
far too many people are crammed onto the ship the table wine was no longer drinkable after four days the only solution would have been to try a different wine which you would have to pay for it was not possible to book an a la carte restaurant on board
our first trip on a ship was to be on the aida prima full of excitement about what was to await us we boarded a cruise ship for the first time in dubai wow a floating hotel checkin went smoothly and quickly nice staff etc now it was here the moment had come to view the cabin with a view of the water after the initial quotokay its bearable herequot there followed a humming loud probably running engine noise what was that we are certainly not sensitive to noise not least because of our jobs but this monotonous loud humming was to accompany us for days and nights no definitely not i said in second thought it will certainly be off in the evening or better to be prepared and quickly go to reception and check whether the noise is known of course not which we could hardly imagine they promised to remedy the situation after all how else are you supposed to sleep next to an quotenginequot in the neighborhood after a good dinner and a nice show we went back to our cabin to get some rest for the night the quotenginequot could already be heard in the hallway after about hours of futile efforts including cotton wool in our ears my wife had had enough and went to reception again am unfortunately no remedy has been found so far only my wifes determined attitude with the threat that we would leave the ship if we had to keep this cabin for our money allowed the nice lady at reception to assign us a new cabin for the night so we moved with the child in the night in unfamiliar ship corridors the next morning only the air conditioning hummed in the silence of the night but this is completely fine and not at all disturbing for us after consulting reception we were able to keep the new cabin the adventure of the cruise could now start under a good star the good star stayed with us for the entire trip the crew right down to the cabin service is a great team we always felt at ease i had expected that the adventure ship also has restrictions regarding beach chairs on deck lots of people at dinner etc and it was bearable with this new knowledge we would book a cruise with aida best wishes janine basti and matheo
great checkin organization very nice and friendly staff unfortunately the cutlery was quite dirty some of the tables were very dirty which was different from my first nova trip lots of stained carpets great ports very good organization of the entire process and an excellent chip shop with the most delicious belgian fries and tasty sauces on deck
im deducting one star because the restaurants are always full in the evenings regardless of what time they open and waiting for a seat isnt nice but its also because some guests eat dinner for hours the free wine is to blame for that
great cruise super friendly staff perfectly organized if the towel mafia at the pool could be put to an end it would get stars
we were on the cosma on the canary islands tour the ship was at its capacity limit with just under guests which was noticeable everywhere no free loungers fighting for seats at the shows a long search for free seats in the restaurants often having to look for plates or certain dishes were only slowly refilled at the bars you can easily wait minutes for a simple drink as the bar staff take orders at random they also seem very stressed because there are too few staff at the bars even when there was less going on at the bars it sometimes took just as long because staff had been taken off accordingly the concept is really bad at some point you didnt even feel like getting a drink anymore because of the waiting times the room service the quality of the food the photo flat rate were all very good the ship has potential but not recommended when it is full
quality of food and drinks very good inside cabin for people clearly too small about square meters the restaurants could not cope with the rush of travelers
food was always cold
great food beautiful ship simply amazing
quantity instead of quality never again aida my trip on the aidacosma canary islands route positive very competent extremely friendly staff on all levels info point cleaning staff bar staff restaurant staff very tasty food negative an insane number of holidaymakers on board according to a crew member it was constantly a struggle to get places in the restaurants as well as loungers or chairs on sea days an extremely high noise level in the restaurant queues everywhere at the buffets i had the impression of being in a chicken coop or dovecote on deck the passengers were lying close together like herrings it was difficult to follow evening programs theatrical because crowds upon crowds blocked the view i was on the cosma for week and the relaxation value was zero never again really a message to the bosses at aida only let a maximum of passengers on the ship then it will be bearable minimize the number of paid restaurants they werent busy enough anyway so the crowds can be better distributed at mealtimes after me federal states had holidays and according to a crew member there were passengers on board i asked him what the point of making the ship so full was and he suddenly turned away i hope word gets around about whats going on on these aida mega ships maybe something will change
we travelled on the aida diva it was a struggle every day to even get a table no matter what time of day or which restaurant when we did get a table someone always had to guard it otherwise it would have gone again so eating together was out of the question the buffets meant that you were just pushed through and there were endless queues by the time we finally got to our table the food was almost cold the staff couldnt keep up with clearing away and so we often sat at dirty tables with lots of dirty dishes the spoons for refilling the food at the buffet were greasy and sticky which was not nice the friendly staff couldnt smile away either the guests were all totally stressed and in a bad mood the excursions were expensive and the staff were in a bad mood and gave rude answers i was really annoyed lots of people complained when we booked an excursion with people i assumed we would sit together this was not the case we were torn apart i was unlucky enough to have to sit next to a woman who was so big she would have needed two seats that i couldnt even sit properly and got off the bus with back pain once on aida and never again
the good thing about my experience is that i will not book on such a large ship again the aidacosma is a great ship but there are too many guests on board we had a veranda comfort cabin with a walkin closet just great i can recommend the market restaurant less crowding and you can always find a place sunbeds on deck are still reserved even though it is forbidden some guests also smoked in the nonsmoking area no checks
last year we travelled to great britain and norway on the aida sol everything on this trip and on the ship was great and perfect we were very impressed which is why we decided to book a transtrip this year from la romana to hamburg on the aida diva unfortunately the whole holiday and the weeks were a complete disaster the ship was not clean unhygienic and in a very shabby state dirty towels bath towels bed linen with holes in it the carpet was full of stains chocolate fingers on the walls bad and dry air from the ventilation system lots of dust in the room whole wooden edges from the wooden floor were sticking out on the pool deck everything was rusty etc the wellness area was extremely dirty the whirlpool was ice cold and the staff were very unfriendly in general the staff on the diva were very annoyed demotivated listless grumpy and unfriendly a few positive exceptions were the staff at the beach bar a gentleman at the reception and the cleaning staff who were always friendly dining tables were almost always dirty from the previous person and these were never cleaned by the staff toilets were dirty almost everywhere and in days i never saw a toilet locked for cleaning the quality of the food has declined enormously especially with meat and sausage sometimes there was food on the buffet that already had feet on it liver sausage meat salad etc it felt like the same thing was in every container and on every deck every day i first caught a stomach virus on the ship and then we caught corona and brought it home with us after about weeks there was only constant coughing and sniffling on all sides of the ship there was no escape unfortunately aida did nothing at all here no measures such as the use of masks disposable gloves mandatory hand disinfection dividing food into smaller groups at the buffet or food being served by staff sending extremely sick passengers into quarantine and whatever other options there are the passengers were impossible you cant miss a free meal its better to reach the forks at the buffet when youre sick and cough into every container in the buffet always pushing your way through no manners and then constantly refilling private bottles at the drinks machines in the restaurants which should be strictly prohibited due to hygiene regulations but which didnt matter on this ship anyway or securing free cocktails for other guests and reserving loungers that werent used for hours we sometimes stopped eating altogether or if we did it was for a maximum of minutes far too bad air and constant coughing and stayed away from the evening events as it felt like only sick people were there in the market restaurant its now the same in some seating areas only those who slip the waitresses bills get a table reserved straight away if you sit in one of these areas you wont be offered coffee water or wine dirty plates arent cleared away and you only get angry looks from the waiters and waitresses the quality of the evening events has dropped significantly due to the illness of some artists some of them were even cancelled completely but i understand that on days when tendering was used chaos and stress broke out within the crew even though there were hardly any waves this definitely needs to be practiced the excursions are far too expensive too short and would be better booked on your own or through a third party its a shame about all the money the vacation and your health we are really very disappointed with aida quantity alone shouldnt be everything class should not be completely forgotten
unacceptably small veranda cabin for two people for two weeks steel walls on the veranda just creak and squeak some of the expensive excursions booked through aida were very dangerous and unpleasant
enjoy your meal
everything was very well organized from the flight transfer checkin checkout restaurants excursions
the quality of the drinks and food leaves a lot to be desired
the friendliness of the crew and the service staff as well as the cleanliness in all areas you hardly saw the quotlittle elvesquot but everything was still tiptop
positives the feeling of a cruise on a really beautiful ship with a friendly crew and very nice service staff you can eat around the clock the children have lots of options to keep them occupied also great childcare service nice lounge for suite guests great spa options for him and her great selection of bars and restaurants cozy corners everywhere and the theatrium as the center is a highlight the ritual with the music when setting sail the equipment on aida cosma is simply beautiful even on sea days it doesnt get boring on the ship great vacation option for families theres something for everyone negatives poor flow of information by what time do you have to book different times restaurants open on different days no introduction to the process what is where what is important a lot of things are assumed to be quotselfevidentquot and quotknownquot all information is available via the onboard app but it keeps crashing you have to log in again every time simply annoying the internet is not just bad it simply doesnt exist only through additional costs per day no clear labeling of paid drinks at bars that are not included in the drinks package hardly any variety at the buffet restaurants especially at breakfast not enough pancakes for such large numbers always mushy watermelons practically all restaurants are fully booked from the start overpriced excursions thirdparty providers are more than half as expensive my recommendation for anyone taking a cruise with aida for the first time watch videos on youtube to prepare yourself as best as possible for the trip and to find your way around the ship i can imagine that a second trip will go more smoothly
the asia route was well thought out and impressive the ship aidabella had its charm although it needed modernization the tours we booked were informative and entertaining but overpriced due to the lack of preparation time for the new guests our bathroom was not cleaned upon arrival and the ship was not very inviting the food was delicious and varied but we missed theme evenings about the countries we visited hygiene was a big problem at the end of the tour all passengers were sick since you were not allowed to order to your room feedback from reception isolation was not possible and you were forced to use the restaurants considering the priceperformance ratio we will try other providers in the future
it was our first trip with aida and probably our last zero customer orientation mass processing and the worst food i have eaten in a long time upgrade trap when booking with a ripoff scam to get rid of unpopular cabins the main thing is to transport masses even if on the wrong ship for the respective travel area hidden costs everywhere and all inclusive is definitely not all inclusive food for the masses without taste is the motto and quality only for an additional charge on site productive and relevant communication with the customer is out of place aida excursions are sinfully expensive and promises of onsite experiences and exclusivity are not kept for us this one weeks vacation was more expensive than our honeymoon of almost three weeks and i have not eaten so badly and experienced so little customer orientation as with aida for a long time therefore i will not recommend this provider at all the only thing that was good was the service from the service staff on board waiters cleaners and bar staff they tried to do everything within their means working horrendous hours with hardly any breaks
perfect organization of the trip from a to z some things are overpriced but thats the case everywhere when youre on the high seas and there are no alternatives to the bars and restaurants on board i thought it was a shame that you couldnt buy drinks in sealed bottles to consume on the balcony eg liter bottles of zwickl beer i would have liked to have one or two of those in the evening on the balcony of my cabin perhaps aida should rethink the concept they already have all the prerequisites for it on board and if you charge the same price per liter as at the bars you dont lose any money as a result
great trip to the canary islands first time on the cosma everything went really well only the packing density at the buffet restaurants was relatively high but we managed to get this under control by finding alternatives and optimizing the timing nevertheless stars for the logistical masterpiece transfers checkin excursions bar service great food perfect
together with a friend i made the winter trip in the far north on the aidasol on the twoweek tour through norway we remembered the ship being very clean and tidy we had an inside cabin in the front area on deck and were completely satisfied however we heard from other guests that you have to put up with a lot of noise from the machines in the back area another positive thing was an excursion that we booked through aida in alesund the ship waited for us because we were a bit late nevertheless the excursions and especially the shuttle buses that were necessary in some cities were outrageously expensive one negative point for aida was unfortunately the food which was not designed for vegetarians there was a choice of pasta or rice but unfortunately the sauces were made with meat the temperatures on board were also disappointing without warmer clothes or a blanket it was sometimes unbearable there even in the theatrium overall we still enjoyed it very much and would book another trip
we were really looking forward to our second aida cruise after we were so excited about our first cruise in unfortunately we were disappointed this time the ship was completely overcrowded there was no room in the restaurants or on the loungers the dishes and cutlery were often dirty and last but not least we also caught a stomach bug
overcrowded restaurants an absolute disaster complaining and stressed guests everywhere you look far too few staff in every area of the ship for the number of people traveling broken items everywhere you look almost every piece of gaming equipment is broken childrens playground equipment is broken some elevators are permanently broken and there are far too few for the number of people dartboard broken etc etc etc the bars are so overcrowded that you have to wait up to minutes and hope that your drinks will arrive the staff in all service positions deserve a positive mention always friendly and hardworking but unfortunately overwhelmed due to understaffing
everything was very well organized the food and facilities were great and the service was friendly
we have traveled with aida many times and have had little reason to complain we can always recommend aida when it comes to the food the crew and the entertainment
i imagined the caribbean to be different i hardly ever dived and saw fish only overcrowded beaches sunbeds and umbrellas cost money everywhere
we really liked the variety of things to do on the ship one negative aspect was having to reserve tables in the specialty restaurants in advance as some passengers do this months before the trip for all the restaurants on the ship at the same time and then often dont show up this means you hardly have the opportunity to make your own reservations and get to know the specialty restaurants
it was our th aida trip the staff the service the food simply brilliant
your kitchen on board is optimal
significant food shortages unfortunately the last trip with the aidaluna caribbean to hamburg was a nuisance in terms of food the offerings in the selfservice restaurants were very onesided there was hardly any variety which would have been urgently needed on the many days at sea in addition the food was mostly only lukewarm towards the end of the trip not everything was available the knuckle of pork in the quotalmhttequot still very good at the beginning was served without bones days before the end of the trip a fairly small piece of meat lay loose in the rind thats how you make or out of one knuckle of pork unfortunately i didnt think to take a photo but there are witnesses furthermore the preferred wine pinot blanc was no longer available this is particularly annoying if you have treated yourself to an expensive drinks package i can only advise everyone against it despite the usual friendly crew this trip was not a recommendation for aida cruises peteg
first of all the onboard language in german and all essential information the contact between crew and guests is relaxed and pleasant
we have been on an aida ship many times we have never had a bad experience our last trip on the cosma will definitely stay in our memory because the food in the restaurants was of high quality
as a nonsmoker booking a balcony cabin i do not want to spend my expensive trip between two smokers
star for the great food star for cleanliness star for the excursions unfortunately super overpriced star for the way the service staff at the bars dealt with the conditions and distribution of free drinks star for information reception and timely communication to the guest
the crew is very friendly and communicative absolutely extensive selection of food and leisure activities very clean and well maintained
a great trip top servicestaff on board good food but in my opinion the excursions were too expensive
too crowded the food was mediocre except for the overbooked specialty restaurants whether breakfast lunch or dinner in the buffet restaurants it was just stressful the specialty restaurants only have limited capacity the premium package cocktails were not good the veranda cabin on deck was thin on sound the staff did their best but couldnt keep up with the crowds
too many passengers entertainment satisfactory
another lovely cruise already th of them with aida the cosma is a big ship but you can tell that the cosma is just new however the buffet restaurants are too full if you go to eat at the wrong time some additional costs such as the sauna would be nice if they werent so high and some things like a scoop of ice cream could be free stars because the additional costs are just too high such as for the sauna
the ship is simply too big passengers is too many long waiting times in the restaurants on sea days and no place on deck service was good very nice staff some of the food was not so good especially in the buffet restaurants
staff service as well as food were topnotch but unfortunately this trip did not quite meet our expectations be it the accessibility of the sports area or spa for our daughter years old or spontaneously renting an ebike on a shore excursion ok it is clear that the ship cannot take bicycles but perhaps a certain number can be kept back for those who decide at short notice or a cooperation with providers in the ports even the number of pools on the nova cannot hide the fact that they are all smaller pools where swimming is not necessarily possible in summer i would definitely take a balcony cabin we had a cabin with a sea view airing out would be great because the air conditioning does its best to either make you freeze or get a headache or just give a precise description and finally the corona tip yes corona still exists please inform guests as early as possible
totally overcrowded chaos at mealtimes no more specialty restaurants bookable during the trip
bad food and crowded restaurants internet doesnt work well no swimming pool sea day only had hours slot for sauna crowd was mass is class
cleanliness is a very important issue on the ship i caught pneumonia on the ship i went to the doctor on the day of departure but it didnt help me and i should report it
i have no idea whats going on with aida but this holiday was disappointing and different to what were used to from aida unfriendly hosts dirty dishes at the buffet no chance of ordering more than two drinks in the evening because there arent enough staff so theres no need to book allinclusive above deck all the loungers were set up every morning and pulled across the floor sleeping was out of the question all information is now only available digitally
problems arriving due to a strike but to be told that aida doesnt have a flight to munich and that we should figure out how to get there ourselves we didnt like that answer at all the flight to barbedos was confirmed though evening entertainment there was nothing for us in the theater what a pity
positive the snacks free at pier to take with you on the excursions fast friendly checkin very overpriced excursions whose only goal seems to be to make money rushy cabin service uncaring everything has to be paid for extra when renting a coffee machine i also expect coffee milk and that it is emptiedcleaned for
thanks to the service staff everyone was very accommodating the organization of excursions could be improved
lots of dirt bad food hardly any entertainment the wine was completely gone
we had wonderful days on the caribbean islands were wonderfully looked after in a clean cabin were able to enjoy the sound of the waves and the great views and always felt very comfortable it was a cozy retreat on the sea the cleaning was done discreetly and regularly this time we particularly enjoyed our stays in the restaurants the healthy fresh and varied selection that was important to us was always available this time we were particularly impressed by the top service in all the catering areas and bars our wellbeing was taken care of with exceptional friendliness
cabin selected by aida with obstruction and noise this could not be upgraded people who booked after us with the same aida tariff got better balcony cabins amidships large drinks package booked because of coffee unfortunately a flopp not a portafilter machine on board coffee only with boarding pass at two machines that often didnt work or cups were missing
beautiful ship well thoughtout cabin furnishings delicious food wellorganized excursions friendly staff good value for money
disorganized excursions booking information absolutely overpriced food like in the canteen drinks at the bar long waiting times despite enough staff and few guests drafty in the quotrestaurantsquot leisure activities very clear and hardly an attractive selection in the evening confusing signage none available daily information out of stock incomprehensible with paid drinks ice cream bar chargeable despite drinks package and full board short layover times at the ports travel times too long despite short distances on the quotparty islandquot the quotfoodquot wraps nothing else were all gone after minutes but paid drinks were still available and absolutely overpriced despite drinks package announcements not audible everywhere internet constantly down but staff very good
we were on the aida nova for days it was our first cruise and on such a large ship which scared me a little considering the number of passengers but i was proven wrong you didnt notice how many people there were it was a lovely week everything was perfect we will book aida again but on a smaller ship the only thing i have to complain about is that glass bottles were being handled in and around the whirlpool since there are lots of small children running around barefoot in this area too you should make sure that this doesnt happen
as a time participant on an aida cruise i can see very clearly that savings are being made on food
delicious food super friendly staff you feel very well looked after
we went on our first cruise to the north cape on the aidasol sphinx class we had many experiences including the following with aida positive it is impossible to name all of the positive aspects so i will only mention the most important ones for us which impressed us and which we were very happy about mostly very friendly staff wide range of options on board for accommodation food and drinks entertainment activities peace and quiet tasty drinks at the bars cocktails coffee large selection of dishes in the restaurants cake selection in the aida bar free training options in the fitness area wide range of offers in the atrium daily information on the daily program and events myaida today free city maps at the ports impeccable cleanliness cabin cleaning restaurants bars toilets luggage transport no smoking indoors food in small portions eg small pieces of cake this means you can try lots of things without eating too much very good sound insulation apart from the engine and ventilation noise there is no noise pollution in the cabin negative aida never misses an opportunity to make money you need nerves to always avoid it or ignore it intrusive silly advertising i find the kissing mouth embarrassing completely overpriced and very bad excursions as far as we booked them through aida incompetent tour guide poor organization queuing for buses ridiculous events mediocre quality of the food in the vast majority of holiday hotels that i have visited so far there was better food
very friendly and helpful staff delicious food and almost too much choice the whole ship was very clean we will definitely go on another cruise soon
trip was good and bad experience too many people on board crowds at every buffet restaurant no table etc available too many small children on board absolutely no peace and quiet children screaming everywhere food was quite good but not outstanding ship offers good entertainment specialty restaurants only with advance reservation are very good service in general could be better more attentive
overall this is the fifth and last time we have been on aida the clientele has become difficult probably because of the price that is why we are going to change shipping companies the decline in the quality of such a trip is clearly noticeable for us we travelled on the nova a beautiful ship i must say however the rules set by aida itself are not enforced by the staff during the safety drill more people had life jackets in their hands than were wearing them no one on our station was interested in the evening in the theatrium the specially designated seats for the severely handicapped were besieged by nonhandicapped people and no one was interested here either the civil warlike conditions in the buffet restaurant were the last straw for us the clientele on this trip quickly exhausted the tolerance threshold its a shame aida used to be something special and you had the feeling you were coming home now some guests think it is their ship they put their feet barefoot on the chairs in the bars seats like quotbathing loungersquot are reserved with all sorts of things most of them are not able to serve themselves properly at a buffet there are plates from the kebab station and empty glasses everywhere in the corridors at the bar the person with the biggest elbows and whoever makes the loudest noise is served smokers have taken over the entire upper deck and declared it a smoking area sayings like quotthe days of queuing are overquot are often heard the staff are all friendly i think aida is at a crossroads between ballermann and nolimts and without rules at a bargain price or a quality holiday with the corresponding standards at the moment i see more of the former
everyone was always very friendly especially in the ocean bar
great ship super clean whether the cabin or the bars everything clean
everything was great but a few employees were unable to give correct information due to language barriers there were too few opportunities to avoid the many children there were so many sick people on board that i got sick myself otherwise everything was great
we have booked trips on various aida ships since the first small ships and the first trips were very nice then came the larger ones and thats when the dilemma began the quality of the food got worse and worse meal times were split into two times where you dont have enough time and are asked to go outside in the pizzeria you are immediately asked for your cabin card because you even have to pay for water there used to always be a carafe on the table the trips are getting more and more expensive and the service worse package trips including flights are also offered less and less often we used to be so enthusiastic that we took around to friends and acquaintances with us all of whom have already taken several trips with aida all of them without exception are of the same opinion as us and are now traveling with mein schiff and we are going to try it out now too
not bad food could be better service is good
the change from the smaller ships we had previously traveled on sol mar to the nova of the helios class was more or less a complete disappointment in terms of the priceperformance ratio on the ship far too many passengers on board with too few seats in the restaurants everything was crowded at the buffets the staff were probably too few so they were unmotivated listless and inattentive it was our only and last trip on a ship of the helios class of aida nova cosma
the cosma is a beautiful modern ship an experience although it can carry passengers you hardly notice it due to the size of the ship only on a sea day the sun deck is crowded when the weather is sunny the cabins are functionally furnished and equipped with modern amenities we had a balcony cabin with a large balcony the beds sleep well there are many interactive screens throughout the ship where almost all information can be accessed there is a lot to do on the ship nice sports facilities nice shops casino many activities for children swimming pools you name it most of the restaurants are beautifully designed and the food is high quality and varied the waiters and cabin staff are friendly helpful and do a good job our captain of the ship tommy mller seems personable has a sense of humor and provides useful information for the guests on a daily basis during the nautical hour he explains how to operate the ship and you can ask questions very educational in short we had a very nice cruise holiday and the ship the cosma is recommended
finally go on a cool aida cruise all of our former young fellow cruisers and the travel agency wanted to persuade us to go on quotyoungquot cruises in reality everything seemed a little different on the aidaluna the condition of the ship the passengers on the aidaluna were offputting the service was mediocre and the food was far below what we were used to from meinschiff the point mentioned about the pricepackage culture in particular put us off if i book the premium ai package then i dont want to pay anything extra but expect an unlimited choice of drinks comparable to meinschiff the way the food was served was of poorer quality and so quotrestrictivequot why cant i have breakfast somewhere at quarter to twelve on a sea day where is the ice cream bar why cant i have a snack between and where can i even get a snack why am i constantly thrown out of restaurants as an ai customer because i might spend too long at the tap where is a gtgtquietltlt order restaurant for couples without an ikea atmosphere with normal included food there is only buffet food or expensive premium food not a good upper middle class you can see that from the pensioners in short jeans and tank tops who keep squeezing in between the buffet wooden spoons or pseudopremium what we noticed negatively where is the advertised pool bar with water one reason why we decided to take the caribbean cruise on the luna plus some disgusting and unkempt corners on the ship sometimes only one premium coffee machine for three restaurants minutes waiting funny a woman gets premium coffees for her fellow travelers who dont have any packages its annoying when you go to breakfast at quarter past queue for minutes for a coffee get dirty looks from the numerous pensioners when you want to sit down in the full restaurant and then when youre seated youre reminded to leave again in minutes the best breakfast was on the sunday after the cruise when we were finally able to have breakfast at half past without stress if you book a premium ai package you also want to drink your really cold beer at the table its stupid when the predominant beer isnt there for days and if you complain youre not offered a corona from the neighboring restaurant but nonalcoholic beer and the offer to cancel the package and pay for everything separately there were also personal restrictions a toilet overflowing in the middle of the night with poor cleaning that constantly caused problems a quotshittyquot room the missed cleaning on the first day at sea and always waiting queuing and arguing on vacation no allergens in the food that could lead to allergic reactions meal times and some waiter behavior like in a youth hostel some ideas why do qualified reception staff and officers constantly have to tell pensioners how to set up their internet cant the quotdigital nativesquot from the event sector do that perhaps as an event when it comes to complaints you should look at how you can filter out quotfirst worldquot problems like quotmy whale watching tour was cancelled because of the sea conditions in the azores thats outrageous and serious problems my cabin is full of shit stains and i cant stay there without it seeming disinterested the goodwill rules for the employees on the ship should be improved depending on the excursion give a drink a delicious meal or sauna access and real mistakes should be dealt with properly and not with a sauna voucher overall with the condition of the ship it seems as if aida is being ruined by costcutting or is on the verge of bankruptcy the competition gave chocolates worth euros for their birthdays a couple who were awarded at an evening event for years of marriage received drink vouchers we look back on our cruise for euros with mixed feelings apart from a few good evening shows a a few good waiters and bartenders hardly any positive memories the experiences at the destinations were in our hands and unique
the high additional surcharges for drinks and in restaurants
the staff was super friendly and helpful cleanliness was top notch it wasnt our last vacation on the aida we met a lot of nice people
we had cabins very nice and nice staff super nice and very friendly
trips to the dolphins in dubai via aida are simply too expensive and there is not much on offer we went snorkelling it was a disaster the boat driver stopped right in the coral reef and a woman had injured herself so snorkelling was out of the question for us the food was a lounge package sandwiches apple and a small
unfortunately there were a few cases of illness on board the shipping company cannot be blamed for this per se but it did greatly reduce the enjoyment of the holiday as people disembarked ill
the ship was fully booked it was almost claustrophobic the bathing center was always overcrowded
the preparation of meals and the service should be reconsidered
food is worse than in a canteen in the service restaurant you get the main course before the starter while others at the table are already eating dessert coffee from starbucks is cold the complaint was more or less ignored but coffee was charged shore excursions are disorganized but a photographer is always present in the buffet restaurant guests block the tables because wine is free with meals cocktails are definitely not a strong point either at any bar aida tries to make money by any means possible no matter what the cost
unfriendly condescending reception worn out furnishings no good excursions
we liked the route but we shouldnt skimp any further on the food
aidacosma huge ship huge crowds in the general restaurants not our thing sometimes great service then again a desert of service clean service in the cabins no information when checking in suddenly we were on the ship and had no idea about anything and that was on the st cruise
overall i was satisfied if the comments such as the organization of arrival and the checkin were better i would be very satisfied everyone was very friendly and helped when there was a problem
more restaurants with service would be desirable
entry conditions and implementation of the immigration process in the various ports of the countries with incredibly long queues the restaurants markt and weite welt are no longer up to date with their cafeteria or canteen character request for change change in the process of entry controls passengers are processed through one exit several exits should be available here the catering concept should be adapted to be similar to the cosma prima
booked a norway tour from hamburg for days luckily not longer the whole trip is not in any priceperformance comparison daily struggle to survive as all restaurants are overcrowded even alacart is difficult to book constant noise from children guests with difficult levels luckily access to the aidalonge as it is a bit quieter there at the end of the trip i caught a stomach virus as the guests absolutely did not adhere to hygiene for us the slogan is aida never again
yes because the receptionist didnt take our problem with the noise caused by the creaking plastic wall above the balcony door seriously we were told to use earplugs overnight she also said we could pick some up from reception we would have had to get dressed again because it was already midnight
aidascosma do not book a cabin with a balcony on deck and cabins are located directly next to the brewery noise and bed vibration included until pm
good service waiters housekeeping nice excursions interesting program on board
the service on deck was great the room service was below the belt they dont even leave you alone even if the do not disturb sign is hanging on the handle outside privacy is important to me i dont want someone standing in my room when im relaxing for a bit
the great service and friendliness of the crew as well as the good selection of food and drinks
the ship was simply too big for us as a result checking in and out took far too long i found the prices for the mystery room to be very overpriced the cake in the afternoon used to be much better but this time it seemed to come from the freezer and it was always the same cakes
i have been travelling through the caribbean and europe on the aidadiva for days now it is no longer bearable my cabin which costs euros for days including the outbound flight is on deck is m and has a window however the window always has to be kept closed as strangers are constantly walking past and the tender boats are being pulled up and down but i paid extra for the sea view the metre ceiling height in the room puts a damper on the mood you can hear engine noise hours a day i dont think rooms like this should be offered they are harmful to your health despite a drinks package for euros you have to buy bottled water for even for the cabin no entertainers socalled discos start at pm and end at pm as the music does not meet guests expectations the disco room is empty very quickly boring you have to pay extra for the restaurant otherwise you go to the selfservice buffet the choice of food is very limited i dont recommend it
would like to have more international guests on board
everything is well organized there is something for all tastes in terms of cuisine if you are traveling with children of kindergarten age this is the right place for you i dont think they will get their moneys worth on shore excursions because the weather was very rainy and stormy the outdoor areas around the ship were also only available to a limited extent the party mood was excellently catered for in many places on the ship the fjords were barely visible because of the time of year and the short daylight hours i would personally do this trip in late spring
route guidance top st class photo studio top breakfast in the buffalo steak house interesting art auctions poor value for money for the excursions room for improvement in terms of accessibility and competence in responses to customer queries especially before departure reliability of billing and information too many people on board too few ergonomic seating options too much queuing
high price poor service food quality has declined significantly compared to family cabin between two smoking cabins so we couldnt use our balcony paid for expensively cabin cleaning was mediocre garbage food scraps from previous guests under the bed concierge hardly approachable as he was never on site and if a reservation request could be made they were told they had to take care of it themselves i dont need the service either offers in the lounge very monotonous the same thing every day
warning very very high risk of infection with gastrointestinal diseases among other things the whole family was sick even though we were extremely careful the vacation was a complete horror for us the hospital on the nova was far too crowded we gave up after two onehour attempts we were really panicking here i would not expose my family with small children to such a risk again the play areas were far too crowded for the very little ones absolutely not recommended dont be as naive as we were and think it through carefully
everything was satisfactory however some excursions were too short
good ship but completely overcrowded the different needs of the guests families with small children seniors couples solo travelers are not really taken into account entertainment is rather below average and sometimes consists only of poorly packaged aftersales advertisingactivities the food and ambience are average at best but this may also be due to the high number of guests
lots of entertainment for children two slides and a childrens park there are activities in which we were not part of them because they do not speak any spanish nor information nor anything in spanish which made our experience not completely perfect
good organization except in the buffet restaurants lots of good food
great service nice staff and very tasty food
i went on the aidasol in and was overwhelmed of course i wanted to share my joy with my husband unfortunately it was just mass processing on the nova long queues for a table and the same food almost every day which is good but variety would have been nice the day of my engagement was really bad that day we drove to rouen and our bus which was supposed to pick us up at pm just didnt come in the end we were picked up by a bus that had broken down and we drove kmh on the motorway which scared me a lot we changed buses but the day was over and last but not least i got a stomach infection on the last day and couldnt enjoy the day anymore and this despite frequent hand disinfection it was supposed to be our last vacation before our daughter is born in august but unfortunately it wasnt it was all stressful and we couldnt enjoy it
after mein schiff cruises we needed something new that would meet our expectations our expectations of entertainment and cuisine were exceeded we would love to come back
zero starsfake friendlinessonly superficially cleanlousy food brown fruit and salad in the buffet several times
metropolises from hamburg and over children on board plus a gastrointestinal virus that was reacted to too late and which made many guests sick
please change the annoying signature system for every water beer or cola to a flat rate without a signature its annoying the waiters spend more time booking than looking after the guests at the bar and thats also very unhygienic
unproblematic arrival and departure delicious food friendly staff
if you like entertainment and parties this is the place for you if you prefer something quieter you should think about it
drinks package pricing policy is not transparent ship is overcrowded usual quotall inclusivequot problems like no free sunbeds by the pool poolwhirlpool full unless you enjoy piling yourself up like sardines in a can runofthemill canteen food instead of local dishes so no real connection to the area you are staying in
the staff on board were very friendly and helpful and i also really enjoyed the evening events
individual something for every taste highly guestoriented quotif someone really wants to find a fly in the ointment they will find onequot we certainly didnt find any in the ointment and definitely want to come back
i liked it on board food and drinks good clean and friendly staff
bad customer service clueless employees and a completely unsmooth process first of all on the first day on board we decided to upgrade the drinks package light to do this we went to reception the ladies there then sent us to deck to the brewery where the employee looked at us very confused and said what would reception have thought of sending you here they must know full well that this is only possible in the wine shop please go there so far so good the booking was successfully made in the wine shop however a lot went wrong in the back office suddenly we only had one of the booked deluxe comfort packages and various credit notes we then received a letter from the back office telling us to go to deck to the stellabar to make the correct booking when we arrived with the letter in hand the bartender said we should go to reception on deck after a lengthy discussion he made a booking which caused even more confusion we then decided to go to reception to hopefully get some help or an explanation for all these bookings but who would have expected it the lady couldnt give us any information either we were promised an appointment to talk but it never took place when we looked at our onboard account the next day everything had been corrected how can it be that the correction can now suddenly be made automatically by the back office without us having to be there why cant you make such important bookings directly at reception because of poor communication here the relaxation had already diminished on the first day furthermore despite the comfort deluxe we often had to check again and again whether the drinks we had ordered had not been charged because the waiters or bartenders often wrote down the wrong drinks or didnt write them down at all how can something like that happen after the trip an additional higher amount was debited which we did not see and do not understand how it came about we are still waiting in vain for an answer by email this cruise was booked mainly because of the highlight island of la gomera this was not visited so we had an extra day at sea we were actually supposed to have reached the island of gran canaria at around pm on the last day before our journey home we werent able to make the most of that day either as we didnt arrive until pm and the excursion we wanted couldnt go ahead so we only had of the full days we had booked we tried to contact customer service after our trip but unfortunately that also seemed to be in vain according to the internet several people only received a reply to their email after several weeks so it seems to be normal for it to take a little longer with aida all in all it wasnt a relaxing holiday as you always had to look for a seat in the buffet restaurant or even search several restaurants to see if there was a free seat at the la carte restaurants it was not unusual to have to wait in a long line for a table
aida crew was extremely friendly helpful and hardworking culinary variety always fresh
friendliness and humanity of the crew and staff
clean ship good entertainment
the staff was super nice in the east waiter xavier lobo was particularly polite he anticipated our every wish the whole staff was super nice im back on the aida because my girlfriends daughter works on the aida mahl natscha
on board the ship the guest comes first
the food on board was as always very tasty and the different restaurants offered a wide variety of dishes unfortunately the trip to burj khalifa in dubai on friday was associated with a lot of traffic jams because of the holiday and we had to queue for minutes from pm for the elevator and only minutes on the observation deck because the trip was only scheduled to last until pm
i am simply an absolute fan of the aida but the aida cosma was just too crowded for me personally it felt like mass processing since i have already traveled on the aida prima for example i have a comparison i felt more comfortable on the prima i personally also noticed differences in quality the selection of food in the restaurants was much more varied on the prima overall i would not travel on the aida cosma again
large ship some busy buffet restaurants great specialty restaurants
we travelled with aida again after years and a lot has changed in the meantime but unfortunately not for the better the quality of the food in the buffet restaurants was average at best and the restaurants were regularly overcrowded one of the planned ports had to be cancelled due to the weather ok it can happen in general but there was no compensation for this which is different from what i know from other tour operators excursions booked for the morning through aida were rescheduled to the middle of the day after booking so that there was no time for a shore excursion either before or after guests have to find out about changes to excursions themselves there is no proactive information from the tour operator which is better from other providers and it doesnt match the prices quoted so as a guest i expect more service the staff were always very friendly and the service really good but i regularly suspected that either they were cutting costs or that there was an unwanted shortage of staff for example in the restaurants and bars overall the priceperformance ratio did not feel anymore appropriate the prices are too high for what is offered
food on the cosma very good entertainment great
the mass of passengers takes some getting used to
arrived on the ship despite the ground staff strike no additional costs for arrival and departure due to the strike were incurred aida everything well organized rooms buffets leisure program very satisfactory behavior of some fellow travelers intolerable drinking bottles of all kinds are put under the sparkling water taps risk of infection inevitable cloakroom for dinner
we have travelled with aida many times on various ships in recent years it has become clear that they are cutting costs the food in the buffet restaurants is often repetitive has become simpler but still tasty the show programme is shorter and worse and prices are higher the fight for sunbeds has become terrible sunbeds are taken in the morning before breakfast and the people who have taken them come by for lunch the crew was always very friendly and nice and the cutlery and table setting was ok again this time the prices of the excursions have also increased significantly i think we will not travel with aida next time
aida has switched to mass processing poor quality of food and hardly any variety in many places there is a lack of quality and good staff aida is not what it used to be events on board have been shortened and always very late welcome party and officer shakeups have been cancelled aida is no longer fun and the relaxation factor has become less smoking on board in many areas is also very disturbing given the prices and poor quality we will think twice about traveling with aida next time
almost everything was perfect except that there were no loungers on sea days
great food beautiful veranda cabin with aboveaverage storage space
the good organization at aida the quality of the food and the service were once again completely satisfactory
the staff is simply great very friendly and helpful the sushi restaurant is particularly recommended
service food was not special
unfortunately its a mass process with no opportunity to relax on board horribly loud in the restaurants masses of people everywhere its very difficult to get a seat and you have to search and wait for a long time
friendly service staff coffee and bar service was ok reception friendly help very good
every night there was cleaning work underneath our balcony cabin and sauna area outside despite informing reception this was not stopped
every year more profit maximization no significant entertainment on board especially on sea days
everything was great on the aida great shows firstclass service great food bars etc the many people are well distributed on the ship
overall the trip was ok no vegan food towels and bed linen were dirty despite being changed several times the return flight was an overpriced disaster with a fine on top of that caused by the aida office all pool loungers were reserved with towels but no one was to be seen using them the farewell evening took place during the trip because some guests left the ship
everything was perfect here from arrival to departure very well organized good entertainment and varied cuisine the shore excursions were possible even without an organized guide the destinations bergen stavanger christianssand and oslo were well chosen a relaxing trip
mediocre cruise with unfriendly bar staff nobody wanted to give any information as there were very few signposts when asked for directions they always just shrugged their shoulders and said they didnt know in the market restaurant which used to always have a country motto they dont serve the same dishes only the side dishes have changed sometimes round fried potatoes sometimes square fried potatoes sometimes fried potato wedges the sauna is expensive and there are fixed times if you book it from home the appointment is cancelled because another one is taking place if you want to rebook there are always some overpriced events taking place in the evenings
first of all for most of those interested i may simply not be part of the target group for aida cruises and may have the wrong expectations i am female years old and have booked a comfort veranda cabin on deck for my mother and me on the south norway route this booking with single occupancy of quotlargequot cabins is only possible by telephone and with the approval of the specialist department i have already been on several cruises in the past but the last time with aida was years ago on a smaller ship in the mediterranean i am not pricesensitive but i am demanding does that make me obviously the opposite of typical aida guests my mistake positive the logistics for checkin and checkout at the cruise terminal steinwerder are absolutely fantastic and very well planned both processes were completed in minutes everything was perfectly planned and organized impressive the service staff in the bars and all restaurants are extremely good the same goes for the cabin service unfortunately far too few german guests give extra tips the quality of the food was above average especially in the la carte rossini restaurant and at breakfast in the steakhouse surprisingly great vegan options cleanliness of the cabins a negative the aida nova is an absolute disgrace especially when fully or almost fully booked especially on routes in cool areas where the outdoor areas are almost unusable even in dry weather there is only sparse seating at the tables outside and no loungers at all the entire crowds of people always and everywhere squeeze into the interior in search of seats food drinks the same crowds of people clog up smaller towns on state holidays the mass of nonschoolage children strollers handcarts buggies amp co caused even more chaos a lack of space and an unbearable background noise everywhere and at all times and with corresponding cabin neighbors there is no peace even at night unfortunately the entertainment in the theatrium in the middle of the ship is almost impossible to escape if you want to sit in the beautiful surrounding bars i prefer closed theaters and open bars with appropriate stylish bar music personally i had the impression that guests who enjoy the evening entertainment like to consume content like jungle camp etc at home
the trip was ok overall the staff on board tried very hard however there was practically no vegan food on offer and we were only able to eat dessert on out of days there is an extra charge for vegan ice cream while milk ice cream is free bed linen and towels were often very dirty and had to be changed several times before you were lucky enough to get clean linen despite generous tips room service became increasingly unmotivated and careless over time as we were on board longer than other guests we were told to leave halfway through the vacation extremely inappropriate we will definitely not book our arrivaldeparture flight with aida again we paid three times the usual market price there despite this only the cheapest of the budget airlines were booked for us as aida reported false names to the airline we also had to pay a fine per person to even be allowed to fly the aida quotemergency numberquot rudely turned us away here after all this exertion you really need a vacation again
relaxed friendly staff food ok but always the same despite the quotthemesquot cabin service from elsass a all the staff positive elvis cathy jerry romi and and and sorry if i cant name them all excursions not booked through aida overpriced entertainment very good conclusion we would travel with aida again
coffee cruise of course every company has to be profitable but finding the same dry meat with some kind of pasta variation on the buffet almost every day quickly becomes annoying it is almost fascinating to watch the bustling hectic crowds running around in front of the buffet alternatives such as best pizza and almhtte were not exactly what you would want in the caribbean at the start of the trip the corridors and rooms were ice cold most of the guests were ill as a result trying to find peace and quiet on the pool deck on sea days was hopeless all the loungers were reserved and an entertainer was constantly yelling into the microphone that the guests should pay for one of the delicious drinks at the specially set up pool bar all that was missing was to advertise the cooking pots and rheumatism blankets then simply stop the ship at sea to save on berthing fees and be surprised that the ship is rocking complaints were arrogantly played down the best dj was dj joy the rest was good for private use excursions through aida are overpriced and not as good as if you organized them yourself and on the day of departure you are dropped off at the airport more than hours before departure never again aida
this was our first cruise we had passengers of them children the staff on the ship were great respect we also had a drinks package which we didnt really need but some people drink their way through the menu run around the ship in terrycloth slippers or bathing sandals and shorts in the evening no sign of hygiene apart from us not many people used the sinks or disinfectant sprays in front of the buffet you should behave on vacation too we have booked again for next year and hope that there will be less going on on the ship because aida and its staff still impressed us ship stars and guests stars
particularly good chefs at bella donna who take care of guests with food intolerances vijai and tobin great enjoyment for us from the beginning to the end of the trip without having to constantly explain what quotworksquot and what unfortunately doesnt thank you mrs kruse at rossini is very attentive here too the cooking is done in such a way that the evening is a wonderful experience great steffen as supervisor and bandu as cabin service the team in the hospital the bike guides sabrina as dance teacher we really should mention everyone by name thank you to the entire crew we really enjoyed the winter break in the caribbean
i find the friendliness of all the staff the cultural offerings and the variety of restaurants very positive
unfortunately my friend was locked in a public toilet for an hour in hospital afterwards people started talking rudely and didnt take it seriously we handed things in two days later a pair of my trousers came back for cleaning but they had ruined it a hole in a new pair of trousers was also reported to reception on the last day we were told to contact rostock they had nothing more to do with it we were charged for drinks that werent consumed and we were charged twice
unfortunately there was no caribbean feeling on the ship in the caribbean i dont need meat loaf and wheat beer on the pool deck on a day at sea and then theres dj finn who would be better off in any mountain hut its sold with the phrase that german vacationers expect it the food wasnt caribbean either
the atmosphere on board is very familiar respectful and relaxed
prices for cruises are getting higher and higher and the quality of the food is getting worse high costs for transfer buses friendly staff in the restaurants very good editor christian ptschke bad annoying entertainment manager benny says little with a lot of words
cleanliness and friendly staff good selection of food and drinks top spa and fitness area
varied food except for the fruit fantastic cleanliness and great staff
as usual with aida once again very satisfied big compliments to the kitchen the food was particularly good this time
entertainment organization restaurants at a high level
great ship friendly service staff confident captain very tasty and rich food selection
easy checkin as a guest you are well looked after very friendly staff perfect cleanliness of the entire ship excellent food in the individual restaurants great entertainment
unfortunately a very negative and unfortunately lasting impression of mass tourism and mass processing you should unfortunately plan and reserve everything well in advance as there is little to no chance of spontaneously taking part in for example spontaneous climbing gardens or seats in specialty restaurants on board bars pools and theatrium are usually too full and good seats are hard to get unless you secure them well before the event starts this is also the case in the buffet and allinclusive restaurants you usually have to go to other restaurants that you didnt really want to go to because there were simply no tables free or you had to queue forever and force the other guests to leave with visible queues by the time you had your food together because it was finally your turn it was already cold at your seat at the bars you also had to wait forever to order something and then eventually get it it might not be so bad in the warmer months as it can be spread out over the outside decks but then in the winter months it would be better to start with fewer guests for the sake of customer satisfaction but not everything was as bad as it might seem great shows good activities a super teens and kids club and lots of other activities like vr mini golf curling etc very good organization for shore excursions and return as well as wellorganized structured customs clearance by britain border control plus the charm that no other vacation offers waking up in your sleep the next morning in another wonderful city and country the london excursion from southampton should be taken out of the program as the effort and experience are completely out of proportion it would be better to travel to london separately for a long weekend
our third cruise and last one with aida the non german staff is amazing but the german staff is really not service minded and feel themselves more as the others have asked them by email and phone to come back to us regarding an excursion we had to cancel due to sickness and after a month of reminders aida didnt bother to answer
where do i start the food in the restaurants is bad since when are melons as hard as apples shows are very boring and not entertaining i ordered a greeting card with an order which was not in the room and was not handed out i ordered a childs birthday party at casanova with a greeting text and label for the cake we got it in the weite welt restaurant and i had to order everything again at reception the shower water hardly came out this is how it was explained to us it is in sections we were on deck aidaprima needs renovation the film on the walls of the elevator is partially torn off excursions are extremely overpriced i got it much cheaper through getyourguide some of the staff are tooooo nice feigned friendliness captains liked to chat make long announcements i thought it was great others found it annoying the sofa bed had urine stains which were not even covered up just disgusting on the first day the coffee cream and sugar were not refilled bath towels were not provided and the balcony was not even cleaned included water not always refilled on the th day when the ship was being cleaned there were marks on the balcony from chemical cleaning products that had not been cleaned at least a call to reception got the water vacuumed up i have never had to call reception as often as on this trip at least the internet worked great steak restaurant is not worth the money at least the patio deck was pleasant aida is becoming a cheap provider with mass tourism without being cheap unless you book an inside cabin in the vario without extras internet etc when i started with aida aida was also quite cheap but not as well known which i liked more im looking around for other providers
we had booked the flights to the caribbean through aida but were later rebooked via london to barbados even though we had booked a direct flight from frankfurt it cost us time nerves and energy as a result we had no seat reservations and as a couple we sat rows apart the veranda cabin on the aidaperla turned out to be a small spartan cabin mouse hole with a canopy on the veranda that blocked our view there was a lot of smoking all around so we could never leave the veranda door open there are many attractive smoking lounges on the ship why do you still have to smoke outside your cabin these days i would have preferred to fly off again where is the dress code in the evening saw lots of men in shorts and flipflops aida was much better including the food conclusion no more aida trips if nothing changes here but my big compliments go to the entire crew on the aidaperla including the tough fantastic captain mr schmid from dresden friendly informative and always in a good mood
it was my first time on a ship so it was important to me to feel comfortable in the cabin we had a special panoramic balcony cabin but it was torture for me to endure the smell for days
basically everything was great except for the unfriendly dj a who preferred to fulfill his own dream at the expense of the guests enjoyment
everything was problemfree checking in in hamburg took about half an hour at lunchtime our suitcases were already in front of our cabin when we got to deck the food was excellent considering that as a pensioner you dont eat that much the excursions we booked were very well organized everything went smoothly including the security check when we got on the ship we want to get from port to port safely special praise goes to the filipinos in the restaurants they looked after our wellbeing and are always friendly and have a great smile we dont accept bad opinions from others we have had our own experiences we will be booking our next route for shortly there were three of us grandma grandpa and grandson years old he was thrilled many thanks to the entire crew
tasty food everything clean quick checkin and checkout good friendly staff
everything is very well organized on the aida there are many different restaurants something for every taste everything is very clean modern and nicely decorated there is a varied entertainment program but unfortunately you cant take part in everything
aida is no longer aida the clientele has changed dramatically and guests cannot expect any class in the restaurants everything that can be reserved free of charge is already booked out before the trip begins guests are no longer allowed to wear evening wear in the past all events on board were so special now guests are more likely to quotdrinkquot the drinks menu unfortunately quantity rather than quality i miss the special aida feeling from previous trips so much the large ships are more like mass tourism ships everything is mercilessly overcrowded the hardworking staff on board are all working idly respect
unfortunately its all about entertaining children the pool is almost unusable for adults its sometimes very loud many come to dinner and to the theater dressed completely inappropriately shorts and there are no free loungers on sea days because everything is always covered with towels for many people the motto here is to eat and drink until you drop we probably wont book another cruise with aida
good allround care always friendly staff good offers on the ship and excursions
friendly punctual good food great shows
it was a perfect trip all the staff were polite and the entire ship was very clean
unfortunately the room was very loud until midnight as if the laundry was above us very negative experience at the muster station which casts a big shadow on safety on board
the staff are welltrained and selected and the ships facilities can be used at any time especially by families with children the food on offer is varied and tasty the cabins are decorated with great attention to detail eg towel design on the beds
too expensive the emphasis is on the quantity of income the sports equipment on an excursion is antediluvian you are treated like an idiot if there are technical problems the list is very long the service staff on the individual decks bars rooms etc are super friendly and helpful nevertheless its over for me
the cabin that was booked eg veranda comfort with extra space was super small like a normal balcony cabin the rd adult only had space in the bunk bed the staff was as always very friendly and always smiling
everything was very well organized super friendly staff buffet restaurants had a very good selection and taste we had one problem with the cabins on deck there was a lot of loud work going on on deck at night it sounded like doors were constantly slamming
good and fast organization friendly staff please ensure that the sunbeds are no longer reserved with towels
mass tourismimpersonalunfriendlymoney machinesometimes unfriendly and tired staffbuffet warunhygienic reception very unfriendly and arrogant excursions were well organized special restaurants were perfect
ship cleanliness in general activities are ok shore excursions are overpriced three or four times as much as with thirdparty providers cabin veranda comfort is not that big for people but only ok for sleeping and showering veranda is ok restaurants bars food is ok staff have big problems with cleanliness and service many refilled bottles some were not allowed to why not it was not explained the rules are not clear theater shows auditorium is very bad you can hardly see anything from many points shows in the evening are ok mornings and afternoons are totally boring for us life on msc for example is much livelier and more colorful deck activity sports mostly ok pool we didnt try it slides were very popular
the service and the ship were top notch very friendly staff the priceperformance ratio was good compliance with hygiene measures could be monitored more closely although this is the guests own responsibility the target audience has now fallen to a lower standard
everything is tailored to the holidaymakers the many different ports the friendliness of the staff it would be desirable if the reception staff or those working in the background could also answer everything and speak to the passengers personally if something is not clear
too many people frustration in front of and in the elevator overcrowded restaurants strange smell in the bathroom very friendly staff except in the fitness area great stage shows the captain is very friendly and intelligent the cities visited are fantastic
we were on the nova metropole tour this february the food and entertainment was excellent the service and staff were simply great the prices of the excursions and the sometimes overcrowded shiprestaurant andor the theater were a bit of a negative but overall it was a very nice vacation there were four of us in a balcony cabin
the priceperformance ratio when booking a suite is poor there is significant room for improvement here
the club levels list advantages that you dont get because of a lack of staff to work in bars like mc you pay a lot more for that staff should speak to people in the restaurant when they go out to eat in shorts staff should also take the rescue drill seriously and not just swipe their card at the assembly point
not everything worked well too big too crowded too complicated but overall it was good
the staff were in a good mood delicious culinary delights and a relaxed outdoornudist area matched the great weather
the booking service is incredibly unfriendly pride comes before a fall
far too many eastern europeans on board where will this lead they also behaved cheekily when they appeared in packs
everything was fine for me a cruise is not
the crew did an excellent job everything was clean some areas were offered for an additional charge i didnt like that
organization inadequate
very good staff positive the large drinks package very bad negative
politeness friendliness courteous pleasant atmosphere fun sociability laughing questions answered in a friendly manner theater really great food outstanding
i was already very annoyed before the trip we are a family of we booked rooms vario i would never have feared that a travel group on a ship would be booked so far apart as happened to us now one room at the front one at the back one on deck one on deck thats what i call familyfriendly at its finest when you ask you are told that the rooms are allocated by a computer and theres nothing you can do about it of course you get assigned a room with vario booking but you cant place travel groups so far apart
very good food there is really a lot of variety on offer the bars were all very well equipped the evening program had something for everyone
great atmosphere on the aida nova good food very friendly crew
unfortunately the service and quality of aida is getting worse and worse while prices are constantly rising there was no water available in the cabins several times in weeks a nogo in warm countries in the buffet restaurants you could only eat what wasnt already empty and it stayed that way for over minutes before it was refilled new fast internet is all well and good if the wifi doesnt cause problems in our cabin the wifi jumped back and forth from one router to the other we travel a lot so we can compare it well with previous trips
the restaurants and food were great the excursions are poorly supervised and handed over to local organizations nothing is done about reserving sunbeds there is no dress code for dinner and it is not enforced the aidadiva is very worn in the pool and outside area
different countries different dishes it would be nice to be offered dishes that are typical of the country there are enough beef roulades and currywurst at home control those who occupy sunbeds with towels and are not on site other ships control this and prohibit it
great routing in the caribbean with central america arrival with aida flight via frankfurt and db ticket from basel unfortunately no reasonable flight connection from switzerland on offer laying times very good we like the size of aidaluna its tip top the condition of the ship is unfortunately a bit worn and could be better maintained cabins on deck are extremely noisy the quality of the food in the buffet restaurants is good but the dishes are repeated several times during the trip sometimes a scramble at the buffets the behavior of the guests seems to be deteriorating shorts at dinner were not an exception people hardly say hello eg in the elevator everyone only looks out for themselves the german staff on the ship in particular were mostly unfriendly and unhelpful in complete contrast to this were the mostly asian employees who were friendly and helpful and usually had a smile on their faces we really liked the entertainment on offer aidas excursions are overpriced much cheaper from local providers and often available in smaller groups but you have to speak english
everything was ok with german punctuality and cleanliness great food staff great excursions and pictures relaxed and protected quotgetting aroundquot on many islands
very good organization food and drink selection excellent cabin facilities
buffet restaurants much too poor quality casa nova restaurant too poor quality cabin banquet door broken was not repaired
the quality of the food the cleanliness and the friendliness
lack of staff in the restaurants where is the warmth tables are often not clean the entertainment left a lot to be desired this time some were too boring the pool toilets should be checked more often i think hygiene is very important to you the cheese buffet is very small etc
staff friendly and fast food very good ship very nice
food is first class better than some restaurants in the country lots of activities if you want and youre not always in the same place
top service beautiful ship beautiful route staff competent fast and very friendly food in the service restaurants very good and relaxed
unfortunately the quality of the food varies greatly from excellent to mediocre reservations of loungers on open decks should be prohibited
long wait at checkin room was not clean when we arrived the ashtray was still full from the previous guest and there were glass marks on the bedside tables long wait at the bars ship too full food was good aida nova
it was our first cruise and it exceeded everything we imagined service cleanliness food simply fantastic
great overall experience we ate very well enjoyed fantastic entertainment and relaxed well the service staff in the restaurants could be more attentive when new guests sit down at vacant tables
the ambience the food the organization were highly recommended the service was great we had an allround wonderful vacation
maybe more variety in the restaurants there used to be more variety
on a cruise ship everything is under one roof discovering new things relaxing on the veranda activities entertainment very good food the onboard language is german but when there are children on board thats quite a number
i rarely write reviews but on our last trip with the aida nova to southern norway there were a few things that i just had to get off my chest first of all there were problems when checking in because the woman had some kind of problem with my partners id which she didnt want to share with us but only with her colleague later we found out why she had simply mixed up her first and last name as a result we couldnt get into our cabin and couldnt be found during the security drill next i think hygiene is very important but you can disinfect your hands to death and if i just walk past the restaurant you dont have to run after them to disinfect i could just as well be allergic to the product but some of the staff didnt let themselves be dissuaded even after repeated attempts to fend them off i will never really understand aidas drinks system they couldnt simplify it this is also why the cocktails sometimes contain so much ice and are sometimes rather poorly made ok for everyone with allinclusive but annoying for those paying for themselves and why arent the zwickl in the brewery included in the allinclusive package doesnt make sense to me i found the cancellation of the excursion very annoying ok it was pretty cold the route too dangerous i can understand that but if i only find out after ive disembarked at am that the excursion isnt going ahead thats annoying at least there was a small compensation in the form of a hour sauna voucher which brings us to the sauna the area is great the staff are super nice and edgar in particular makes a mega infusion but why do the children have to jump around in the sauna too there really are enough activities on board for them you have to have some peace and quiet somewhere what i also cant understand is the thing with the hairdryer i think its ok that its firmly in the drawer but the cord doesnt reach to the bathroom and theres no mirror nearby how am i supposed to do my hair the food was as always topnotch it was particularly good at casa nova where our waitress was super nice and made a great cocktail and of course the show and the food at time machine were excellent but i had a question about the buffet restaurant there were so many things that were glutenfree and lactosefree which i think is great as it was signposted but why no lactosefree yoghurt and glutenfree bread otherwise we had a lot of fun at the evening shows the performers were great it was a lot of fun in the brewery a big thank you to laura who always created a great atmosphere and a big compliment to the team of photographers the portrait photo shoots were always a lot of fun and the results are great
we boarded as a family and all of the staff were super friendly both to us adults and to the children
the first and last time with aida before the holiday even started the stress started because it was not possible to book additional luggage golf luggage through aida why offer golf trips if you cant take your golf luggage with you and therefore book a larger cabin thank god the service at emirates was great and solved the problem in the best interests of the customer and confirmed that aidas business practices are quotrespectedquot there too and then you come on board on the first day and want to find out more information about the prebooked golf trips and are rather arrogantly and conceitedly put off by the aida staff until the next day until then on the second to last day the trips are cancelled without giving any reason and without an apology on the contrary you are told that you can take care of it yourself then you go to an la carte restaurant in the evening and are not served for over minutes and on valentines day you book a table at the buffalo steakhouse and are rewarded with the worst service again you wait minutes before you are finally served unfortunately complaints are not taken into account the one star goes to the staff in the buffet restaurants and bars they were great and accommodating but that was about it for the positive experiences i can only recommend visiting dubai abu dhabi and bahrain but not via aida
first cruise and it was gigantic
my trip to asia from january th january nd was an absolute disaster in terms of food and culinary delights unfortunately the service staff was not what i am used to some of the wellness areas were very dirty the staff seemed to be understaffed aida stars also only had shows overall the entire management seemed overwhelmed this time only or mostly ballermann music aida can do all of that better on january th a new hotel manager came on board unfortunately too late for us an improvement was in sight for the last days
a cabin of sqm can be offered as a single cabin but not for adults if you subtract the bathroom area bed cupboards etc from the cabin size you are left with about sqm to move around that is a clear nogo
cruise orient sir bani yas advertised as the caribbean but more of a mallorca feel the food selection is significantly worse than on a caribbean cruise on the sister ship not enough staff but that means that fewer drinks have to be served i as well as fellow travelers have the feeling that they are cutting costs and the seat fees are a disgrace when you consider that the airline would generally charge them for free on standard seats
very nice cruise delicious food only the excursions are too expensive and poorly planned
super organized arrival and departure delicious food animation team always in a good mood great entertainment options
everything was well organized all the staff were extremely friendly the food and cleanliness in all areas was very good
everything was great except for the smokers on the balcony of the adjacent cabins and the overpriced arrival package
very good information excellent food too full of families and children during the holiday season you have to walk around a lot to find a place
food was below average tough meat cheap ice cream disaster
it bothered us that the quotmenquot were allowed into the restaurants in the evening wearing shorts even though they were asked to wear long trousers the standard is sinking this was our th aida trip and the last one
nice staff great offers delicious food
unfortunately we didnt like much about this trip the food was rather bad for a cruise shows in weeks also a bit few guest artists were not exciting we are used to all this much better on an aida ship
the arrival and departure were well organized the cabins on the diva are very small and the overall impression of the ship was disappointing you cant call this little thing a pool
evenings without white table wine the white wine available from the menu had to be paid for by the guest here the guest is asked to pay for the unacceptable logistics at breakfast on deck the remaining coffee from the pot was poured together and reheated simply disgusting the coffee tasted like that too there are photos of this aida has deteriorated considerably the tour however had great destinations
before the trip i booked a vital medication for cooling at the hospital when i knocked on the hospital door at on the day of departure a very important employee with glasses and a small pigs head told me that the hospital had closed at go to reception its a good thing our suite had a refrigerator i still cant understand it to this day
always wanted to travel with a kindergarten to experience hours of screaming screeching stomping and hitting out on the plane is pure joy it continues like that on the ship the staff are all very friendly there is nothing to complain about the food because of the sometimes strong air conditioning many people have colds people even cough in the buffet speaking of manners for many passengers this has gone overboard
the ship was clean very nice service not stressful very good food lots of opportunities to spend your free time the theater had various interesting performances opportunity to spend free time for the younger and older generations we recommend it to our friends colleagues from work and family as a nice vacation
we really liked the outdoor terrace at the alle welt restaurant we ate almost all of our meals there and were extremely satisfied with the service staff
it was good as always great service good food great shows great cabin it was our rd trip but not the last
it was a super unforgettable time with lots of good restaurants and sensational shows the cosma is a huge ship with long distances and lots of people but you could always find a place even for four people unfortunately the elevators were usually a bit overcrowded the wellness suite can be recommended our balcony cabin was just great i would love to come back
re xtrip caribbean feb there is nothing to complain about with aidas organization on either the outward or return journey however you should be aware that you are traveling for days with a kindergarten yelling screaming stomping etc as they are quotbrought upquot today is present around the clock it is normal for the little ones like the big ones to catch colds from the climate but it is not nice that they then sneeze and cough into the buffet unfortunately the majority of passengers do not take their manners with them on board in the days i have rarely noticed so many people with no manners i saw everything on the islands that i wanted to see again i stayed away from the hotspots and thank aida for their smooth operation however new customers with a vario tariff should pay attention to the choice of cabin should aida attach importance to another booking
great organization a motivated crew delicious food and appealing entertainment
the service and quality are getting worse every year now more and more eastern european guests are arriving
it was a perfectly organized trip by aida professional evening shows only the food could have been more varied
aida is worth a trip i would like the childcare to be more individual without an extra charge in the cabin for it is very tight with people i would do without the large picture for a few more hooks its a shame that you have to leave the market restaurant every now and then the food on offer leaves nothing to be desired and the table wines were delicious too
very full ship but because we had booked a junior suite we were able to use the lounge area that was very relaxing the buffet restaurants were of course very full which meant that the service staff were sometimes pushed to their limits we preferred the a la carte restaurants but you have to make a reservation in advance because we had the junior suite we were able to have breakfast with waiter service in the beach house that was very quiet and relaxing the cosma is a great ship with a huge variety of cuisine and lots to explore and relax in the service staff in the restaurants and cabins were very friendly as always
unfortunately the service has deteriorated some tables are not cleared or cleaned refilling cutlery napkins cups and glasses is also a stroke of luck the cleanliness of the cabin has also deteriorated bed linen towels and dust etc if youre lucky its clean we can only report on our cabin we are really disappointed this time
worst mass processing stressed employees no more aida feeling what a pity
unfortunately traveling in assembly line mode mass processing in an overwhelmed infrastructure be it restaurants pools or bars that actually has nothing to do with relaxation anymore
it was very nice food was good rooms were good
rather disappointing as an overall experience the balcony cabin was ok but unfortunately balconies are usually flooded and have no drainage otherwise some services are difficult or impossible to get because there is not enough capacity and there are no free tables or seats water for the room costs per bottle despite the drinks package little to no suitable offer for young people joint family sport impossible activities separated by age groups things that are advertised are not as shown sports field mostly closed very small games room for kidsfamilies it only has unattractive paid machines no air hockey or pinball either the pools are also very small and do not correspond to the number of passengers or families food the food is similar or the same almost every day at all buffets often too salty often overcooked whether italian or asian buffet the local cuisine is not prepared properly incidentally there is no freshly squeezed orange juice the ice cream for children at the buffet is never cold enough always melting lots of stress factors restaurants also serve as passageways there are often not enough free seats especially difficult for families at meal times cafs are often closed there is not even a paid pastry shop or chocolate shop where you can go in the afternoon organization unfortunately endless queues at reception and on some shore excursions the restaurants that are paid have to be reserved in advance and are actually always fully booked so you cant go at all entertainment shows are in the middle of the evening in the lobby theatrium or in the swimming pool area without their own theater room special diet food if you want vegetarian halal or are allergic it will be difficult vegan restaurant is an extra charge service and crew employees are from lowwage countries outside of europe and it is noticeable that they work extremely long shifts overall not recommended as an overall experience if you just want to go on a cruise to get to different places go to the gym a bit and eat something it is of course ok overall however it is not as it is presented and advertised because you cannot actually get all of the services even for an extra fee or the quality of the available options is simply not that good
although there were many guests on board everyone felt personally addressed despite crew absences due to illness everyone made an effort to ensure the wellbeing of the guests there were wonderful shows live performances etc great music management arrival and departure including the flight went very well i would recommend it a visit to the wellness suite is also worthwhile and a massage on board does you good
great holiday unfortunately the drinks order takes too long
the organization of the spa area especially the sauna needs to be optimized
in comparison to competitors such as tui mein schiff far too full and quality inadequate some very unfriendly staff cabins too narrow cabins not cleaned satisfactorily dirt from previous travelers aida childfriendly no unfortunately not eg musicsound always far too loud and very harmful for children even adults food quality not good but important too little choice and no flexibility when making requests no fresh vegetables potatoes dry and hard etc restaurant reservations chaotic and inflexible waiting times for drinks far too long quality of drinks not sufficient pools too small and not sufficient
first of all our first vacation in our lives was not allowed to take place because aida would not let my daughter dre on board apparently a stamp was missing in her passport then her pregnancy was apparently too far along strange because on the ship i found another woman at the same or even later time coffee was just disgusting not drinkable so you have to buy one from the machine if you want white wine and red wine are terrible disgusting you are forced to buy something despite having a lot of money service and staff great there is always one or the other who is not interested or in the mood food fabulous
aida you think of modern ships great dining experiences shows and wonderful destinations with huge positive memories we are a group of people with plenty of experience from sea travel on mein schiff royal caribbean etc last year we decided to go on an extraordinary trip days from nearby seychelles via mauritius madagascar and reunion several days at sea are on top of that we are without sounding arrogant here suite guests as we were on other ships what is important to us in our bookings so far is a large cabin a large balcony with a view of the stern or the bow exceptional service as well as the ability to eat in one of the restaurants hours a day or have drinks in the room the politeness and motivation of the crew members are a big part of the feelgood factor on board now to the experiences of our aida trip we noticed straight away that the surcharge for a suite is not noticeable before entering the suite you dance in the same row as all the guests you dont get a separate pass there is no suite reception and a captain doesnt come to see you at the beginning during or after the trip our suite is of course clean but sometimes the coffee is missing or the milk is missing it is forgivable if aida doesnt provide further features there is no side area here the restaurants are quotclosedquot for suite guests and all other guests at the same time i mention closed because the opening times are really embarrassing for such a large small ship breakfast until am sometimes only until on excursion days there are no alternatives unless you can get a drinks package then you wont die of thirst until the restaurants open again at pm otherwise there is hanuta and gummy bears on deck for a few euros as lunchtime snacks if a guest has the nerve to enter the breakfast restaurant at am they are immediately and rudely informed at the entrance that they have to leave the restaurant in minutes this is a great way to start the day the usual friendly service and if required a good glass of champagne are missing at every corner special requests are not accepted or are not welcome and there is certainly no late checkout at am you are swept out of your cabin and then left to stretch your legs on the ship until the transfer at pm our conclusion about aida if you are used to suites and the complete service that goes with them from other providers then stay away from aida there is not even a price advantage here that justifies the gradations this was our last trip with aida for a balcony cabin with the usual standards you can probably use aida but you have to like the mass tourism that aida celebrates addendum it is pm and there is nothing left to eat on the aida blu all restaurants are closed oton i also advise guests in the balcony cabins not to travel on the aida fleet unless you combine the cruise with a diet ahoy
the excursions should be conducted in german as stated in the offer and more emphasis should be placed on better quality help with putting on life jackets was rudely refused dining room always overcrowded turned away times pool deck always overcrowded not enough loungers reception always difficult to reach food was always well seasoned and excellent show program fantastic and very very good
this cosma cruise was probably the low point of all the cruises we have taken with aida we have been on aida around times it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to find another reason to go on a cruise with aida this time we had booked several cabins again to take our children and grandchildren with us and spend a few nice days in the canary islands lets start with the tui fly flight if aida is going to charter this cheap airline then please at least include a drink and a small snack that should really be included at these prices especially since the food offered in the quotonboard cafequot flyer is not available on the flights the balcony cabin that was assigned to us was a disaster it was dirty when we arrived and after we had informed reception it was not cleaned properly we then cleaned it ourselves that was definitely not what was intended we wanted to use the hammock on the mini balcony on the first day at sea lo and behold the previously missing wool blankets were in a very dirty condition in the hammock simply disgusting this was also reported to reception and the blankets were then replaced in the early evening the second booked balcony cabin was immediately cleaned by our son and his daughters after arrival hair fluff dust bunnies etc had to be removed the third booked balcony cabin was unfortunately even dirtier when it was handed over to our second son and his family not only hair in the shower but old stains from glasses cocktail glasses drinks bottles etc all over the furniture were reported to reception an old sock from a previous traveler in the cabin was also found and this also had to be cleaned a second time how dirty the cabin was and how inadequately it had been cleaned became apparent during the trip when the boarding pass of a traveler who had previously been accommodated in the cabin e burg was found we saved ourselves another trip to reception as there were endless queues the ship and its crew were completely overwhelmed by the number of passengers we were rarely able to quotconquerquot a table together in the buffet restaurants if we hadnt booked in advance in the restaurants where drinks have to be paid for then there was never a chance of being able to sit together in the evening due to the overcrowding of the ship the staff in the buffet restaurants were neither able to clean the tables reasonably quickly nor even offer table wine we were even sent away outside the restaurants because all the tables were supposedly occupied but the other restaurants were also full the dishes on offer were also repeated almost daily and the fact that many dishes disappeared from the buffet faster than you could blink and were only slowly replenished is probably also due to the overwork of many aida employees the fact that some fellow travelers were not prevented from taking entire juice bottles from the counter is a real nuisance for everyone else the fact that the staff did not pay attention to decent clothing shorts at dinner and many fellow travelers hardly used the disinfection stands some fellow travelers even successfully pushed past the employees posted here and there is just an expression of the negligence that can now be seen everywhere at aida the bars were also a complete disappointment waiting times of minutes for drinks are now the new normal on aida of course we were never able to get loungers on any of the decks and aida employees also did not release loungers that were occupied but had remained unused for hours although quotvery rarelyquot one of the employees put themselves in danger of being spoken to the fact that there were no pool towels left several times in the afternoon was the lesser evil aidas answer quotthe deficiencies you have mentioned for which we understand very well are all personal inconveniences according to current case law none of the points mentioned are a travel defect for which financial compensation must be paidquot
super logistics professional shows excellent food and selection
in summary we were always happy when we could leave the hospital ship the guests consisted mainly of people with respiratory problems and alcoholics
everything is well organized everyone is friendly and helpful and everyone does their best to make sure everything runs smoothly the atmosphere is great the food selection is amazing there is something for every taste
mass tourism no appreciation for the customer
super organized from the flight to checking in and out
we were on the aidanova from january th the ship has great facilities water slides whirlpools large childrens area with pools slides etc the staff was friendly and accommodating the cabin was cleaned daily as were towels if requested there are quottopquot service restaurants food including drinks for an additional charge and there are also selfservice restaurants with opening times the ship was definitely too full from pm onwards there was a battle at the buffet there was also a fight for every free quotseatquot in the selfservice restaurant because according to information at the reception there were almost children on board the noise at the indoor pool was accordingly high the whirlpools were occupied by small children in diapers i have never seen this with any other shipping company the whirlpools and the relatively small indoor pool approx sqm were more of a learning pool for babies and toddlers despite the extremely large quot elementsquot childrens area on the same deck with a climbing park slides baby pool pool etc
the pool area is not big enough for the number of people on the ship its far too cold with the degrees in the hot tub far below youd freeze in there
the staff lives the slogan that smiles are on board the ship
hello i would like to give an objective review of my caribbean trip on the aida luna there are many good things to report but also some not so good things as far as the staff are concerned almost all of them are very friendly and accommodating but this is mostly due to the mentality of the countries of origin the food in the various restaurants is also ok although the buffalo steakhouse deserves special mention the bars on board are well equipped although the daily cocktails only differ in color not in taste and some bartenders mix things together and do so very differently for the same cocktails i would no longer book the excursions through aida far too expensive too many people and some of them in english on a completely german ship its very strange the ship itself is no longer the newest but still usable if you look closely you can see a lot of rust in the edges and corners which can still be concealed with a very thick layer of paint the fellow travelers mostly germans here the slogan quoteasygoing and casualquot is true anyone who can read and write can board aida although reading may still be a problem for some germans if im sitting at dinner in flipflops and shorts but anyone who knows germans knows that they are considered lets say special around the world and like everywhere germans are reserving sunbeds is a big problem the shipping company or the captain should make a daily announcement that towels where no one is lying down will be removed by the crew by a certain time as far as the parties on the ship are concerned ive often heard the term quotmallorca steamerquot and thats partly true if you look at the average age more consideration should be given to many older passengers and the music volume on the pool deck should be turned down a bit because you cant find any peace in your cabin before midnight if you want to sleep you cant even sleep with earplugs what i didnt like at all was the quotvery loud cabin on deck quot and that can really ruin your whole stay on board i originally had a different cabin but wanted a different one since it was near the elevators and asked for a quiet cabin i was then suggested cabin further back as it was the quieter one but apparently the person who assigns cabins has no idea about the ship or aida doesnt care what its customers want this cabin is right underneath the market restaurant and there is no peace and quiet until around pm there is constant and extremely loud moving back and forth in the cabin you can hear every word the snoring of everyone in the neighboring cabin the balcony is also equipped with iron loungers and a very light metal table where you can hear the moving back and forth on the iron floor cabins away and then we are back to the inconsiderate people who do what they want and make noise all night long here too announcements should be made to remind people to keep quiet at night and be considerate conclusion the countries and people that my wife and i saw were beautiful as was the ship the trip on the sea etc but not being able to relax because of the noisy cabin left a bitter aftertaste now a few words about the internet we had the premium version for two devices but without constant help at reception we would not have had internet you had to log in again and again and this whole process is far too complicated even those at reception were sometimes overwhelmed but they knew about all the rubbish with the new skylink system it should be simplified immediately because for euros it should work more easily ps i realize that the shipping company probably doesnt care about my letter but people are looking for peace and quality on vacation in the future and the first person to recognize this will do the business in the future if cruises continue to exist for much longer best wishes roswitha and leopold reimer
if the company sells excursions you must also take into account the quality
we felt very comfortable on the aidablu the furnishings are a bit old but everything is well maintained and in tiptop condition the staff were very friendly and accommodating we had a balcony cabin and were therefore not dependent on the sometimes completely overcrowded sun deck with reserved loungers typically german and rarely used it the food was great and left nothing to be desired the entertainment was very nice and varied with great artists
too many people and too few staff long waiting times at the drinks countersbars reception and at the selfservice coffee machinesbreakfast despite the premium deluxe drinks package we had to pay for mineral water in the room and ice cream at the ice cream bar we had the impression that we had ended up at an advertising and sales event the internet package we booked was an absolute disgrace sauna access only possible with a reservation food cleanliness service staff entertainment ship everything was top notch once and never again
as always everything was ok lots of riders only the ebike excursion left something to be desired
very nice cruise small additions would be desirable but would still go again
we had a lovely time on the ship in beautiful weather lots of people and sometimes a crowd at the buffet but everyone still got plenty the ports on the canary islands were very nice including the excursions
concerns aida diva caribbean trip from january th to january th light and shadow very friendly and courteous service and cleaning staff the quothigher ranksquot could learn a thing or two from that food and selection good to satisfactory but this is not the fault of the chefs but probably the available budget this is probably intended to lure guests into the paid restaurants all in all there were many things that didnt really work out for example the pickup on the day of departure was way too early waiting for almost hours before departure is very exhausting overpriced excursions generally no special feeling when leaving port overpriced drinks aida excursionists were given priority when tendering and the regulars had to wait in the crowded corridor for about an hour and a half too many unfriendly employees among the quotwhitecollar workersquot etc despite all this i would like to point out the special friendliness and competence of the mostly nongermanspeaking staff thank you very much for that they made it possible for us to have a great time
the spa area was never overcrowded there were always appointments available for massages the staff were really friendly and helpful the bartenders whether at the pool or at the trium always had a joke or time for cocktail tricks
great value for money nice staff good restaurants
the crew in the restaurants were very absent sometimes unfriendly the employees were not very motivated only stuart who cleaned our cabin was extremely friendly
this was not our first cruise but the first trip with aida we went to denmark and norway there are a lot of families with children on board and there is entertainment for the children unfortunately there are no family childrens corners in the restaurants the children hardly reach the buffet but are often not accompanied there by their parents couples traveling alone are also on vacation and want some peace and quiet the same applies to the specialty restaurants the pool areas are apparently only intended for families so they are very loud perhaps there should be areas just for adults then everyone will be helped otherwise the aida nova is very large with over passengers everything is very chic modern and clean the balcony cabins with a sofa are spacious enough the inside cabins without a sofa are quite cramped the staff are very friendly and accommodating cleaning is done around the clock the organization from booking to the trip worked perfectly
this is the third time we have travelled with aida the last time with aida cosma we had negative experiences in the following areas servicefriendliness we are travelling with a yearold child our cabin did not have an additional sofa bed but a pullman bed which was above the parents bed and made sleeping under it very oppressive this pullman bed is approved for children aged and over as we were assured when booking that children of that age would get an extra bed we complained about this at reception the staff member took our case with little interest we were also kindly informed that adults can also sleep in the pullman bed she then seemed to mean that we as parents should sleep separately thank you very much for this great suggestion but she then passed on our complaint after hours we were informed that we could have an upgrade for we politely declined the little one then slept quotillegallyquot in the pullman bed restaurantsfood unfortunately we were only able to use the buffet restaurants as everything else was booked out weeks in advance the buffet restaurants had the same food almost every day the same soups the same salads the meat was overcooked and the sauces that went with it were not very tasty after we all caught a nice stomachintestinal virus the smell of the food was not even bearable wellnessspa here too we miss friendly staff you feel like youre a nuisance when you ask three questions to have the conceptprices explained to you childcare here too the friendliness left a lot to be desired to personally welcome a child and accompany them to the playroom was probably too much to expect in our opinion this was the last trip with aida for now the whole concept of concentrating masses in a small space no longer appeals to us
everything looks good on the outside and nothing on the inside lots of advertising promises and then a disappointing performance in practice we were not at all satisfied with the organization the information policy and the service in the restaurants above all the staff lack training but above all the management the price is far too high if you dont get that holiday feeling
in the buffet restaurant special attention was given to requests for light meals i thought that was great
customer service is lacking in the basic attitude of all employees at all levels advertising promises good quality services which are then far from being delivered because cuts are made everywhere especially in employee training we had an interesting route and as a group of we still had a lot of fun even though we expected a lot more from the ship all in all a disappointment
its like coming home we feel good the only problem is that the restaurants are always very busy and you dont always get a free table straight away this problem could be solved by extending opening hours
never again aida nova the ship was completely overcrowded and it felt like a cheap trip too few staff and everyone was overwhelmed by the number of passengers on top of that i got food poisoning we have traveled with aida many times but this will be our last trip for the time being we would rather go on smaller ships with a reasonable quality
good food friendly staff varied program
unclean friendliness and service was not satisfactory food in the buffet restaurant was always the same sometimes it took forever to be served some of the guests acted like animals had nothing to do with a highquality cruise it was our first cruise and probably the last you dont need that
the quality of the food has declined the same dishes reheated every day overcrowded restaurants and bars with long waiting times not all ports were visited
unfortunately the last trip with aidanova was a complete disappointment the ship was completely overcrowded the pool areas including the childrens paddling area were practically unusable due to overcrowding the baby monitor that we had booked and paid for had to be replaced several times before it worked the costs incurred were reimbursed as a quotgoodwill gesturequot the receptionist was not very interested in resolving the problem and reacted very condescendingly overall there is obviously a lot on offer for small children which turns out to be more show than substance when we get there the service at the bars was very poor however there was also a shortage of staff sometimes it took minutes to order and then another minutes to get the drink including unfriendly staff the food was always good on the last day however my daughter and i got food poisoning to top it all off definitely our last trip with aida
it was a lovely cruise and we are already planning the next one the only thing we didnt like was that the food was often cold or lukewarm
the friendliness of the staff and especially the cleanliness on the ship
the service in the specialty restaurants and the food were very good buffets quality deteriorated compared to our last trip on the aidaperla too lax control of hygiene and clothing of guests public toilets partially dirty
onboard credit from a promotion was suddenly not recognized friends who traveled with us received it however it feels as if the waiters are being instructed to serve the drinks slowly information was only given very sporadically the food was very good however
there are still the same problems as in previous years bad customer service almost never reachable and then customerunfriendly german staff very arrogant excursions still a disaster and overpriced when the ships are full you can hardly get anything to drink or a seat in the restaurants
aidablu we have often travelled with aida unfortunately this time we came back disappointed many guests shared our opinion unmotivated staff sometimes unfriendly no dress code at dinner no atmosphere especially on sea days the aidablu is a relatively quotsmallquot ship unfortunately there were far too few shady spots as i have back problems i asked for a mattress topper at reception it was only the next day after i asked again that one was provided to me for a fee that was not refunded no hotel has ever charged a fee for this apparently aida needs to collect the money
a certain dress code is not observed too many children on board so there was no peace anywhere no information from management that the internet was not working or that the data volume had been used up which then had to be booked at great expense the food and drinks were always very good the service staff were very attentive very clean everywhere
the ship aida cosma is huge and very spacious but nothing more but aida should rethink its concept there are numerous shipping companies that are already making things more pleasant for holidaymakers when i pay and then get a cocktail made from a machine regardless of whether its with or without alcohol im scratching my head and the staff are totally unfriendly we sometimes had to wait up to minutes for drinks on top of that youre stared at and then someone else standing next to you is grabbed and youre forced to only drink during meal times its cheeky for example my wife had a migraine attack and i just wanted to fill a glass or her bottle with water and then i was harassed that was only when i was eating so please on mein schiff there are free water dispensers everywhere on board for things like drinking and not just when you go out to eat espresso machines are only free on mein schiff for an extra charge in the cabin trips with shuttle buses are free and not euros to get into town etc drinks with or without alcohol are included with mein schiff and you dont have to pay euros for days just because you want a cocktail food only at set times i want to eat when i want and what i want on vacation perfect with mein schiff so only mein schiff in future
any time again but no longer the canary islands
the trip was great and interesting but the food in some restaurants was simply catastrophic and too little entertainment on sea days the holiday was
the ship the route and the ports were very good there was almost nothing to complain about with the food the friendliness at the bars and reception could have been better unfortunately the excursions we booked were only partly good sometimes we felt like we were being driven this is not acceptable especially with older participants
the food was bad and they reprocessed food from the day before the food was almost the same everywhere the restaurants were fully booked there were hardly any seats in the restaurant the food in the time machine was terrible the jacuzzis were also cold even in the spa which i found unbelievable and you have to pay for it the shows are cheap some not all waiters are arrogant and unfriendly long waits at the bars for drinks not enough good entertainment on offer the wifi doesnt work properly despite paying the spa and excursion offers are overpriced
the extremely friendly staff and the selectionquality of the food unfortunately due to the high number of children and teenagers this could not be enjoyed in any of the buffet restaurants
the food was no longer as good there was a lack of staff
service organization staff and itinerary were perfect
we saw a lot in a short time ship with attention to detail the guest is the priority anyone who complains here should stay at home the only drawback is that the balcony room is unfortunately overpriced
we could choose from a lot of different meat and vegetables
unfortunately we cannot recommend the aidanova for a family of five the service staff were mostly neutral or annoyed by the guests on board you had the feeling of being a supplicant rather than a welcome guest we have had much better experiences on smaller ships otherwise the food was good but the restaurants were much too full the cabins were fine the cabin staff were friendly for a vacation we were annoyed too often by things that shouldnt have happened
wellorganized cruise with a few notable flaws if you want to enjoy peace and quiet on a cruise this is not the place for you small children and their noise levels are present in all areas if you like that you are in good hands here for everyone else i recommend a different ship
well organized trip nice crew they cant do anything for the guests
unfortunately almost every bar on the ship only has a small mini menu of the actually very large bar menu so we always had to take our cell phone with us which had a screenshot of the entire bar menu why is there only this small menu everywhere shouldnt we drink so much at the large pool bar we once stood for minutes waiting for our order because it was too full you dont want to spend your vacation like that but it wasnt the staffs fault they really tried very hard the food was always tasty but unfortunately there was very little variety after weeks we really couldnt stand the restaurants anymore the rolls at breakfast were a disgrace dry and basically just air in them i only ever ate croissants because the rolls put me in a bad mood
combination of hotel culinary experience entertainment city trips and perfection in process and organization
what a hustle and bustle they push passengers and crew onto a ship and then they set sail chaos in the restaurants because everyone has to eat too everything in german and its racing against the clock because you are only in a port for a limited time each time the canary islands cruise is nothing at all the ports you enter or the bus tours offered are all the same
on deck the ship noises were unbearably loud well remedied
st cruise very skeptical at the beginning a in my summary complete organization service in all areas cleanliness in all areas cabin equipment general offers food i wont book any more excursions
the reservations of the deckchairs would have to be changed
aida prima too crowded not enough seats in the buffet areas constantly searching for free seats too few loungers or too many people reserving loungers and aida does nothing about it clearly too few seats in the atrium so you cant watch the shows balcony cabins on deck are incorrectly displayed instead of sliding doors there are doors that always slam shut loudly it is not possible to leave them open the same food in the buffet areas for at least days excursions in the shopping cart were booked by aida without asking reception with too little knowledge florian and sometimes florian very arrogant too many areas only accessible to suite guests the next cruise will definitely not be with aida
aidanova was incredibly crowded and in my opinion overcrowded for the outdoor areaspublicly accessible areas unfortunately the food in all buffet restaurants was below our expectations the shows and entertainment were great
unfortunately the customerguest on aida is in a fairly farback seat the only thing that aida is interested in is their money the arrival and departure were fraught with hassle example after checking in on board we had to wait over hours until we got our suitcases aida likes to put this special service in the foreground some of the staff were very unfriendly andor incompetent specifically two of the barkeepers on deck behind the theatrium not at the casino were rude and often answered very snippy questions the service staff on the outside deck in the weite welt restaurant sometimes made fun of the guests in their native language aida is simply a master of illusion they try to sell you rubbish as an additional profit of the days on board we were unable to use our balcony on days or only to a limited extent either it needed to be cleaned no idea which balcony was cleaned during that time ours wasnt or painted or the lifeboat was hanging right in front of our cabin not one word of apology of compromise or at least a free cocktail
huge ship great food great pool
we were on the nova the ship was simply too full it was a real battle in the buffet restaurants we had to go to the paid restaurants far too many strollers on board and in the aisles it was very loud no free seats empty glasses in and around the pools increased risk of injury the lowered buffet table in the fuego restaurant was a real breeding ground for germs kids were playing with their hands in the food its a shame their parents didnt intervene we also saw a child sneeze into it it was a complete disaster the only thing that was great were the destinations we visited and the onboard staff
its always nice to see something new entertainment and food are very good
it was a pleasant beautiful cruise the restaurant concept was topnotch we ate somewhere different every evening for dinner but unfortunately lunch was cancelled as we werent anymore we usually had breakfast at frech kiss and tried the gourmet breakfast in the steakhouse once it was very nice and quiet but a hefty price at at tui you could get almost the same for
great holiday feeling excellent food little to worry about
poor value for money overcrowded restaurants overcrowded pool area long waiting times when going ashore disturbance of privacy in the cabin days of workers working on private balcony poor selection of drinks four hours waiting time for luggage at the airport after the flight home
i wanted to leave a written complaint about what is happening during my unpleasant stay on one of your cruises through the canary islands and madeira indicate that the passengers who board in tenerife have not been treated and are not being treated the same as those who board in las palmas de gran canaria we have not been allowed to make purchases of excursions because the cruise set las palmas as its delivery date and passengers from tenerife are treated as second class passengers the booths dedicated to making reservations were empty there were no staff curiously they appeared when new people embarked in las palmas room service is very poor the staff on board is rude there is not a single source of water on the entire ship tomorrow is sea day we have a spa reserved for and suddenly they change our breakfast times delaying them an hour in short it is an accumulation of misfortunes that i could not expect from a shipping company like this
unfortunately aida cruises does not respond to criticism from guests drinks that were included in the allinclusive package were not available on a week route alternatives wine cost extra in the rossini or were not available the cabin creaked the issue was not taken seriously at reception apparently aida cruises does not really care about its guests even if they have already booked countless trips what a pity from now on tui cruises
the organization was very good in the area of checking in and out most things were stressfree the food was ok the bar area was very good the friendliness of the staff in the bar and restaurant area was overwhelming the way the organization mistakes were handled on the excursion on the last day was not professional the not very wellinformed employee was unable to cancel the excursion which clashed with the bus transfer to the airport as a goodwill gesture i found her to be stubborn and incompetent
zero servicewaiters deliberately ignore
no arab waiters accept guests from the east such as russians with bulgarian passports
mmmmmmmmm
service food and staff were top notch the industrial port routing far away from the travel highlights on the southeast asia trip was disappointing
good food in wide choice of restaurants too bad the a la carte restaurants are all fully booked many already make reservations at home friendly staff everything very clean shows of lower quality and of very short duration is a kind of animation team there is nothing left to do in the theater from pm the boat is very impressive cabins and beds very good
in november with the aida diva days caribbean from la romana rd great food and drinks selection cabin also very good only in the corridor there was a smell of manure on deck jacuzzis too small and not enough for so many people sunbeds very often reserved by towels and the crew does nothing about it very often the ship anchored very far from the actual harbor and landed with tender boats long walks were then almost impossible to do sightseeing and it was not published that walks were very long staff especially the entertainment manager jendrik beamed with fake friendliness not really friendly a request to him through reception was not answered and also not later after submitting it to aida otherwise everyone was very polite and helpful except the reception left a lot to be desired probably they didnt feel like it otherwise the trip was nice customer feedback to aida is not really received and is only answered after repeated reminders but not addressed so completely wrong as long as you are a paying guest you are fine that is not real customer loyalty which is a shame
many offers for excursions events sports wellness etc friendly staff good organization order cleanliness
everything is ok otherwise everything went well i am now giving the rd review where are the two previous articles i am concerned about the allocation of cabins we were on the aida cosma on a trip to the canary islands in january we made our booking in june there are sea view cabins with portholes on the cosma i didnt want an inside cabin or a balcony cabin because i have a tobacco allergy if the neighbors smoke on the balconies then i dont enjoy my balcony either last year we had a sea view cabin with a nice window on the prima why are the porthole cabins not given to those who book remaining space we were very disappointed
when i arrived my suitcase was put in front of another cabin and i had to look everywhere for it the toilet stank of old urine that had collected under the seat from the previous guests it stank horribly and even after the second cleaning it was no better no wonder if the same person who couldnt do it the first time gets sent again after the third cleaning it was ok there was no feedback or apology from reception just sad the buffet restaurants on the cosma are mercilessly overcrowded holidays are no fun like that thankfully there are other providers who take their guests seriously and for whom the wellbeing of their guests is more important than getting every euro it seems to me that the service staff are trained to fob off customers as best as possible when they have a complaint
the atmosphere and quality is lost on ships that are too big
the range and quality of the food in the buffet restaurants has deteriorated compared to the times before the pandemic the entertainment program in the theatrium was also not what it used to be very little
very mixed this orient tour was good venice tour was a big nuisance venice was not visited due to a quotformal errorquot very unpleasant complaint handling or ignorance
i am speechless all i could hear were drunken eastern european guests who behaved without decency and respect insulted the staff and filled bottles of drinks in the restaurant if this clientele is wantedthen good night and there were quite a few of them mostly in groups i felt sorry for the staff and what they had to endure
very nice staff good and extensive food selection very nice route denmark and norway at the right time of year january
the restaurants were better and customer friendliness could also be better
the entire cruise was a complete disaster from the service to the food and the bars the excursions offered and the condition of the ship rust in every corner elevators broken mostly unfriendly staff and mostly cold and tasteless food entertainment mostly lacking in quality
since finding a seat in the buffet restaurants is very timeconsuming the trip was otherwise very good only the stars
quality of the food
the truth about aida never again i have already traveled with aida in and so every years you could say back then twice with the aida mar now with the nova we are heading to scandinavia and right from the start i have to say there were huge differences the organization and the ability to handle everything smoothly yes there are an awful lot of people but it was just chaotic and took an extremely long time to get on the ship in retrospect the ship was much too big for me with the number of passengers our cabin wasnt made up at pm and looked like crap i even had a migraine and just wanted to get on the ship to rest we then had to wait half an hour outside the room what we liked however was the size of the cabin and that it was nicely furnished the veranda view was also nice on the first evening you saw the biggest idiots and idiots walking around one was even lying drunk in the hallway and peed there whats up with that are we at ballermann thats what happens when you offer alcoholic drinks to mentally immature people we were also standing on the balcony when we left and suddenly a quotfireballquot flew past us it looked like someone had crumpled up a giant piece of paper and then lit it on fire to throw it out the window extremely dangerous and impossible the service has absolutely deteriorated i have to say the housekeeping staff were very nice but what i experienced in the restaurantbars was appalling such listlessness and unfriendliness and absolutely inattentive i understand that the conditions on the ship are certainly not the best and i am very sorry about that again just out of economic greed but it should not be the case that when i am super friendly and smile i am met with an extremely ignorant arrogant and fucked up attitude that is simply not nice overcrowding to the max it was not only packed every time at mealtimes you were lucky if you managed to get a free seat whether early or late the people were simply not distributed well there were too many and at least of the passengers were babies and small children who were not exactly relaxing the food in general has also deteriorated extremely i actually found it worse than in any company or university canteen the selection was somehow very variable and yet hardly there as most of it was simply inedible then offer fewer things and look at the quality the dessert was the best and on the last evening smarter things were served up for the final impression on board this brings us to the next point all the psychological tricks that were somehow obvious that kind of thing disgusts me the whole program was a sales event everything cost extra or was used for a crossselling process you just dont get the feeling that the guest and their stay are the focus anymore but rather the economic advantage under the guise of good service which simply wasnt even there the excursions were overpriced and of course in coordination with other organizers or transport companies we explored everything on our own and otherwise just took a taxi it worked out well for us literally hardly more expensive than the aida shuttle if not cheaper i had a medical experience that was also abysmal euros for simply giving me an injection for my migraine i couldnt really get up but the doctor isnt quotallowedquot to go into the room when i was injured during the injection and i was really exhausted i was then told that i had perhaps never received the injected medication even though i had ordered it my autonomy and competence were denied just because they didnt have the balls to admit a mistake and played the ignorant patient card even though i went straight to the doctor with all the prior information about the illness and medication after years of migraines and was able to provide every expert information but thats the case with many doctors but if youre drunk on the first day theyll take care of you ok goodwill in general is also terrible we had a very unpleasant situation in the french kiss we didnt even get euros reimbursed there were so many sick people on the ship hardly anyone showed any consideration the clientele has also changed a lot but the destinations were fantastic and the best thing of all
pay more attention to older people improve food in buffet restaurants
it was a good holiday lots of choice of restaurants a la carte or buffet many bars to choose from you can relax or be active friendly staff lots of choice in the buffet restaurants excellent entertainment saw many music shows tip take a drinks package
the aida cosma is a monster with around passengers pushing and queuing at mealtimes is stressful the specialty restaurants are usually already fully booked the whole organization is bad the carpeted cabin balcony was not vacuumed thoroughly the staff tried hard but they couldnt do anything if the vacuum cleaner just didnt work as i was told chaos also when leaving the ship on lanzarote the way to the city continued hardly any taxis there we waited for over minutes finally walked others went back to the ship gave up chaos also on the day of departure the trip was anything but relaxed badly organized
the service or rather the staff at the individual bars was really bad the planned excursions were really great the rooms were great but we also had a few small problems with the room service all in all i would gladly go back to aida but definitely not the cosma
cleanliness on board friendliness offers on board excursions good food
everything well arranged staff friendly and everything neat and clean enough space for all passengers plenty of choice for food activities and relaxation
clear ship great service and food good shows very good organization
very good organisation friendliness of the crew members top quality and presentation of the food cleanliness in the ship and cabin high recreational value except when there are a lot of small children
the service staff in all areas and especially in the buffet restaurants were very attentive and friendly other competitors could learn a thing or two from this for example the breakfast coffee was brought quickly and abandoned tables were cleaned immediately
the food was not as varied as it was a year ago there was the same selection three days in a row
a great experience the design of the rooms restaurants pool areas etc is fantastic very good food and service great sports area on board
i like the mix of people young and old no set seating arrangements in the restaurants many inclusive restaurants no set meal times great entertainment programs various music acts good sports course program included lots of opportunities to go for a walk on board not so there are no places to retreat from the noise
aida is trying to find its place in the cruise market and is currently in the process of reducing quality in favor of costs and increasing quantity ie overcrowded ships with equally overcrowded restaurants and bars but fewer service staff and quality goods
kevin kellner at the aida bar knew on the third day which drinks our group people was drinking
after numerous trips and increasing arrogance conceit and ignorance of the employees im talking about the managers on board it will be the last time
some staff were unmotivated and there were very long waiting times at the bars little chance of getting a lounger drinks packages were not available because they were not available at all bars and were not even available we could only use our drinks package for half the price
one of the biggest ships ive ever been on purity
top ship very friendly staff exactly as expected
overall a nice cruise for us the excessive number of strollers and buggies on board was disturbing
the whole trip was fantastic starting with the service on board the housekeeping team and the firstclass service in the restaurants i would go again anytime
as mentioned in the survey it was not possible to eat meals in peace there was sometimes unbearable noise from the children i would also like to point out that i am not a child hater as i have children myself they are already grown up perhaps they could at least be served meals in the buffet restaurants separately from those who need peace and quiet either in terms of space or time
all inclusive by queuing aida you have to queue everywhere bad organization eg checkin checkout why are checkin slots booked when all guests have to stand in huge queues photo for boarding pass min wait at reception as of counters were occupied on the first day at sea ships doctor in the event of acute illness costs a flat rate of and is then unfriendly firsttime travelers are not informed about procedures eg all service restaurants are already fully booked before the start of the trip in the buffet restaurant always hunting for a table keep it occupied get food separately so two people can never eat together difficult to determine whether the restaurant concept is inclusive or payable the food in service restaurants is very good room service is top disinfectant dispensers are often empty hygiene regulations were only followed on the day of arrival then corona on board no information for guests although vulnerable people are on board corona test only possible with payment of from doctor
the quality of the food on board and the service used to be better you can see that savings are being made everywhere food staff even the sauna has to be paid for everything is very profitoriented i would have expected more for the price the aida onboard portal is really abysmally bad and is just frustrating which is something i dont need on vacation
cabin couple with year old child child not allowed to sleep in the wall folding bed too young so the couple were separated for the night and slept next to each other because the man had to sleep in the wall folding bed cm thin mattress after one night his back was sore every turn in the metal wall folding bed caused loud noises an additional cm thick mattress socalled quotmetal stopperquot had to be paid for euros but this did not improve the sleeping comfort it is actually a disgrace to offer this cabin to a couple with a year old child who was not allowed to sleep in this bed children who are of the permitted age may see such a wall bed as an quotadventurequot and feel completely at home there but at a certain age such a quotforcequot sleeping option is an absolute disgrace by the way for all three people in the additional comfortable double bed this double bed was unfortunately not wide enough
we booked as skeptics during black week and were simply curious to see what so many people think about the cruise now we know why and would go again at any time if the opportunity arose a few compromises when it came to vegetarian food
never again aida the staff do their best but everything is just basic and you could compare the cruise to ballermann at sea there is no real program during the day but there are selfish guests the food is rather mediocre always the same and cold rather than hot the paid restaurants on the other hand are good you can easily wait minutes at the bars for a drink you notice that after a few days no one wants to use the badly programmed elevators anymore and so you have to wait even longer but if you have booked the drinks package you can at least drink your way through your vacation there is nothing else to experience there anyway
in the bars there were often wrong drinks or even beers were not charged even though we were eating at the time we told reception times and each time we were told that it would be taken off the bill but to this day this has not happened
greetings from ballermann sloppy unfashionable overcrowded bathing area etc
aida nova norway amp denmark worst cruise to date we had booked a junior suite as a family with two small children which was very noisy we couldnt sleep until two in the morning because of the loud music this was complained about without any remedy as is usual with complaints from aida the food has deteriorated considerably and there wasnt even broccoli reserved for meal times it was really just the cheapest of the cheap an outrage for the money priceperformance ratio is no longer right at all some of the staff were very unfriendly and arrogant im not sure how proud these people are of themselves this will definitely be our last time with aida there are far better providers
fighting for a table in the restaurant queues and at least minutes waiting time at the bars the ship the nova is very nice but the conditions surrounding food and drink are unacceptable
simply bad from the staff to the programs which they mostly want money for to the overcrowded crowds on the entire ship only children only sick and primitive people bad food the same thing every day and the quality lets not even get started on that the service is terrible from start to finish the fact is that aida only wants the best for you and that is your money simply sad
its always a shame that some people without a drinks package fill everything up in liter bottles or take drinks with them to the bars every day all day and thus block the quotstationsquot and unnecessarily quotmake a messquot
this cruise was a little disappointing compared to the last ones the quality of the food wasnt bad but the selection was limited its surprising when a bar runs out of draft beer especially since most of the guests were on land
i have never had a problem with the staff but this time they were unusually unfriendly and the reception staff treated me with a rude attitude i dont know that from aida
it was very relaxing the range of activities was varied and interesting the culinary offerings were very good
too little and not very good entertainment the food was not great it was a holiday
we didnt like that there was no free water in the cabins
they charge a lot of money but let the guest fly with the cheapest banana airline ryanair auda shame on you
i again advocate for entire areas for balcony cabins to be designated as smokefree unfortunately we again had room neighbors who were chain smokers which is extremely annoying there are too many smoking areas outside in general and i dont understand why smokers are almost given preference it seems like this is your new target group some smokers have even creatively expanded their area and moved the smoking sign to get more space to smoke no one from the crew has responded towels and reservations do i really have to explain it or do you know what i mean there are people who build real castles out of beach chairs loungers and chairs to sit down in isnt that going too far since no one is taking action against this kind of behavior it is becoming more and more brazen this ship was the first to have severely limited selection of drinks especially cocktails at most bars my favorite cocktail quot milesquot was only available once at the lanai bar and nowhere else because it was supposedly unavailable thats not how i imagine a firstclass deluxe drinks package to be the room smelled very musty when we moved in for a tip of someone came and sprayed the carpet with air freshener which helped i also had my pillow replaced because the filling had already sagged and clumped together the quality of the food has gone down a lot compared to previous aida cruises this was particularly noticeable in the brewery the french kiss and also in the buffets the selection and especially the quality of the baked goods is disappointing and could be improved msc and tui are worlds better in this regard the pizza in mamma mia is more like a cracker than a real pizza you can do better like the pizzeria on the aida bella for example nothing new but the cake desserts are really below your level it cant be that difficult to bake decent cakes what you offer looks like a chemical mixture of colored cream with flavor additives unfortunately this mixture is the same in almost every cake dessert only the color and aroma are different that is really disappointing your reservation system for the specialty restaurants is also very inconvenient when we boarded on wednesday all seats were already fully booked until saturday we found out that saturday is apparently the day on which the onboard portal is activated for the coming week we then reserved all available dates for the remaining days it even seems to be possible to book several dinner dates on one day wouldnt it make more sense if each guest could only make dinner reservations for nights we experienced many disappointed and angry guests complaining to the restaurant counter because everything was always fully booked better planning of reservation allocation would be desirable all in all we will never book such a large ship again the atmosphere is in no way comparable to the sphinx class in so many places we had the impression of quantity instead of quality and of costoptimized service we dont like aida like that anymore
my first vacation on an aida in my case the aida nova beautiful ship lots to offer lots of attractions and lots of options for food unfortunately very crowded and not always able to find a seat at the restaurant you choose but then youll find one at the next restaurant at the latest the swimming pool is unfortunately not so great for children in diapers the only small pool for them doesnt feel like the water is that warm the other pools feel warmer but again children in diapers arent allowed in those the worst thing for me are the elevators and the button to close the door as a person with a child by the hand or a stroller its hard to get into an elevator almost everyone just presses the button to close the door in the elevator so that with a stroller you have little chance of getting to the elevator door in time the one or sometimes two people in the elevator move on thats the only but very strong point that has bothered me over and over again it would be great if you could deactivate this button anywhere in the elevator so that other people could also use the elevator properly
review excursions better adjust meals adjust beverage packages
top ship great people on board
not suitable for allergy sufferers or people with walking difficulties there was no mobility assistance on arrival and departure despite multiple registrations so this was associated with considerable pain for me the food is not adequately labelled for allergy sufferers or is even incorrectly labelled you are forced to ask about the allergen content of each individual dish and the staff apart from the diet officer cannot help very tedious the diet counter is minimalist in design with a dessert one day there was a dry cake and a starter with not particularly friendly staff every kebab stand does it better with a list of allergens contained in the food posted
no significant criticisms no queues at the buffet restaurants you didnt notice that there were guests on the ship
negative the food was very average the drinks deluxe package was a rip off only free in certain restaurants and liquor was not available at all full restaurants premium internet for euros was a joke the coffee was absolutely bad and at night there was a disco until am the towels stank when drying off that was the first and last trip with aidastella
it was our first time on a cruise the ship was far too crowded with travelers long waiting times at the buffet service elevators gateway too little information eg about the itinerary checkout bathing areas very cold water and outside temperature positive onboard staff super very friendly courteous top housekeeping very clean shows on board highly recommended
very good service great selection of restaurants and bars very good quality food and drinks beautiful design of the ship and the various locations you just feel very comfortable on aida no matter whether it is a very large or a smaller ship
beautiful ship mostly friendly staff unfortunately the food is mostly terrible no comparison to other ships like msc cocktail bar people waiting bartenders minutes to get a cocktail breakfast frozen butter every day thats a joy it was our first and last time with aida
unfortunately the shipping company which was actually such a great company seems to be degenerating into a russian steamer the increasing number of russian passengers led to massive tensions among the guests who rightly complained about their fellow travelers from the terrorist state and their behavior
imagine a big holiday trip with something different hardly any decorations not even the tables were decorated at christmas savings are being made
overall it was a nice vacation despite the allinclusive option you always had to check what you could order thats a bit tiring especially the first few days a bit of information at checkin would be helpful preferably in paper form easier to read than on tv eat out as soon as the restaurant opens stay on the ship in the morning and on land in the afternoon thats more relaxed always against the crowds
we traveled with the aida novametropolen from hamburg for the first time in january the room with a window was nice we had a small walkin closet which was very practical what bothered us was the trampling that you could always hear loudly from above the doors that were constantly slamming and some pumps we think that were always on at night too what was positive was that we didnt hear the music from the shows in the room the ship was booked on our trip we always had to spend a long time looking for a seat in the buffet restaurant you then had to reserve the seat with a jacket etc the buffet was always very busy so a relaxed meal was not possible what we also found a shame was that we had booked an excursion a mini cruise on the maas we stood in the cold for about minutes until we were told that the excursion was canceled due to a defect in the boat there was no concession from aida we just got our money back we would have liked to have booked another excursion for the same price after all you only have one day to explore the city all in all we wouldnt travel with aida again what a shame
unfortunately the priceperformance ratio has deteriorated considerably people are cutting corners in the wrong places the excursions are extremely overpriced and do not promise what they pay for the cabins and balconies are very dirty the paint is peeling off everywhere then there is the morning deck chair marathon its crazy why cant they warn people after half an hour and then collect the towels after pm there is no food everything is closed not to mention the shopping arcade it feels like it has never been open in the allinclusive package i can get drunk on litres of jack daniels but i have to pay for the amaretto with my coffee no room service no food to go from the pizzeria only one entrance is open and you can no longer get slices of pizza to go you have to sit in the restaurant and then the men wear long trousers for dinner whats that about its obvious that men dont come dancing in their swimming trunks then the route how can you be at sea on new years eve and then be in antigua on january st where everything is closed because of the holiday bad planning for those departing individually leaving the ship at am is extremely early and not customerfriendly the internet entertainment the smokerfriendliness and the very friendly staff are all worth mentioning
i expected something different from a cruise aida is probably made for the overweight german rabble poor hygiene a lack of complaint management chaotic information inadequate heating in the cabin underline the audience who even come to dinner in flipflops and white sports socks the entertainment manager and extremely likeable captain unfortunately cannot hide the amateurish stage show except for the acrobatics and the earsoreinducing singing however if you are looking for an allyoucaneat eatingbingeing party aida is the perfect place for you
staff rather stressed getting a sun lounger is almost impossible always occupied even though nobody uses them a painful issue nothing is done about it no chance of booking restaurants on site everything is booked top shows especially night fly club
ballermann ship next door there was a party every night people smoked illegal substances service staff were overwhelmed complaints to reception were useless
a varied holiday the best service varied meals and exciting shows
the route was amazing the arrival and departure with sunexpress was a disgrace despite paying a lot for xxl seats per person x mind you with a stopover it was a disaster no drinks for hours on the plane staff retreated behind curtains to chat seats were cramped worn out as if squashed in and all for a lot of money cocktails on the ship drowned in ice cubes staff shortages cleanliness not as usual blankets in the cabins not cleaned by the previous owner here it is more about quantity than quality you get the feeling that the food is very delicate unfortunately often cold a shame we were used to better
it was our first cruise and we were surprised at how well everything was organized the entire staff was always super friendly
the ship and the excursions were all very good except for the meals which were a nightmare you feel like you were at a fair
it was a lovely cruise the nova is a very large ship on days at sea it gets quite cramped because there were a lot of children on board the noise level was not for the fainthearted in the beach club and was very annoying but the food was good and the staff very friendly and helpful
far too much attention to alcohol consumption by the staff at shows and interviews always eating german food during a trip in the indian ocean no go always playing pop music and shouting guests during the pool parties i might as well fly to ballermann in mallorca the pool deck is occupied and unused during the day no consistent solution to the problem by aida screaming balkan drunken guests who made it impossible for other guests to relax overpriced aida excursions of very poor quality
the ship is very large not enough open areas the pool bar is inside
canary islands everything went according to plan clean ship delicious food everything at the highest level and super organized flight transfer checkin
the rating refers to a day canary islands tour with the aida cosma in january we traveled with our monthold son very good offers service food and staff were top notch no influence on the rating the inside cabin was very small the baby bed basically used up the remaining space this is where the motto becomes clear how do i manage to build the maximum possible number of cabins in order to increase profits as much as possible the share price of the parent company carnival corporation plc must be brought back to quotprecovid levelsquot quickly absolutely not possible the quotsafety briefingquot is an absolute nogo this can be completed digitally so far so good we did this then why the hell are there cabin announcements about the same topic from pm to pm the announcements are at such a volume that our offspring naturally woke up straight away there is no way to stop them you wonder why they do this crap digitally absolute nonsense and to make matters worse on day many passengers left the ship or came on board so we had this crap twice on a day trip that definitely gave us two less than relaxing evenings thats why its quotonlyquot stars much more emphasis should be placed on family friendliness or the option should be given to completely suppress the announcements if they were made digitally beforehand
it was our first cruise the facilities and room with veranda were great we had booked vario with premium drinks otherwise aida nova was a big ship and everything was very very full restaurants open in the evening from pm to pm always had long queues hectic and crowded the soft drink machines were turned off at am and pm sharp even if you were still standing there then you had to queue for about minutes at the bar for a coke very annoying we had booked two different internet packages neither of which worked the excursions we booked were expensive but nice we couldnt fault the cleanliness
an overcrowded ship hectic at the buffets always looking for a place in the restaurant masses of people walking through the buffets because the restaurants are built in a tube shape the cabin on deck was always loud until very late at night because of the parties in the beach club deck a big ship doesnt mean more space just a lot more people we have previously been on other cruises with other shipping companies and would not book aida again
some light unfortunately also a lot of shade we spent days on the aida nova unfortunately overcrowded dining rooms a lack of communication from the ship and canteenlevel food spoiled our holiday getting a free table was a matter of luck the buffet was in combat mode medical emergencies were broadcast to the cabin over the loudspeakers even at am the night was over i hope that all those affected are ok as a guest on the ship i had absolutely nothing to do with these operations and it really spoils the holiday feeling drinks sometimes took minutes even for a simple coke or sprite we searched in vain for a quiet spot unfortunately the shows werent really our thing either hot pot and the time machine were highly recommended and really enhanced the holiday including the staff who tried very hard and at times simply couldnt cope with the masses of people aida could not be convincing with their drinks concept where despite everything being all inclusive you still have the feeling that you have to pay extra for everything a lack of communication at checkin and throughout the entire trip unfortunately made the vacation unnecessarily difficult the adia app needs a lot of improvement unfortunately the aidia nova is a ship like an amusement park and is set up like that the whole concept is designed for partying you wont find a vacationrelaxation in a quiet spot not our vacation and i probably wouldnt book aida again even though the price was very tempting other providers are better at it
i found it very impressive how big a cruise ship can be the equipment on each individual deck is also remarkable the variety of activities and offers means you can spend your free time in a variety of ways the range of different dishes is very large and there is something for every taste i found the noise disturbing at times whether it was from unsupervised children running around the ship or in the restaurants at meal times in the buffet restaurants the dishes and cutlery were often cleared away and sorted very loudly at the service stations eating in peace was not always possible
everything is good keep it up just do a little more for vegetarians more choice of food
buffet restaurants resemble a cafeteria food selection is catastrophic we were even very disappointed in the steak restaurant long waiting times at the bars because there is no system behind it the stage program and entertainment were very entertaining children and toddlers are now allowed in the spa and sauna area as they lure in family offers such as quot euros for hours with the whole familyquot the staff in the spa area and in the fitness studio were very competent and friendly the housekeeping team did a great job all week a lot of time wasted on passport controls all in all not recommended as they are only trying to cut costs instead of creating a holiday experience for guests
food bad vanilla sauce like dishwater no refills breaded meat dries out service bad not attentive like robots
was a total aida fan but unfortunately things have changed for the worse the sauna can suddenly only be booked by the hour and paid for separately the service is very unfriendly and you even have to be nicely dressed in the buffet restaurants no more shorts that doesnt mean you have to go to the restaurant looking dirty even if you come back from an excursion and just want to get a little something the party is probably on another ship and the excursions were very overpriced what a pity unfortunately the last time
i have now made my second trip with the aida nova the first was over new years eve everything was still great and beautiful now i was on the ship in october disaster the staff just dont feel like it anymore sometimes unfriendly we waited an average of minutes for drinks the cleanliness on the ship also left a lot to be desired in the restaurants the tables were cleared far too slowly the tables were often dirty the staff preferred to talk to each other the shows were ok but could have been better for me it was the last trip for now i am really disappointed oh and the childcare should be reconsidered everything used to be better a shame
standing in line at the bar sauna for a fee arrival and departure package was a total disappointment checkin hours in advance was not possible and so couples and families with children had to sit separately on all flights new years eve show was a total disaster pensioner band with inappropriate songs
cruises disembarked sick
aida has changed its status for the worse you can see the savings in all positions in order to squeeze out every last cent tour with aida blue from madagascar housekeeping was more a matter of luck you wait a long time for drinks there is the slowest coffee machine in the world the entertainment over new years eve was sobering the quotparty shipquot myth is a thing of the past the food in the restaurants has become rather mediocre the list goes on and on it has become a pure quotcash cowquot for example a latte macchiato costs without a drinks package and is really mediocre all shore excursions are significantly overpriced compared to other cruise operators what is good what best burgersea and silentparty the comparison here is with a total of other cruises
more and more austerity bad service shabby ship run down dirty and unkempt
we felt very comfortable on the aida nova the service and the staff were really great almost everyone was always very attentive and super friendly the food even though we are really spoiled by now was excellent everything was perfect including the price as our two children aged and traveled completely free of charge where else can you find something like that we have already booked the next cruise with aida
i dont like the solution with the drinks menu
unfortunately the good old days at aida are over after years with aida and a good trips i really asked myself whether it was still for me the new ships are much too big too many people no real relaxation anymore on the cosma i didnt even get a chair to sit on on days at sea on the prima it was a bit more relaxed on the prima there were no pool towels after midday and they werent refilled either waiting times for drinks were sometimes minutes and you had to queue in the past for example you couldnt even see how quickly a waiter at the pool had brought a new drink now there were no waiters at all on the cosma there were no full drinks menus anymore just a small selection menu and each bar had its own selection of drinks i wanted to drink something other than beer and be inspired by the menu no way then no my onboard bills were correspondingly low i did the math for a weeks trip and my travel price every minute of the vacation costs me cents that means i pay for a minute wait and then another for my drink the food is boring and nowhere near as good as it used to be vegetables and potatoes are sometimes almost raw scrambled eggs in the morning are almost always lukewarm to cold the latte macchiato from the older wmf machine in the buffet restaurant hardly has any coffee in it and only tastes of milk you have to run after the table drinks red winewhite wine in the buffet restaurant because the hardworking but stressed clearers dont really have time for them in the past they were always right on the table isnt there a central point where you can get the carafes yourself im annoyed at always having to wait for the waiter who hardly has any time the choice of food in the buffet restaurant has become much smaller on the new ships due to the many paid restaurants the aida post which you always enjoyed reading is no longer available in your cabin you can get it somewhere if you can still get something because of the environment aha the internet is a disaster not to mention the prices if you leave the ship you have to log in again and again when you come back it was a lot of work to activate it without the aida app the reception gave me the wrong link or one that didnt work boardportalaidaprima but internetaidaprima worked i managed to get it working with my loved ones after an hour i wonder how older guests do it there have also been a few improvements in recent years for example checkin has become quicker and the cabins are ready very early
never again aida diva only mass processing and poor quality food very long wait at the bars for a glass of water or soft drink
continue to make the passengers happy
they sell every cabin even if its the broom cupboard and they dont respond to complaints thats points for customer service so you dont need to ask these questions afterwards our vacation was nice when we were off the boat
the atmosphere on board was always good the service and friendliness of the staff was better help with problems was dismissed or referred to other colleagues who then couldnt or didnt want to really help
unfortunately everything is slowly becoming scarce in some cases the service is only maintained by the efforts of individual employees the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was worse than ever before the interior is worn out much is dirty the quality of the food and drinks is getting worse and worse many things and more are becoming more and more expensive hygiene concepts are promoted as the best but are not adhered to by the staff themselves the price and performance simply no longer match
unfortunately massive savings are being made at the expense of employees and guests there are far too few service staff and the quality and variety of food has declined drinks excursions and additional services such as sauna use are priced higher or are not priced at all
a paradise for chain smokers apparently at aida socializing is a synonym for unrestricted smoking pleasure in almost all public areas of the ship even in the few designated nosmoking zones somehow the aida advertising which is aimed at young beautiful people or families does not reflect the reality of nicotine fingers smokers cough pale emaciated faces and the cold haze from ashtrays this bad impression is a great shame for the always hardworking extremely friendly crew the good condition of even the older ships the still quite passable food and the beautiful destinations
poor service at the bars and long waiting times at the buffet restaurants the internet didnt work most of the time even though we booked a package otherwise the destination was excellent
good organization delicious food many events good service
food significantly reduced unqualified staff toilet in balcony cabin too small i weigh kg
intransparent dirty cabins and balconies expensive
i immediately felt at home on board i had underestimated the length of the ship after i had chosen my favorite restaurant there were about m between my cabin and my meal but you have time and sore muscles pass thanks for the experiences
food worse than in any company canteen meatballs chicken legswings fish fingers chicken liver every day
very loud at night you cant sleep until the party is over staff often ignorant and not in the midst of travelers
service entertainment and culinary offerings
impressive ship with a great friendly atmosphere very clean well organized and very good culinary offerings
it was my first time travelling on the cosma and i was concerned about the number of passengers but all my concerns were in vain i felt comfortable
whether you like cruises or not is up to you we probably wont be big fans ourselves but basically the aidas do a great job without exception all the workers were nice the food was great the shows were entertaining and the fact that a ship rocks is because its floating on the sea we thought you wouldnt notice it as much otherwise everything was great
never again aidabella loud booming music from the open pool bar makes it impossible to sleep until am in some cases transverse vibrations of the superstructure are bad for the stomach even with waves as low as m homeopathic placebos not antihistamines are given out as quottravel tabletsquot no free shuttle buses in the ports instead transport prices that are disproportionate to the service very bad air due to old carpets the whole ship was cooled down very strongly perhaps because of the quotcarpetquot air because of the cooling many people on board caught colds in the rossini parquet the air was immediately much better the ship urgently needs to be completely renovated and the carpet has to be removed pros showers were easy to adjust the food in the rossini was as good as usual if i recommend aida then the big aidas cosma amp co they can do more dont upset your stomach and have a much better program and up until now they also had free shuttle buses we had already booked two more trips with the bella singaporedubai and mallorcahamburg and canceled them straight away despite the very high cancellation fees due to this quotholiday tripquot experience i think that speaks for itself
we always found aida to be particularly childfriendly and preferred them but compared to other cruise lines our opinion is very low this mainly affects the service and entertainment there is definitely a lack of staff in the restaurants what a shame
too many people on one ship shows had to be booked hours in advance so that they could be enjoyed during the shows the area was overcrowded and getting drinks was difficult the pool area was cold as was the water the whirlpool in the outdoor area was only lukewarm so we couldnt use it the cocktails ie drinks were much better than on the msc so you could drink not recommended for winter not enough alternative options was more stressed afterwards than before
the ship aida nova is unfortunately too big for the staff employed and the conception of the individual areas unfortunately not so good for children all areas were far too crowded
aida diva has improved significantly in terms of service compared to the past very friendly and helpful the restaurants offerings were varied and tasty the quality of rossini was a very positive surprise and both the quality of the food and the preparation as well as the presentation were of a high standard
very well organized trip interesting excursions friendly staff good food with a wide selection
we did the new years eve trip with the aida nova we are adults and children checkin went very well if you stick to the time youve been given and dont arrive earlier or later it goes smoothly our cabin veranda deluxe was very nice and surprisingly spacious everyone felt comfortable the buffet restaurants are all good unfortunately we had a lot of trouble getting a table with people especially in the east restaurant you should allow for an hours queue if you want a table there the other buffet restaurants were fine it took us about minutes to find a table unfortunately we couldnt get a table in the other restaurants because of the number of people we didnt want to reserve in advance because wed never been on the ship before and we didnt want to mess up our vacation we thought we could try it spontaneously which turned out to be a big mistake unfortunately the time machine is nothing more than a childrens theater we had expected it unfortunately the food was nothing special and not very well prepared children had mashed potatoes with nuremberg sausages the show consisted of people the story that was told had nothing to do with a time machine our children thought it was great apart from the food if we had only gone in as a couple we would have been more than disappointed the kids club was nothing for our children we have been to many family hotels and all the care there was much better than on the aida children were bored they were only allowed to do crafts and paint little entertainment no activities on the ship the children called the kids club prison our eldest who is years old almost was not even allowed to go to the toilet alone it is also a shame that it is very inflexible you have to have decided by pm the evening before when you want to bring your child the next day if you only come at pm to make a reservation for the next day you will not get your preferred time because it is fully booked there were children on the ship and the area is much too small for that why are there no board games in the kids area unfortunately we didnt get the mystery room or climbing because we werent prepared to queue for an hour at reception on the day of arrival to book it after that it was fully booked unfortunately shore excursions for families are far too expensive not interesting for our children either there was nothing on offer that interested our children i would definitely advise older people who are a bit slower on their feet not to go on this ship if youre not quick you simply wont get a table sitting at a table with other people now and then is absolutely fine but it shouldnt be a permanent situation we met a lot of older people who were really angry overall it was a nice trip but unfortunately with a lot of drawbacks for the price you pay you should think carefully about it
the surcharges for onboard catering are in no way in proportion to the overall service the same applies to the only aida excursion we booked
a feeling of unimportance of the client is created at the reception they even allow themselves to keep a tone with people and scold them a great deal of disorder on board they didnt even have laundry bags and they wouldnt take my laundry the coffee machine i had ordered in my cabin was taken from me on the third day without any explanation i had to waste half a day waiting in lines at a reception where only one person was working like most of the time and asking for an explanation then it turned out that they took it from one of the ships bars because they needed it the excursions were under all criticism almost only german was spoken everywhere the service at the outside bars is very bad the bartenders and waiters allow themselves to make inappropriate jokes with the ladies overall very bad
information difficult to access extremely long waiting times at the bar overall not a pleasant holiday feeling on board activities and entertainment rather poor
incredibly well organized everything clean varied and highquality food very friendly staff varied entertainment program absolutely recommended and always worth a trip
if you go to aida please go to one of the smaller ships our vacation on aida cosma was the worst vacation on aida so far the restaurants were often overcrowded there were often no plates left the buffets were plundered and were not refilled for a long time you constantly had the feeling that you had dirty dishes everything felt somehow sticky we have never experienced aida as badly as on this trip
the oriental evening did not meet my expectations and was overpriced
the pool area outside temperature amp water temperature on the aidanova is much too cold we were there once and then never again the waiters take a long time to serve the number of guests the cabin doors can hardly be closed quietly which is why it is very loud the theater is in our opinion completely wrongly placed there is hardly any opportunity to retreat have a drink and chat it feels like you are bombarded with noise whether you want it or not there are far too few seats in or at the bars for the number of guests we often had the problem of not being able to get a seat and so had to go to one of the restaurants as soon as these close however you are quotthrown outquot and you are faced with the same problem again the restaurants opening hours are very short especially if you have booked a shore excursion which is why the restaurants are constantly completely overcrowded it is almost impossible to get a seat in the theme restaurants these are fully booked for the entire week from the start of the trip extra money is charged for coffee ice cream and special cocktails despite the largest drinks package climbing course mini golf etc are also charged extra you can either offer allinclusive and get it or you can leave it
incredibly bad management on board little sleep noise at least a minute wait for drinks broken pools arrival and departure not organized in a customerfriendly manner everything fully booked overpriced excursions that dont do what they say everything costs extra restaurants always fully booked far too small for so many people not enough staff on board everyone is overwhelmed and in a bad mood hospital on board cannot be reached in an emergency simple entertainment at am its bedtime we were on the prima i dont know what its like on the other ships but theres still a lot of room for improvement here customer satisfaction is a low priority here what a pity a lot of money paid for very little service
in our opinion dance classes specialty restaurants if youre lucky to get a table parties overcrowded so long queues coffee machine in room for an extra charge spa for an extra charge many things for an extra charge staff unfriendly listlessdisinterested sunbeds are reserved and the crew does nothing about it
overcrowded poor program partly not well organized copayments everywhere
the booked ship was too full there were queues everywhere free seats in bars or cafes were hard to find
just train the staff before a trip it cant be compared to my ship too many guests too few staff
the staff especially at reception urgently need training everyone says something different no one really knows what theyre doing and many of the staff need to practice being friendly theyre often very unfriendly even rude and unmotivated ill think twice about going on another cruise with aida not the way it is now a lot of things have to change
had a great holiday on the ship cosma the food was good and the staff were very nice with new years eve there was obviously a lot going on on the ship but everything was well distributed you have to be a bit flexible when there is a lot going on in one place everything was perfect for us and we will definitely go again
the quotorient quot itinerary was good it was possible to split it between beach and relaxation we saw some great places the theater shows were great the return trip was a nightmare aida allocated its reserved seats at random so small children years and younger had to sit alone swapping was only possible at the behest of the seat neighbors as the plane was fully booked the reception is weak when it comes to questions about the flight meals for the plane eg lactosefree must be ordered at least day before departure not as the reception lady said at checkin on the day of departure reserving loungers was terrible ordering drinks took forever
poor service overcrowded restaurants bad restaurant opening times including people being thrown out at closing times poor presentation of the food and too little variety despite quotthemed restaurantsquot endless queues we never got a holiday feeling additional services for sauna coffee drinks only available for an additional charge booked premium internet for and got modem speed absolute ripoff even the staff on site were clueless and knew the problem not a single lifeguard at the pools but it felt like people cleaning hopefully nothing ever happens with what feels like children in one pool other chains are much better at this conclusion quotmuch more show than substancequot
i took my first cruise with aidasol more than years ago and was absolutely thrilled i liked everything unfortunately the quality is steadily declining and especially after corona i can no longer recommend aida and advise against a cruise with aida i was last on aidaperla and aidanova in even the checkin in hamburg is extremely slow and is simply not scaled high enough for the size of the ship especially aidanova this makes this first part of the trip a small stress test there are three main things that have gotten worse on board firstly you are constantly confronted with quotoffersquot upselling at every corner i dont feel like im on an quotallinclusive vacationquot that aida offered years ago bars excluded the feeling of a living cash cow that needs to be milked is sometimes a better description secondly the ships are not designed for the number of passengers when it comes to open areas the bigger the ship the worse the situation for the evening show in the theatrium you have to fight for seats sometimes literally the tone between the guests and the atmosphere can get rough this also has little to do with vacation the cast of the shows the aida stars is getting worse and worse which even the best lighting and sound effects of the newer shows cannot compensate for otherwise it is difficult to find a seat in the open areas especially on sea days it is impossible to find a quiet place because music is playing everywhere and not exactly quietly the situation in the restaurants is just as chaotic which brings us to the third point the quality of the restaurants is at an absolute low the fact that you have to be the first there to fight for your seat on sea days and often on quotnormalquot days is one thing but what bothers me more is the declining quality of the food the new years eve trip with aidanova is an example in each of the restaurants the food was the same every evening this point did not bother me but is of course a step back from the variety of the past when there was a quotthemequot per restaurant and corresponding dishes every evening personally i am much more bothered by the fact that the food is usually only lukewarm the meat becomes tougher and drier with each trip and a lot of fat and sugar is used overall the vegetables in particular are often very fatty or salty in the past they were fried until crispy or gently cooked which not only made them much tastier and of higher quality but above all healthier the standard has also dropped on new years eve and the last evening farewell dinner in the past there were highquality tables and exclusive dishes eg lobster on both evenings particularly in view of the price development of the trips this should be possible on the new years eve trip at least on new years eve but that was not the case these days now feel much more like any other apart from the better clothing of the waiters as described in the three points above the quality is also declining significantly in other areas overall i can therefore currently january only advise against traveling with aida the large ships in particular are not recommended on the smaller ships at least the space situation is more relaxed
simple and too big we were on the aidacosma everything was pretty and nice but nothing more the concept cant keep up with the number of people there are queues everywhere to get on board crowds in the buffet restaurant the evening entertainment is like german tv nice but unmotivated the food was always good but rather average the staff was friendly but more concerned with satisfying the masses the entertainment well good in itself but more like a musical they just do their program the cabin was ok everyone we spoke to said the same thing and was cruiseexperienced
arrival perfect departure perfect food and rooms are fine clean and tidy far too many people standing and waiting everywhere unfortunately not relaxing for me staff very helpful and friendly i think the excursions are overpriced entertainment is great drinks selection is great
our first cruise and an experience for us its always a matter of taste and we had gathered a lot of opinions beforehand many of my criticisms may not be a problem for other guests first of all the cabins were great clean and the ship was in impeccable condition the ship was fully booked and the northern route meant that it was almost never possible to use the outdoor area accordingly the ship was so full that you often had to look for a seat in the restaurant in the evenings on sea days there was no quiet area on the entire ship and a seat for people was practically impossible to find at the bars it sometimes took minutes for drinks to be served if you were even noticed at all we often quotescapedquot to the cabin just to take a breather if you can deal with queues and crowds a cruise on large ships is certainly a great thing we were rather disappointed with the quality of the food and the large number of people in certain areas and would therefore not book again otherwise the service and cleanliness on the aida are beyond any doubt
unfortunately very crowded in the freely accessible areas eg beach club elements but also in bars and restaurants at peak times often associated with a long search for a seat probably unavoidable with the number of passengers the only option to retreat is in the cabin facilities entertainment program food and service are good wellness area very good for an additional charge
here the guest is treated like a king
aida cosma ab teneriffa the ship was too full with too few staff especially in the catering section of restaurantsbars couldnt make a reservation for christmas so had to searchwait for hours resulting in a cold buffet that was actually closing staff irritatedsometimes slightly aggressive no christmas decorations in the restaurants nor have i seen a special christmas menubuffet in the buffet restaurants other yearsships have we were with friends for the st time so it was a huge downer we could not access the board portal during the first half of the trip so no countryport information we could not make a reservation in advance or book a restaurant it only became accessible again from the next transfer port gan canaria which would be the new trip according to the reception strange for all who boarded with us in tenerief
after about cruises with aida all over the world i have now booked another days on aida perla in the caribbean for new years eve after corona but we were sorely disappointed a new booking system with an mde device means that you have to wait forever for drinks not only that booking scoops of ice cream in the ice cream parlor took a whole minutes drinks in the theater often took minutes an espresso at the buffet a whole minutes the food was naturally cold every guest had a cold when the outside temperature is degrees the ship is extremely cold there is a draft everywhere if you get on the ship sweaty you get a cold straight away everyone really every guest complained about it the excursion program was extremely bad and overpriced im happy to pay for a good excursion but what we experienced here was almost outrageous we waited hours for an hours cable car ride we would still be standing there if some guests hadnt caused a ruckus the aida guide was completely overwhelmed the app is a disaster you cant find important information the booking system doesnt work in places our room for example had no wifi which i had booked for people each for over etc never again aida
simple food in the canteens would be ok if all the food and drinks were at least averagely well prepared some of the food was obviously not tasted before being served
the company could be even better if the older ship diva was in better shape
very clean delicious food very nice staff
i think its a shame that such a mistake has created such a negative taste
not inclusive and only for german speaking guests the specialty restaurant needs to be reserved in advance with limited place ruined the relaxing mood and itinery changed without active notice and recompensation
the service and the food were excellent the cabins were great the cocktails were delicious only the excursions are very expensive
star ship your staff in the wide world restaurant are just adorable the chef arnel cooked a special ginger drink with herbs for us when we were sick on the ship he was great and so were all the staff andrew jervin alvic and alester we felt very special the lego shop was small but unforgettable my child and his cousins loved going there every evening the play corner was great your colleague jecil sumido is an example of professionalism and friendliness she knows every detail about lego when the new one comes out etc she remembered our name and gave time for a little chat mrs jecil always makes sure to greet our son when he plays there very sweet thank you we felt particularly nice thank you very much
nice staff we were able to relax enjoyed the bars and it was never boring and the crowds were well distributed
never again completely overcrowded ship even the staff are at a loss and openly admit that the cosma is totally overbooked the most disgusting way to travel never ever again
the signage on board is not the real thing there are no instructions about which deck you are on long searches for free tables during meals lots of running around as a nonsmoker you are surrounded by smokers on the balcony on the left and right annoying
eating is the last thing the ossi men sit at dinner wearing shorts no socks and long toenails
waiting staff in restaurants and bars totally overwhelmed never again over the christmas holidays on aida perla
i am generally satisfied but there is still room for improvement aida should enforce the guidelines they have set and the small print and then a lot would have been done this includes above all the dress code in the restaurants
day seven on the aida diva for the second time all toilets are closed the day after new years eve the breakfast buffet closes promptly at am the coffee machine is broken at breakfast time yesterday it had to be cleaned at breakfast time the clock on the pool deck if you could call it that has been showing pm for at least seven days yesterday both whirlpools were broken all day
we liked the offerings in the theater and the silent party and the food and service in the restaurant were also very good as usual we did not like the lack of entertainment by the hosts nor the cancellation and deletion of offerings that were listed in the program without any information many restaurants are walkthrough restaurants which creates a restlessness and discomfort the quotwelcome homequot feeling is unfortunately more apparent on the smaller ships
modern wellequipped ships uncomplicated concept but with style great entertainment great shows and great bands sports and spa area simply brilliant children are in good hands very good hygiene and safety concept
location of the junior suite is a total disaster people walk through the front and look into the cabin during the day many of them lie right in front of their own balcony there is an anteroom that takes up half the cabin and is only useful for storing suitcases as there is no air conditioning lots of families with children aged and above if you have a screaming child as a neighbor like we do you can forget about sleeping with the thin walls the standard of the guests both in terms of clothing and otherwise is more in line with cheap and boozy tourism even among the suite guests you sometimes end up on the sun terrace in a towel and a bottle of champagne its vacation after all the excursions are an absolute joke for or more per person you get driven to a completely overcrowded beach etc but loungers and umbrellas are extra many employees and guests too are obviously seriously ill with flu or respiratory diseases there was coughing and snotting everywhere but it seems that only half of the people disinfect their hands mostly children dont at all but then they touch everything especially the cutlery racks so it doesnt matter no wonder i came back really sick and have been in bed for weeks you could also call it pirates of the caribbean
embarkation was poorly organized standing for hours sometimes in the cold ship far too full food was very good restaurant very very full
copenhagen is no longer a port the same food in the yacht club restaurant for days the chairs in the restaurants are sometimes very stained and not nice in the restaurants there is only something festive at christmas not enough for a christmas trip its all about selling
overall cruise ok there were some good things food route ship but also some bad things service condition of the ship cost transparency
we traveled with the aidanova from hamburg to oslo and back again three stops along the way we traveled with a sixmonthold baby to travel with a baby with aida you have to book by phone the trip with the ice to hamburg was flawless when we arrived at the terminal with the shuttle euros extra checkin took quite a long time you dont get preferential treatment with a small child like on a plane once we got on board everything was pretty confusing ok the ship quotnovaquot accommodates around guests and was fully booked when we arrived in the room unfortunately only one inside cabin was available we were very disappointed there was a travel cot in the room so there was no room for our own belongings we were told by phone that there should be a changing table but unfortunately there wasnt one ok so the room was unfortunately not great food the restaurants especially the buffet restaurants are completely overcrowded and far too cramped especially when serving food the selection over the days was unfortunately not particularly varied and the routes to the restaurants were very long ok the whole ship is very confusing and you spend the first few days looking for a table bars youre lucky if you get a seat and you wait forever for the drinks the selection of drinks is ok and the selection of bars is large but unfortunately there is still far too little space for the crowds pool far too small and completely overcrowded how can you have such a small pool area for so many guests elevators yes an extra point for the elevators on the ship there are a lot of them but even there you just wait staff very nice some speak german and the rest speak english wifi a disaster sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt costs extra of course euros for days for one device shuttle buses in copenhagen euros per person unfortunately because of a holiday they only ran until pm but thats understandable conclusion the aidanova is a huge ship with lots of restaurants bars a cinema evening entertainment pool area and much more unfortunately there is far too little space for so many people when the ship is fully booked you spend a lot of time waiting or getting from a to b you look in vain for a quiet corner aida charges extra for everything water bottles in the room cost you are not allowed to refill your water bottles however restaurants sometimes cost extra and drinks in some restaurants also cost extra despite having booked a drinks package cleanliness is ok
the ship is far too big the crew sometimes cannot meet expectations endless waiting times in the bars poor quality of the drinks why do you get the drinks for people spread over minutes why do you get a coffee without milk sugar and a spoon walking routes are illogical through the already narrow buffet area table reservations in the restaurant can only be made by phone at christmas this can mean or more attempts you have nothing else to do people in a person balcony cabin fit very well if you dont bring any luggage who actually came up with the idea of building a quottheatriumquot in the middle of the ship it had more the feel of a pedestrian zone but at least you could watch the dress rehearsal at midday because the theater cannot be separated as long as the technology doesnt fail there are so many little things that will make me book with the competition next time
waiting time for checkin was hours due to the weather situation not enough staff on the aida long waiting times to order drinks the food was very good and lovingly prepared the drinks when you got them were very tasty unfortunately the trip did not stop in copenhagen the cabins and the entire ship were very clean and tidy
apart from a few automatic announcements hygiene on board was nonexistent no one was standing in front of the restaurants to pay attention to them or in between as always with aida there were disinfectant dispensers everywhere but unfortunately they were rarely used the carpets and chairs were all stained for a ship that is years old and has not sailed for almost two years because of corona it is in poor condition there are far too few employees on board as a result the tables are not cleared quickly wipes were only wiped on request probably due to lack of time at the artbar we saw that the glasses were not cleared for over an hour even though the employees were always just walking the port of hamburg is not suitable for a ship of this size we left hours late and arrived hours early all because of wind and tidal range which meant that copenhagen had to be cancelled we only had kristansand extremely slippery and oslo christmas in the snow which was very nice in addition when we checked in we stood outside the terminal for almost three hours despite the time slot there was also nothing to drink or eat our suitcases were placed in front of the wrong cabin and we only found them using our airtags
motivated employees who enjoy their jobs wellmaintained schiff brauhaus great schnitzel and curry sausage buffalo steak house great quality and the best employees very attentive and helpful buffet restaurants also good quality room service great employees in room service very friendly and hardworking top suite with lots of extras that we didnt expect
up to date very well organized wide range of options restaurants bars excursions etc
horrible service rude staff aida blu get away from aida nothing works in the ship the welcoming was horrible no one helps you with the luggage and i had to take it myself to the cabin horrible food most of it frozen i have allergies non dairy gluten freeetc and i filled the form to inform before my ship then i spoke with the general manager on the ship and they dont carenothing improved all the music in german entertainmenttalks in german one staff shouted to me because i complained never happened to me something like that unrespectful people most of the germans leave the towel all day and they sit in the tiny jacuzzies for hours they dont care about other passengers i couldnt use the jacuzzi in days this is unacceptable aida is a scam they take your money and then there is no good service if you have a complaint they dont care they steal your money i give star because i cant do i paid more than for a solo cabin and i would ask my money back as i didnt get what i paid for if not i will take legal action against aida if it is necessary you are thieves aida you take the money of foreigners not german and you ignore them their whole trip making their holidays a nightmare shame on you in honour without prejudice a all rights reserved ucc update i received an email from them in which they dont take responsibility of these issues so no refund even i had credit to use on board for being a member and it hasnt been refunded to me
when i checked in i stood in line for hours i couldnt go to copenhagen so i had to go straight back to hamburg without any compensation outside of regular restaurant opening hours almost everything is closed the service staff tries hard but leaves a lot to be desired
very clean very good food nice spa area
value for money is pretty bad compared to other cruises we have been on staff very unfriendly especially in the restaurants quality of the food is really bad i have probably never had such bad food since the university cafeteria even in specialty restaurants the food is the same just served differently for almost euros per nightroom we expected a lot more the only thing that was nice was the route itself orient cruise and the rooms and ship were really super clean checkincheckout went smoothly
the food and animations were not good
unfriendly to small children the pool area is forbidden for people wearing diapers and the separate area for them is a bad joke flights with aida were a disaster and a huge mess on top of that there was a hour delay every time and pure chaos the food was very good but beware aida still wants money everywhere even with allinclusive and not just in some restaurants information about costs is not passed on or included in their info emails they just book and then they say they saw it on the menu they should have informed them but they ate it in the shop at the exit alcohol and red bull are free but you have to pay for water for children we were refused water refills for baby bottles in bars and we were told to order a glass of water but the best thing is still that you are lied to and then find out at the airport that everything is done by aida and they block the seats so that they have no influence at all and aida doesnt want to know anything about it top service
from start to finish it was the worst trip ive ever experienced checkin took over hours because of bad weather in hamburg aida could have thought of something here for example serving people a warm drink outside in the cold there was no real welcome on the ship the ship was only poorly decorated for christmas just a couple of fir trees in the theatrium the restaurants were not at all i had expected more maybe to be greeted with a glass of champagne from santa claus after all it was a quotchristmas tripquot the organization was just awful and the service was oh my god you can only order two drinks on your boarding pass and you wait an average of minutes for them terrible then in the restaurants every day there was a fight for free tables a disaster at the buffet restaurants the kitchen couldnt keep up with supplies little variety in the food always the same thing in the morning little variety at lunch and dinner either everything tasted ok but not really good theres still a lot of potential for improvement everywhere the entertainment was very good on days on the other days it was very boring like the circus nobody understood what it was about and the songs were boring too not much entertainment there was little entertainment for small children aged and the indoor pools are a joke i would describe this as a paddling pool rather than a swimming pool and if youre thinking oh she doesnt know what shes talking about but i do i also work in management and run a company and i know what im talking about
the trip from december nd to december th we saw the port of hamburg from december nd on december rd and on december th and on december th and on december th there has been no compensation to date unfortunately the food in the buffet restaurants was often only lukewarm
cruise in the mediademonstrated mass tourism and observation of the different social classes on a floating asian skyscraper
clean nice ship and friendly staff beautiful shows for cappuccino at breakfast or coffee at lunch of diner you have to pay extra and difficult to find your way on the ship long waiting time at reception sometimes but lovely activities and places to visit everything in german but they told that before
we had a nice holiday we werent impressed the threebed room with an extra baby bed suitcases and a buggy was a disaster please do not travel with babies under years old the baby bistro for monthold babies was not adequately equipped there was no puree no oatmeal and no childrens semolina hip jars for older children with pieces were available mashed potatoes were only available in the fuego if you asked for them but candy jars for children were filled to the brim three times three points are for entertainment food and decoration
great service very good food lots of options
relaxed atmosphere on the entire ship despite the approx passengers including numerous children
dear sir or madam i am one of the aida frequent travelers i know all ship classes and already traveled on the cosma in the summer first i would like to note something positive that has improved compared to the summer the hygiene concept has become a thousand times better regular disinfection is finally being observed again great after something positive comes something negative please please no more sundair i have never experienced a flight like this before it was absolute chaos the hand luggage was distributed throughout the aircraft by the flight attendants after landing the search began jackets and backpacks had disappeared had been swapped around or could not be found at all terrible on top of that it is possible to reserve seats aida had said this was not possible it is namely via the sundair website we booked comfort seats in advance unfortunately the seats were normal seats and that for euros i know that aida is not to blame for this i would just like to ask them to stop offering this airline to their passengers i also noticed that the staff on aidacosma are speaking more german again however on this trip in particular i noticed the staff even more with their shorts that showed their bottoms i am very sorry but in my opinion as a crew member this kind of clothing is inappropriate aida cruises should ensure that guests do not feel harassed by such revealing behavior after all it is still a familyfriendly ship isnt it in my opinion aida needs to communicate this again to all employees after all they represent the company my family and i felt very uncomfortable it was their first time sailing on aida and they were shocked by the crews behavior they told me that this behavior was prohibited by other shipping companies i was ashamed the crew also consumed a lot of alcohol at the quotpartiesquot i dont mind but some of the staff were very drunk and couldnt even walk straight terrible at that moment i thought about what it would be like if the general alarm went off how are drunk crew members supposed to help me in an emergency i thought that aida values the safety of its guests and that the guest comes first i would also like to point out that the quality of the excursions has improved again i was very pleased about that however i was shocked that drugs were consumed on the ship i am shocked that the safety regulations are only halfheartedly enforced i thought it was a family ship and not amsterdam another highlight of the trip was that someone spat on our prominent balcony from above we were always put off at reception after the fifth time our request was dealt with i dont call that relaxing i dont call the screaming child relaxing either the reception didnt take care of that either despite repeated attempts to address the issue the noise remained at a roaring level until the end of the holiday thank you for the sleepless nights it was definitely not relaxing i have already travelled on the cosma in the summer and can compare quite well in the summer i found the cosma impressive today i find it impersonal and exhausting the many families with very small children shout through the restaurants making it impossible to have a cosy dinner the restaurants are always fully booked and there is no variety in the buffet restaurants i was particularly annoyed by the hidden costs for example in the teppanyaki this is not holidayfriendly but rather a deterrent for future trips
unfortunately extremely unsatisfied waiting times for drinks were far too long the cabin and veranda were unfortunately not very clean repairs to the railing for example were made with makeshift tape and there was rust in many places the staff really tried hard but unfortunately there were far too few of them
the food and drink in the restaurants was good the staff was very good the offers were very good the waiting time at the bars was very long
unfriendly scouts and far too expensive excursions that are rushed through or start and end in chaos
christmas menu additional payment fell short of expectations potatoes dry and tasteless no sauceherb butter creme brule was a pudding with a sugar crust no themes in the buffet restaurants common on other aida ships
one week of severe feverish stomachintestinal illness despite reporting it no response from reception no help no support
super friendly staff super chefs great show great bars
arrival poor departure poor information and organization still satisfactory kitchen and catering staff good to very good
all information from rostock before the trip was unsatisfactory and sometimes bad checkin in hamburg despite my aida stated time hours waiting time we were also recommended to go into town again have something to eat and come back at pm after years of corona break we noticed that the quality of the food had noticeably declined this was also criticized by other guests some of whom were frequent travelers our st trip was the best our th trip the worst we reported many defects to aida in rostock and didnt even get a meaningful answer not even an apology its a shame we actually loved this way of traveling maybe they need a new travel tester then ill get in touch kind regards heidrun wolf
the quality of the excursions in terms of the descriptions and the price is in need of improvement the quality of the food is average just a canteen without any significant variation wifi is often unavailable the pool area is always completely full
an immediate solution for every problem despite guests on board
all dishes are super freshly prepared and delicious
the ship was in a generally mediocre condition every day onboard program and excursions was poorly organized the quality of the food and some of the staff in the onboard restaurants left a lot to be desired in general the prices were nowhere near commensurate with the quality offered
friendliness of the staff in the bar area quality of the food pool area poor rust on balconies and algae in the pool
there were always problems with the internet connection on board but that would be the only point to complain about the decisive factor for my star rating is the overall package on board everything is just right here starting with the food the shows the service and the cleanliness the activities on offer simply fantastic
checkin at the port terminal took an hour you sat on board all day without your suitcase the reception staff seemed completely uninformed and gave false information no separation between families and people without children the rooms were very noisy lots of hidden costs you even had to pay for films the personspace ratio was wrong all common areas were completely overcrowded bad internet and overpriced shortened trip with no apology or goodwill in direct comparison i liked all of this better on meinschiff
we went on our th cruise with aida of course there is always something that could be done better for example the waiters are unfortunately not as attentive and friendly as they used to be we often had to get up and go to them if we wanted coffee water or wine
st time as a thai on board aida asia cruise i gave aida the tip to take a look at their guest list in other words the food go for more asian food
poor organization excursions only partially or not at all carried out due to lack of time balcony only usable from the second day painting work and strong smell of paint
the aida cosma is an overcrowded ship where there is little to relax except in the spa area in the buffet restaurants the crowds push through the aisles and you only get a table after a long search there are not enough seats in the theater area the adult pool at the front is a joke and much too small the whirlpools are too cold the cabins are very thinly soundproof you can constantly hear the toilet flushing and can hardly sleep through it the smokers move the furniture on the balconies all day and the smoke gets into the cabin so that you go crazy and constantly have to open and close the balcony door a smoking area outside the cabin and not on the balcony is recommended children are constantly jumping from the bed to the floor in the cabins so that you are always stressed in addition there is no honest communication about illnesses on board so that we all got the spanishcanarian flu and that is times worse than corona you think youre dying and you cant move for days because of aching limbs or leave your cabin you cant eat anything and you have vomiting and diarrhea even incontinence according to the crew passengers were infected massages could not be cancelled due to illness it was better to let the staff get infected drinks for sick family members could only be taken from the restaurant with reluctance you should get a certificate from the ships doctor the excursions and the bars are too expensive for me a trip on the aida cosma is no longer an option you cant use any of the bars and restaurants in a week its a pure family ship
review i was in a cabin with a view it was clean and adequate for the holiday we saw a lot but unfortunately the stays in the ports were too short
unfortunately the largest ship was the most uncomfortable for me
the ship is in poor condition
great value for money always clean everyone is nice great selection best food i can only recommend it to everyone
we went on a cruise for days in the caribbean with the aidaperla not at all interesting if you are not german or german speaking everything on the ship is in german staff activities etc however they do advertise and selling cruises in belgiumthe netherlands so you expect at least english to be spoken forget it too busy on sea days no room on the pool deck which is far too small and people get up early especially to put down towels which they then leave all day long waiting times at the bar and the swimming pool is also half covered much too hot in the caribbean the buffet restaurants are far too busy the food is always the same and not hot but lukewarm to cold they probably do this expressly so that you eat in the restaurants that have to be paid for few seats for couples and seats are reserved against payment of a tip to the waiters seen with our own eyes never take excursions via aida itself to more expensive than just on shore and if you book an excursion via aida and there is an englishspeaking guide you expect this not experienced it myself and the guide spoke german i noticed that i had booked an englishspeaking excursion the comment was but everyone speaks german here and there you are it was a nice cruise in terms of the places we visited but on the ship you feel completely excluded if you are not german or german speaking so no more aida for us
nice cruise with minor flaws but that would be complaining at a high level
impersonal mass tourism without keeping booking promises given the above summary many readers are probably wondering what we expected from a cruise with over passengers on board admittedly there is a certain amount of overcrowding at peak times in every large hotel and also in tuis competitors but what aida quotoffersquot really defies any description whether its pm pm or pm the buffet restaurants are the scene of spectacular behavior patterns that people produce when there is not enough space the food is bad and mass processing is exaggerated to the point of perversion at the bars booking a drinks package is hardly worth it unless you pay a tip under the table or are happy to wait minutes or more for your order it can also take minutes to place an order the staff perform a studied ritual with the bartenders convincingly managing to skilfully ignore all the waiting guests and busy mixing drinks that were ordered minutes ago as i said money helps but this is less about tips and more about corruption because its about buying access to services that you paid for anyway you shouldnt be afraid of gastrointestinal viruses on board youll get them anyway and dont get upset if room service doesnt come after all it was there briefly at am allegedly but there was a quotdo not disturbquot sign one last tip please never under any circumstances dare to ask in a specialty restaurant whether you can reserve a table after all this has to be done before the trip and is also described in the app allegedly if you ask anyway you will be shouted at or sent away in a perfidious manner and told to come back at pm but then you will be told that the kitchen is already closing so never see aida again
you can save yourself the trip to dubai with aidaprima the authorities there are a real disaster the ship is also only mediocre long waiting times at the bars and for food a huge disappointment
aidaperla dishes always the same
requested solutions to tasks were not dealt with by the reception instead the customer was left alone the manager was only called in when insisted poor communication eg when making excursion adjustments checking out entertainment manager pales in comparison to denny schrder poor ventilation in the east restaurant after eating all of your clothes smell stink no further comment the cabin and service staff were very good however
service food and drinks information about the respective island a description of the ship would have been nice
my first and probably last cruise at least with aida quotyour dream vacation on aidanovaquot a welldeserved and absolutely necessary vacation for two to unwind at sea and see various metropolises that was the expectation above all the possibility of seeing various cities in just a few days made the trip particularly attractive in reality there was no sign of relaxation as the ship was extremely overcrowded for example in buffet restaurants you could only hope for a seat shortly before closing time or if you were lucky unless you were willing to wander through the restaurant several times and then quickly sit down at a table that had just become free and was usually dirty there were crowds and queues almost everywhere the best way to relax was to take a cocktail with you to your own cabin shore excursions also consisted of waiting to a considerable extent exploring on your own was a much better choice in comparison the service was not up to the mass of people for example many rooms were not even cleaned even with late checkin the announcement was that the room could still be entered for the safety briefing however we were eventually asked to leave the room during the safety briefing a bumpy start the unfavorable ratio of passengers to service staff was particularly evident in the buffet restaurants there was practically no service except shortly before closing time water and coffee were rarely or never brought instead specialty coffees were available from the machine for an extra charge in addition you looked in vain for salt and pepper although some dishes definitely needed them the two bottles of mineral water for the cabin which are included in the premium tariff were not provided there were queues in front of the reception around the clock some issues seemed to be able to be resolved via the app but ultimately we were referred to the reception many crew members including receptionists spoke little or no german and communicated with each other in their respective native languages the onboard language is not predominantly german unlike what aida says the aida app was only of limited use on board nautical information showed a static nautical chart the actual information was only visible outside the ship aidade was also only accessible outside the ship premium internet was overpriced and hardly usable even in the ports the connection was very weak due to approaching storms the stay in rotterdam was greatly shortened instead of staying overnight and then spending a day at sea quotrelaxation at seaquot the ship set sail in the afternoon and then spent a whole day in the port of hamburg with no compensation for the guests excursions in rotterdam were moved to the early hours of the morning and cancellation was not possible in case of doubt you were left with the costs ultimately the quality of the food was fine and the sea state at night enabled a good nights sleep but i can sleep at home too
on my last aida cruise coffee from the vending machine was free in the morning at breakfast salt and pepper were on the table now you had to ask for it every time at that time cake in the afternoon was still served in the buffet restaurant and the coffee was free today the cake is spread out over different bars which dont all have the same thing and you have to pay for the coffee the climbing park also costs money and is no longer free if you havent booked your trip in the most expensive category you have almost no chance of getting a specialty restaurant or other amenities like a baby monitor or topper as everything is fully booked at the bars you have to wait forever for your drink
beautiful ship good food great staff
far too many crowds of people and at the same time far too few service staff on board if you want to spend your vacation waiting this is the right place for you
the ship is hopelessly overcrowded all bars and restaurants are constantly full to bursting finding a seat is exhausting waiting forever to order at the bars the ordering process is laborious with a tablet and countersigning then waiting for minutes for the drinks themselves waiting for everything and everyone is standard on the aida no waiter actively comes to you there are cards lying around everywhere but no one serves you waiters avoid eye contact the app and online offering are a total joke the app is not userfriendly the app keeps switching back to the website no reservations possible via the app location and opening times of bars etc can only be found on different pages of the app confusing and exhausting constantly loud and choppy rehearsals in the theatrium no peace and quiet anywhere no relaxed atmosphere anywhere and the result of the hourslong rehearsals in the middle of the ship can only be seen again later in the evening at the actual performance the placement of the theater is absolutely suboptimal some bars are not occupied even though people want to order at the bars next door in supposedly quotmore upscalequot specialty restaurants that require reservations the main path for all guests leads straight through loud and uncomfortable and even in these fullservice restaurants there is a cheap canteen atmosphere so you sit with lobster tail and steak while strollers are pushed past cm away from you the walkways and layout of the decks are confusing sometimes you have to change sides to get to the bow or stern lots of dead ends and detours waiters clink and rattle cutlery in the middle of the dining tables as these cutlery stations are pointlessly placed right between the tables there is no pepper and salt anywhere on the table you have to wait until you see a waiter who brings it to you on request as aida is afraid the mills might be stolen so you can only season quotcoldquot food children are everywhere there are no adult areas to relax everything is loud and exhausting there are strollers everywhere in the corridors and at the exit announcements come too often one after the other with often redundant information and sometimes start as early as am in all corridors and in the cabins no chance of sleeping in no shots or spirits available even with the quotallinclusivequot drinks package the drinks selection is onesided and the same everywhere tiny lunch menu in the quotbrauhausquot chicken constantly sold out the homebrewed beer is of course subject to an additional charge and is not even included in the quotallinclusivequot shuttle buses can only be booked at reception the line at reception is always overcrowded with up to minutes waiting time the hotline to reception only refers you back to reception in person queuing is apparently encouraged guests are forced to eat only in the overcrowded and designated seating areas even quottogo sandwichesquot can only be consumed on site how schizophrenic is that as food is not allowed in any bars in the bars on the other hand there are no snacks or nibbles conclusion cheap and overcrowded family barge with no quality standards aida never again
the care provided by the staff on the ship and during the excursions was very good
wonderful caribbean trip we saw and experienced a lot unfortunately the priceperformance ratio of the excursions through aida was too expensive but it was well organized at the port you can get the excursions through thirdparty providers for a third of the price the aida luna is getting quite old our cabin creaked so loudly that you thought it was about to fall apart weve never had that on the other aida ships but the cabin was always spotlessly clean the food was very good again the service in the restaurant was mostly unfriendly except for a few who tried very hard at the pool bar there was a waiter who was probably the boss with a small pigtail he was so unfriendly and cheeky we actually wanted to complain at reception but because the bar crew from the ocean bar were so great we let it go big compliments to minngus and vipin and all the other crew big compliments to the bar crew from the anytime bar too the entertainment in the theater was also great the animation team on the other hand still has a lot to learn they didnt really approach people the games were rather boring big praise also to our tour guide keyleen i dont know if i spelled the name correctly but the excursions with her were really fun despite everything it was a really great trip what isnt nice is that the sauna is no longer included in the really high price of the trip that really bothered us we can still recommend the trip
the aida luna is unfortunately getting on in years the german staff reception and excursion sales were not particularly motivated unfortunately there was also a lack of employees on board the deck pool was not filled with water and that on a caribbean cruise numerous pieces of equipment had a quotweak momentquot as they so beautifully put it the aida excursions were overpriced and not of high quality quantity instead of quality the food selection in the buffet restaurants was ok but not particularly outstanding there was not always something to eat for kindergarten children a real shame for a family ship and how can you possibly organize a themed lunch on the pool deck the day before the journey home which is called quotbread and sandwichquot the entertainment program was less than average where are the aida stars on the days a week when they dont have a performance only the kids club was remarkably great thank you arlina amelie annamaria and louisa
i liked the market restaurant and burgers the best and there was also the beach bar
permanent advertising event and totally unrealistic price expectations no free water and poor entertainment concept insufficient cash reserves for nonalcoholic connoisseurs there is little positive to report
what a shame good food very friendly staff very bad ordering system at the bars like at the hamburg fish market your name is shouted when its time to pick up your drinks
sometimes up to small children in the lounge for suite guests does not allow for peace and relaxation
caribbean cruise lesser antilles with aidaperla november th december th a nice interesting and varied cruise at reasonable prices on a moderately comfortable ship aidaperla has quite a few restaurants with a reasonable selection x buffet restaurant italian eastern brewery which are overall quite nicely decorated no quottrain station hallsquot the variety of the included food is good the quality of the food in the free buffet restaurants is ok but unfortunately there is bad miserable inedible wine included with it aldi would be ashamed to sell such booze for one euro per liter bottle and as a welcome drink or on the evening before disembarkation there is not even a simple sparkling wine but quoteuropean community sparkling wine with added carbon dioxidequot bottled in the cheapest bottles true to the motto quotthe cheapest of the cheap is just good enough for our aida customersquot the additional paid options wine list in the buffet and some specialty restaurants are extremely poor and these wines are nothing special either you can also order other sometimes quite reasonable wines from the waiter but they are not on the wine list and this is apparently only known to insiders in the buffet restaurants there are sometimes staff who speak neither german nor english there are quotsoftboiledquot eggs for breakfast but no egg cups there is neither a coffee machine in the cabins nor the option of having breakfast brought to your room in the morning on early shore excursions as is sometimes the case with other cruise lines there is no turndown service in the evenings and therefore no quotmattress animalsquot small amenities and attentions such as the quotschnapps taxiquot on mein schiff are completely missing the shows are relatively short maximum to minutes and not as elaborate or good as on other more expensive ships but sometimes quite ok however the quotartistquot kevin came to one of his shows not a rehearsal in a tracksuit and said that was a good idea an impertinence towards the audience the internet rates are about four times as expensive as on mein schiff for example on other good ships a lecturer gives interesting insights into the next excursion destinations and tips for going ashore to get to know the country and its people instead on aida only presentations and advertising for the next aida tours shore excursions the hospitaldoctor is only open four hours a day am to am and pm to pm ie during shore excursions beyond that only emergencies are treated there was hardly a barrierfree view on the entire ship when entering and leaving port either everything is cordoned off or meterhigh glass panels restrict photography even on the sun decks it was only after a long search that i found a hidden spot at the bow this also meant that the departure parties that are so popular on other ships were no longer possible conclusion despite this the entire trip and basically the ship too was okay all the comfort and amenities that i missed on aidaperla are partially made better on mein schiff and significantly better on norwegian cruise lines but i am paying more for this trip on mein schiff and to more on ncl the priceperformance ratio was therefore okay overall and if i had known all this beforehand i would do this trip again at this price to the caribbean despite the defects on the ship mentioned
the ship was always clean and the staff very friendly
cleanliness restaurants restaurant opening hours
aida has overoptimized itself with the aidacosma it is not enough to add a few decks if no more space is created otherwise it was always crowded and loud everywhere even though the ship was not even fully occupied with around passengers at the bars you had to wait to minutes for a cocktail the queues in the buffet restaurants were long and not just at the beginning of opening hours there was no peace and quiet on the outside decks until pm but by then all the chairs and deckchairs had unfortunately been packed away so that those seeking peace and quiet who just wanted to read had no opportunity to do so we were extremely disappointed and frustrated we found the food in the restaurants boring we had expected to find italian dishes in bella donna spanish ideas in fuego east asian dishes in the yacht restaurant and a good selection of fish dishes in the yacht restaurant however we had the impression that the offerings in all buffet restaurants were the same apart from minimal additional offerings we were not informed that it was necessary to book the specialty restaurants in advance when we found out by chance it was too late we were supposed to try it on board but we had no luck with a booking there either we then learned that it is common to make many double bookings for the same day and sometimes for several specialty restaurants because you dont know in advance what time slot you will be back for we find it extremely frustrating that the aida booking system does not prevent this we had booked the aida light drinks package and then discovered that the morning cappuccino is only available in two buffet restaurants at the bars it is only available from am and the cappuccino in the starbucks bar is not included in the price at coffee time you can easily wait in line for minutes for your coffee specialty nonalcoholic beer was not included in the price even though the package is advertised as a nonalcoholic drinks package it wasnt worth the euros per person for the week because of the endless waiting times at all the bars we would have also liked to use the sports program but who wants to take part in water aerobics at am or be back from a shore excursion at pm for back exercises one positive thing to note and thats why we gave it two stars instead of one is the cleanliness of the ship the friendliness of the staff and the comfort of the cabin we really liked our veranda cabin
good organization and support in all areas very extensive and varied provision everything is done to ensure the guests satisfaction
experienced extremely unpleasant things on board
good layout of the cabin nice view of deck good food very friendly service staff we were always well informed thanks to the captains announcements the docking and departure times were always adhered to once the ship had to return to the departure port due to a medical emergency however this was communicated immediately by the captain and everyone understood
the crew does a good job and really tries hard the reception has too much to do
aida had booked the return journey for us through the bad marabu airline since checkin took over an hour three toilets on the plane were unusable and there was a long queue in the aisle during the flight the flight was very unpleasant and turbulent there was also no food to buy the return journey was therefore very unpleasant and i cannot give it five points on board the aida and the outward journey were very organized and relaxed however
the restaurant occupancy far too full and crowded and the elevator situation too long waiting times from the upper and lower decks urgently need to be improved and the excursions should also be organized a little better and with more care
a lot of things went wrong on our trip but the worst thing was the lack of hygiene on the ship we immediately caught a stomach bug and half of our vacation was ruined
cleanliness is declining restaurants close at pm so that guests can go to bed and dont cost anything once you leave the ship you are left alone even though the return flight is booked through aida no information that the flight is hours later no water or anything else in the building at degrees
the concept with the different restaurants without fixed times and also different styles italian french steak house asian brewery also the atmosphere in the brewery sometimes like oktoberfest show blocks in the evening were always good to very good in quality good presentations about next destinations and ports especially from ms mnchenhagen specialist for the middle eastarabia
was a very nice holiday beautiful ship great food good priceperformance ratio
unfortunately after cruises one has to say that compared to mein schiff aida reaches its limits when the large ships are fully booked and the quality is constantly declining just a few key words ordering drinks in the bars via the staffs cell phones is a disaster very high prices for additional services advertised a la carte restaurants can no longer be booked months before the trip hygiene principles are not consistently and consistently adhered to of our group of people fell ill during and after the trip of course no shipping company can do anything about the behavior of the guests but this time it was extremely abysmal conclusion its better to pay a little more and at least get some of the cruise feeling shame on aida
idablu is a medium sized ship of aida cruises the cruise i am writing this review on is a day cruise from antalya to mauritius the ship is well maintained but has flaws here and there you have to be on time in the three self service restaurants as refills are minimal the cheese section in the market amp bella donna is certainly not adequate and mostly completely trashed after half an hour little variety in the dishes although there is a different theme every day even the desserts including fruit are not that great the same boring ice cream flavors every day best burger sea is completely bad and the staff is very unfriendly the pools on the pool deck are minimal and not really clean sun loungers sag as much as the chairs the beach towel service is a big farce take a stack to your cabin on the first day so you have at least some in stock after a few days of cruising this service is greatly reduced to about towels a few times a day and you are informed that you have to use the same towel for several days because the environment if you care about the environment then stay home and go on a cycling holiday the cabins themselves are fine however they are cleaned at least once a day you have to beg for new soapfresh shower the dispensers are only refilled with some soap the shower smells of urine if you want a slightly more spacious cabin look for a person cabin with folding beds then you have more square meters and more closet space the aida stars of the evening entertainment are good but thats all the animation team is so bad that for a proper workout it would have been better to stay in germany the games are of such a low standard and so garishly presented that you just want to throw these children overboard one by one the excursions are as on most cruise ships way overpriced the internet is reasonably fast and works without any problems the price is debatable i dont think a drinks package is really recommended as the choice is not really big and the ship is not really nicely decorated to have fun and for lunch and dinner you can drink unlimited beer and wine its a pity that there are so many small screaming children on board in my opinion the ship is not suitable for small children there is a kids club but it is only open a few hours a day not like other cruise companies that are suitable for children but aidablu is not the staff you deal with is super nice and helpful in contrast the officials have such a mien and arrogance that it is almost embarrassing what also disappointed us is that no transport from the boat to the airport was organized overall rating
the food is really good everywhere except for a few small exceptions in the east the squid rings were like rubber
overall it could be much better especially the situation in the restaurants and at the elevators is an absolute nuisance it almost seems as if the concept is to drive people through the overcrowded buffet restaurants into the specialty temples which have to be paid for we were also affected by the rampant gastrointestinal virus like very very many others the excursions we booked were actually nothing relatively unloving sometimes even double eg oslo in the evening and oslo compact and you are rushed through the cities and locations under a lot of time pressure why actually but i also dont understand how you can book a cruise like this with so many small children and especially babies ultimately neither the parents nor the children benefit from it however the food in the steak restaurant and the performances in tv studio x and to a lesser extent the show in the time machine were good and the drinks package we booked was also quite useful
very good management on the aidanova this is also reflected in the satisfaction of the employees who enjoy doing their difficult job and smile while doing it we didnt see anyone who was dissatisfied if only all ships had such management
if you want to go on a cruise without feeling like youre on a cruise aida is the right choice the battle at the buffet could just as easily take place in any cheap hotel in mallorca cutlery stands on the tables that are a perfect breeding ground for germs all the hand disinfection is useless once a number of childrens hands have fumbled around in the stands there were more and more sick people on board lukewarm food industrial goods the quotfeedingquot concept is illconceived the food is at canteen level no salt and pepper at the table constantly changing opening times no restaurant open all the time because there are hardly any tables for two about half of all the seating chairs is lost if only two people are at the table people who besiege the seats by the window from morning to night overwhelmed staff quotpremium internetquot that hardly works an app that is completely illogical and has no links you constantly have to log in again allinclusive and yet you constantly have to check the menu to see if the drink you want is really free free ice cream at the buffet per scoop in the ice cream parlor ripoff free cake coffee costs ripoff constant technical problems the tv didnt work for two days no information whatsoever about how to get into town from the port or whether there was a shuttle there wasnt the crowd took some getting used to small children were dragged along by their parents until late at night there are no limits for the little ones the concept doesnt offer a cruise experience but anyone who loves ballermann will be in good hands with aida for us once and never again
we spent a week in the canaries and all in all it was a lovely holiday the ship was beautiful modern and very well maintained and the food was very good and varied unfortunately the details were not as expected firstly an quotall inclusivequot package is offered but it is not one you have to constantly look at the maps to see what is marked with dots to see what might not be included which applies to bottled water for example in addition the app or onboard portal is not very well developed some things are simply not displayed or cannot be booked eg spasauna appointments and you often jump back and forth between the app and the portal and have to register again and overall aida is unfortunately no longer the quotclub shipquot it used to be the whole thing is quite anonymous and for us had little of the club feel that you would expect from club hotels
unfortunately the standard has dropped significantly overall the nova was full of families and sick people according to one employee there were over people with a gastrointestinal infection there were also a number of people who tested positive the rooms were not cleaned properly due to the effort required by sick people etc people in sweatpants some of them drunk sit at the tables during meals and the guests also behave badly some employees were rude to passengers and information was withheld we are considering going on my ship after all
please do not book cabin on the nova kitchen above and high noise level
last year we travelled with aida perla now with aida prima aida prima cannot be compared with aida perla or has the service deteriorated now with aida prima the restaurants are dirty tables not tidied we ate quoton dirty platesquot water and wine were forgotten the service was very unfriendly reception overcrowded answers depending on the mood we were very very disappointed with the service on the ship cleaning and cleanliness very good information about excursions inadequate and in general it was just unfriendly poor service and the flights aida takes money for flights and then assigns seats at random we couldnt sit together even though we planned and booked everything months in advance we had no expectations back or front it doesnt matter but we are travelling together and we want to travel together for these hours my daughter rows away from her children and years old you have to imagine it small children should sit alone only aida can do that other passengers paid euros per person to get the seats together but nothing happened we asked at emirates airport and they confirmed that this is aidas policy they dont care its just fraud they also promise that we dont have to worry about the suitcases but when we arrived my husbands suitcase arrived in the evening we spent the whole day booked and paid for excursions without clothes in front of my daughter the same thing in the bar plaza the barman simply refused to offer us a drink he didnt feel like serving in the restaurants especially bella donna and east the customers were really unpleasant and inconvenient the food was very good but eating out not pleasant it was simply loveless inferior not accommodating we are not at all satisfied we had a completely different experience last year captain becker we have great respect for him and the whole team at perla last year this year not recommended
no germanspeaking guided excursions panama was cancelled without replacement got very ill from an included drink that probably contained coliform bacteria had to go to the hospital never again
entertainment food
ship aidaprima is too big too few outdoor areas in the restaurants no pool deck no real pool cycling course rather poor
the hygiene concept if one exists at all is abysmal there is dirt everywhere on board toilets are broken or very dirty noro virus spreads easily on board sorry but that was the last aida trip
problems at checkin are standard problems on board are not solved despite three attempts at reception everywhere on board is full logistically poorly managed especially on days at sea the highlight is when a buffet restaurant is closed on a day at sea because of an internal event party forget it unfortunately nobody dances bar tables are on the dance floor theater shows disaster
everything was just perfect the aidastella is a very beautiful ship the crew is super friendly and makes an incredible effort to make you feel comfortable the food is varied and really delicious there are great artists to see in the evening the bars on board are highly recommended the cocktails are great there is not a single point that we can criticize a big thank you to all the crew members we will book again
quality significantly reduced compared to food like in the canteen coffee from the machine only for an additional charge or in the ai package cost of drinks disproportionately expensive
arrival with condor was bad cheap flight food on the ship was sometimes inedible and too salty even the soups steaks fries pasta were lukewarm to cold few vegetables fruit insufficient bananas not there mango rarely then mushy or not ripe pineapple when there is one turned brown ice cream sometimes pure chemicals nonalcoholic beer not there no variety organization bad excursions overpriced water too expensive ports ugly and far away from cities staff incompetent to childishly bitchy captain incomprehensible information incomplete air conditioning too cold then warm then cold sweater necessary organization bad full stairwells when going ashore ship very late clearances by authorities a lot of time lost for excursions over the last days more and more people have been sick with corona and colds the air conditioning contributed to this and cost a lot of energy now i dont like it any more at least not aida for the time being
relaxing trip friendly staff and good quality food
very friendly staff large selection of food and very good quality good cabin size
weeks in the caribbean balcony cabin including flight aida diva the visual condition of the ship is questionable there is rust everywhere upholstered furniture in the room is quotfilthyquot the ceiling panels are missing in several places outside our wooden railing on the balcony hasnt seen any paint in years the wood is totally brittle the quality of the cocktails is abysmal no decoration fruit etc on the cocktail glass no orange just lemon for the aperol spritz steak house food is top notch service is totally understaffed the food comes even though there arent even any drinks on the table buffet restaurants are ok throughout but the worst are the ladies and gentlemen in white who act to control and encourage the service staff none of them has a smile on their face for even a second you get the impression that you are in modern slavery the crowning glory is the team at reception as the first point of contact for every guest they should reflect the quality of the hotelship however the ladies are more annoyed with their job than i have ever seen before every question is one question too many this was my th trip with aida i dont know if its this bad on all ships and shipping companies however i wont want to spend so much money again on such a bad vacation there are much better options
a perfect trip very good food cleanliness
it was my first cruise booking for my birthday and to find out what the cruise experience is like advice on booking was not compliant i paid the full price for a sweet drinks package and internet did not receive what i was promised and was constantly tried to pay more i have no idea how much space there is here to write perhaps there would be a small paperback the bottom line is that i would recommend the following to anyone who books aida wait for a bargain and book then the additional costs on the ship are lucrative but those who pay the full price will be ripped off again anyway the food was massproduced and not really tasty on average sorry for writing so negatively to put the numbers on the table i paid around eur for days that was not worth the service and promise an example i was advised over the phone to book a sweet for maximum service then i even get breakfast in my room i booked it as a stranger i get on the ship and ask how it works with breakfast in the room no they are different sweets not the ones i booked thank you very much aida advice the highly praised hygiene concept gave me a gastrointestinal infection on the last day without any extra charge ill stop now from the point of view of a moneymilking machine aida is brilliant they know how the rabble works and how to rip people off theres a reason why there are ships like this but its not my style if ive ever booked an allinclusive package then thats how it was but thats not the case with aida and the masses work in such a way that a tempting offer leads to the ship and then they just spend even more money so bottom line please never pay full price but wait for offers and bargains youll end up paying more anyway
the crew was very courteous in all areas the ship was clean and the food and drinks were good arrival and departure were very well organized the excursions were a bit expensive but well organized
very good facilities on the ship very clean super friendly staff good food
i had my second trip with aida in november the first trip was with the cosma to the orient this trip was flawless and just fantastic in november i was in the caribbean with the luna first of all i remain loyal to aida and am a fan however there were small things that need to be mentioned and should also be improved with the prices in two weeks the luna didnt even manage to turn the departure music up to goosebump volume you almost needed hearing aids to hear anything at all a real shame the cosma did this sensationally in every port i also had the impression that the drinks menu is shrinking and the cocktails really need improvement lots of alcohol in them hardly any additives no limes mint or fruit for the price of the trip that should be included unfortunately the staff at reception on the luna were unprofessional and very unfriendly two ports were cancelled on this trip unfortunately the communication by the captain was very inappropriate and showed zero compassion for the passengers and their anger
clean ship with good food too expensive for the route which was changed twice and mainly called at ports in the mediterranean
perla caribbean ship clean restaurants not completely overcrowded cabin junior suite with corresponding amenities was good service mostly ok food in the buffet restaurants is equivalent to ikea gastronomy with a larger selection fuego was better ala carte restaurants were good i didnt like the entertainment singing was stupid costumes were stupid choreography was uninspired and cheap unfortunately the crosssection of guests on board was not that great for every nice and sophisticated people there were stupid people some of the ports were chosen so cheaply that the holiday experience suffered eg departure from la romana thats just not acceptable the airline chosen by aida discover can only be described as a joke in business class broken seats no lounge no bc transfer flight luggage was lost was delayed by days transfer required new security checks plane was in the last outside position at the airport the main thing is that it was cheap conclusion as a suite guest you have access to the aida lounge which is nice but thats about it for euros people you definitely dont get enough in return
we were very satisfied only in the market restaurant did the menu hardly change almost always the same dishes it was better at aida exactly the same dishes times a week far too little variety
very friendly service and housekeeping staff great entertainment boring and repetitive food dress code for dinner is not consistently enforced
our aida trip did not meet my expectations this time here are just a few points for my decision a services are getting worse and prices are rising b staff especially at the bars are quite unfriendly with the exception of a few waiters and waitresses in the restaurants c djs are sometimes overwhelmed and rarely respond to music requests d cake is offered at lunchtime coffee has to be paid for this was not the case on my last trips unbelievable e after the first week there were apparently no limeslemons for the beer drinks corana salitos etc after asking several times it was ok f the dress code at dinner is not checked and therefore not adhered to by the passengers g for a germanspeaking ship there is very little staff who speaks german except for the managers h shore excursions are overpriced and are sometimes carried out by local providers these are many times cheaper if booked directly on site i the ship is a bit older and therefore more prone to repairs toilet facilities on deck have a very strong smell j black seals on the pool deck and on the pool mushrooms are discoloring be careful with evening wear shirt now has black stripes k the selection in the buffet restaurants is large at first but can change over the course of the evening the food is mostly warm but not hot the quality of the meat has been better in recent years i internet problems despite paid social media flat rate at a few access points and on the tv in the room in conclusion i can only say that i used to be positively surprised with aida and now unfortunately i am negatively surprised almost every day on the whole however we liked the route and the selection of ports abc islands caribbean quite well
few activities for children that are not available for a fee family play time in a room with a ship no toys the food staff and some of the entertainment were good
unfortunately the sentence quoteverything used to be betterquot is nothing but the truth costcutting dealing with staff working hours law quality of food in restaurants keeping the ship in good shape
great ship with lots of options everything is possible nothing is necessary great facilities the quality and variety of the food is excellent unfortunately there are long waiting times for drinks and the service staff have a poor knowledge of german and english
after we had a rather disappointing experience on the aidabella to norway in april this year completely overcrowded constant queuing and waiting our last cruise novdec was again a complete success here is our rough summary travelling as a couple under food and quality in all restaurants visited excellent all public areas very clean and tidy daily changing entertainment the drag queen program was particularly good crowds were well distributed even on sea days ports and shore excursions very nice booked aida excursion biking tour on lanzarote top hospitable and hardworking staff concierge very courteous and helpful suites lounge left nothing to be desired ambience and atmosphere on the ship very appealing to us relaxed and informal spa area and use very satisfactory enough opportunities for distinction even if you visit the restaurants countercyclically it sometimes takes a while to find a table although this is within reasonable limits on the flagship cosma the motto quotcruises for everyonequot is often evident in the behavior of some fellow travelers eg an older gentleman repeatedly banged loudly on a pot at the buffet with a pair of tongs so that the kitchen staff would supposedly refill the food more quickly handbags get their own seat in the theater people complain about food that is too cold but forget that they spent at least minutes wandering around the buffet with their plates conclusion after the th cruise with aida drink packages are and remain uninteresting for us cabins with access to the suite lounge are preferred do not travel during school holidays travel with prima perla cosma or nova is better individual arrival and departure by plane in business class is only slightly more expensive than the aida flight package in economy class
good arrivaldeparture organization quality of food cabins bad service at the bars service in the buffet restaurants design of the ship particularly the walkways through the restaurant areas
the priceperformance ratio at aida is good excellently trained staff the ships facilities are optimal there is certainly room for improvement for example variety in the food visiting different destinations
everything was perfect from the service to the arrival and departure excursions food and even the weather was great
had a great trip with the aida nova initially i thought the ship would be too big but the guests are perfectly distributed on the ship all a la carte restaurants are simply top notch and very tasty
very well organized cruise including arrival and departure the only drawback is the lack of variety in the menu on a day trip in the buffet restaurants
a ship that was completely understaffed and at the same time overcrowded poor quality food overwhelmed and sometimes unfriendly staff queues at the reception the bars in the buffet restaurants loud and chaotic
i am very disappointed with the trip with aida nova the food in all the restaurants was canteen food the cocktails in the evening were very poor the staff were all filipinos for cost reasons people were too full queuing for up to an hour for something to eat made me feel like i was trapped in a shopping center i never want to put myself through that again in a mediterranean restaurant the airdried italian hams that were only hung up for decoration were particularly impressive and the visitors only got to eat the cheap german industrial ham i would replace the entire management of the aida group because whoever is responsible for something like that is doing it with gross negligence and needs to be fired
poor organization of shore excursions excursions overpriced beautiful ship very good crew
unfortunately once again a very very large ship that was fully booked but ok at reception we were given incorrect information about the casino payout and that almost cost us our winnings which you have to cash out in the casino and not as the lady said automatically deducted unfortunately the bingo machine turns off after numbers which cost us our winnings as our ball was in it and then fell we thought studio x was stupid its better in the theater the sausage is still very poor quality and tasteless multiple changes to the routes and especially the arrival and departure times we just about made the train on the way back unfortunately the kebab is piled up so that the sauce is on top and then you have to eat it in layers instead of one bite and everything is in unfortunately the shows are getting more and more boring and unspectacular well for us no more big aida ships and its always the same thing you get kicked out on the last day even if the ship isnt even there you have to leave the room what a shame and the art objects are always overpriced unfortunately oh well
great ship with the best cuisine and top organization very friendly staff
everything was great a nice big ship food was good drinks were good
aidacosma is much too big you get the impression that aidas main focus is on filling the ship and that they dont really care about the passengers buffet restaurants are a disaster other restaurants are always fully booked and its horrible to always have to arrive in port with almost passengers okay we should have known that beforehand
aida should pay a little more attention to etiquette and clothing at mealtimes
very nice ship with lots of things to do lots of delicious restaurants the silent party is always great
food rest and organization
we have just completed our first cruise and will definitely go on another cruise but not with aida the communication on board was so bad that for us and many other guests it had nothing to do with a vacation but was just stress if you ask the staff why this is the case and even make a suggestion for improvement they react unfriendly and simply send you away the opening times of the buffet restaurants are constantly changing
once aida always aida i heard this saying for the first time years ago and its true it feels like coming home super friendly staff great food great acquaintances
service in the restaurants was good longer waiting times at the bars
the staff rooms market restaurant was uniquely good and always friendly
despite contacting reception several times a security defect was not remedied from the third day of the trip the upper fastening screw on the hinge of the bathroom door was missing so that the door hung loosely in the entrance and came towards us once fortunately nothing happened the defect was not remedied by the end of the trip
its really abysmal we booked all inclusive and this is the second time we havent been allowed any alcohol on board its not about drinking and i want to stress that explicitly youre just paying for a service you dont get the bar manager then called me and tried to explain it to me and said that there was nothing he could do about it and that i should just accept it i have rarely experienced such unfriendly behavior i then told him that we had already taken the same route with mein schiff and that it had never happened before he said that i had to decide for myself which ship i wanted to travel on that is simply impossible
high prices for suites but only one real suite offer lounge but nice always loud always noise no peace anywhere either something is humming or the staff is making noise suites at the stern are bombarded with bass from the lanai bar in the morning problems or defects always have to be reported first unfortunately nothing often happens on its own theatrium was disrupted several times shows were cancelled as a result the singer of the band dafunk unfortunately cannot sing the singer suffered a fit of rage in front of guests the food in the steakhouse was great the staff are really friendly they even have caribbean beer the bartenders can just tap beer the cocktails were great too although the ship was fully booked we always got a table in all the restaurants we went to sometimes very strange with guests who for example shoveled tupperware containers full of food or got drinks from the drinks machine with their dirty sports bottles unfortunately our sweet was already quite worn tarnished mirrors or ladders in the upholstery soap dispenser very worn in the first week there were unfortunately no flowers there is no more moet champagne as a welcome something else the hygiene concept urgently needs to be better enforced unfortunately the majority of people on the ship were sick there was no control anywhere to make sure people were washing or disinfecting their hands in the onboard hospital you are advised to forego a corona test because otherwise you have to go into quarantine and you can get through it with paracetamol therefore a lot of sick people will have continued to walk around the ship sick simply out of fear of quarantine the return flight was crap in la romana they were dropped off at an airport that was far too small for hours a beer costs there and the staff there speaks almost no english the flight itself was ok but the luggage didnt make it to the destination airport
when comparing different services other providers are significantly more expensive sometimes very unusual and friendly staff especially in the restaurant shore excursions are not of high quality
quality has declined significantly condition of the ship staff overwhelmed
the trip to samana was not okay
singapore was supposed to be our highlight and turned out to be a disappointment the excursion we had booked didnt take place and due to inadequate communication from the crew and our tour guide we were only able to explore singapore in the evening the day was lost other excursions offered by aida were overpriced and the quality did not match the service in general you had the impression that as a holidaymaker and guest you were not the focus of attention but were just being taken advantage of accepting criticism was not the crews strong suit the health of the passengers was not taken into account enough either it was far too cold on the ship and the service staff were not always hygienic the food was often lukewarm the wine we requested had run out and drinks were often only brought after the meal water in the room had to be paid for extra despite the overpriced drinks package excursions were often with englishspeaking tour guides whose english was difficult to understand older passengers didnt get anything at all what was promised before the excursion was not kept
super friendly good food good service
if you point out that the whirlpool is very cold and the receptionist tells you that it is not a bathtub i think that is simply inappropriate i would say that everyone would expect at least body temperature if the fifth coffee pot you order doesnt make it to the table tomorrow for me it has nothing to do with service my conclusion my first and last cruise
the aida cosmar is a new ship that offers a wide range of la carte restaurants in addition to budget restaurants one very negative aspect is that the seats in the la carte restaurants are allocated on a firstcome firstserved basis and unfortunately most of them are already booked before the trip begins regardless of what has been said the journey from dsseldorf to mallorca with sundair was a nightmare because the distance between the seats was far too small even for normalsized travelers
had a great week on the aida nova good food and a great selection of bars and restaurants will be back many thanks to the whole team
great experience great staff and the food was really good and plentiful
we were traveling with aidaluna in the caribbean the staff in the bars cabins and reception were very nice unfortunately the food and drinks in the buffet restaurants were anything but good warm is more accurate unfortunately any deficiencies communicated to the responsible restaurant manager were not taken seriously and were either fixed or a solution was found the a la carte restaurants on the other hand were great the excursions on the other hand were mega at least that was our experience with aida so far
everything was great praise to the crew and ship nothing to complain about
guests are constantly walking to the buffet in restaurants with their used dishes and glasses restaurants where tables have to be reserved cannot be used for the entire trip as reservations cannot be made before the trip and cannot be made at the start of the trip either
too many people on board buffet restaurants were like battlefields no real pools
i experienced a wrecked old ship torn upholstery gnawed tables stained carpets one excursion was in the opinion of all the guests on the bus abysmal as a guest you feel like a squeezed lemon the priceperformance ratio is no longer right at all
service and friendliness very pronounced what we didnt like crowds in the restaurants as guests remain seated the entire opening time use of the drinks station by guests to fill bottles very unhygienic luggage chaos when leaving
punctuality environmentally friendly
this was our fourth and probably last trip with aida the priceperformance ratio is hardly right here we traveled with my mum years old and had booked a suite so that we had two rooms when we arrived in the suite it smelled so strongly of drains that you almost had to we thought it was maybe because of the port the toilets had just been pumped out or something when we went to the toilet the flush only worked on a whim we told reception but nothing happened to do our business we had to find a toilet on the ship which was for my mum at years old youre happy to do that because you dont want any more smells in the bathroom and the flush doesnt work the next day the same problem again to reception well take care of it it worked fine for day then the same thing again at reception they laughed at it saying theyre too stupid but if the flush doesnt work after presses something must be broken it can happen but then you can say so the connecting door in the suite was a sliding door which we had to stabilize on both sides with the stool because it just rattled and creaked and you couldnt get a wink of sleep la palma it rained nonstop or rather it poured no problem nobody can do anything about the weather but when you call reception and ask if they have umbrellas to borrow and you are told quotno but you can buy a poncho for quot as an answer its pretty cheeky when theres an umbrella in the closet in the living room of the suite we didnt know this because my mum uses this closet when we left we thanked them for not pointing it out to us the answer was that they can look for themselves true but if you ask you can point it out on the day of departure as a suite guest you have until am to stay in the suite which is stupid if you cant get back in by am there was a smoking area on the pool deck that was under cover at the door to the stairwell we had to go through it every time to get to the outside area because my mum is not very good on her feet it was more than unpleasant for a nonsmoker and the smoke also went into the stairwell which i personally dont like there are enough free places in the fresh air where you can smoke various drinks were not available at all or were deliberately left out to save money i dont know all small things but they added up its a shame that it was just laughed at and you were labelled as stupid because the trip cost a lot of money
even with money you only get bad mediocre food on aida paint is peeling off tables in some restaurants are dirty service and amenities only when you ask for it at the bars you sometimes wait minutes for a drink if you speak to the germans in white uniforms you get either clever excuses or exhausted answers the food in the la carte restaurants was consistently great the service staff is great and the cleanliness okay the cabin we had a suite has defective decorations flowers were missing there were no luggage scales paint is peeling off on the balcony and our couch was fumbling around in the aida lounge the wooden railing is secured with parcel tape during one show they messed up their stage technology so that one of the main shows was not played our suite at the stern always gets soot from the chimney so we have black feet or socks when we want to go out onto the balcony music is already playing in the lanaibar at am and the crates of drinks are being loaded loudly and noisily if something is wrong or something needs to be improved guests always have to speak to the staff proactively they dont think of it themselves to consider whether a bathroom mirror that is half crooked should really look like that a very large part of the ship is sick even the staff are now running around in sweaty tshirts and cleaning the cabins in the onboard hospital you are told that if you take a corona test and it is positive you have to be in quarantine for six days you should think about it which means they dont even try to test people for corona and just let them happily walk around the ship and infect all sorts of people apparently more and more towels are being stolen one day at lunchtime there were no more towels in the element port day because they had all gone on dominica we didnt get the space at the cruise terminal and were parked km north at a container port with a scrap dealer food and drinks are acceptable to good in the extracost range prices in the shops are ridiculously overpriced several elevators are broken half of the officers are making faces others are so artificially nice that you dont even believe it concept tourism for the precariat good for the baltic sea aida has no place in the highprice segment
never again with the aidacosma people smoke outside the smoking areas which causes the smoke to get into the ventilation and the hallway and cabin to stink strongly of smoke guests are constantly walking to the buffet in the restaurants with their used dishes and glasses restaurants where tables have to be reserved cannot be used for the entire trip as reservations cannot be made before the trip and cannot be made at the start of the trip either
very long waiting times at the bars sometimes minutes waiting for drinks whether coffee or cocktails
a few things have been dropped since my last aida vacation soft drinks on land more stage sets at pool parties crew activities in the pool area costs for spa area
the itinerary was beautiful the service staff was friendly with two exceptions and the atmosphere was relaxed
everything was perfect cabin food drinks service activities and shore excursions were very appealing and could hardly be better
good food clean ship
overall the trip was very nice however the staff in the spa area were very unfriendly we have never experienced anything like that in a hotel before we went there at lunchtime to find out about the offers we were told that we could use the sauna until pm that day for euros per hour a friend and i then went there in our bathrobes at around pm the same employee rudely told us that we couldnt go in today because there was an event taking place we pointed out that we were there at lunchtime and had asked annoyed we were then told that we could attend the event for the full price half of which we had already missed they didnt even apologize for the incorrect information all of our fellow travelers had already booked other events which we were then unable to attend spontaneously and in our bathrobes
unfortunately aida nova is an absolute disaster in winter from hamburg not recommended when fully booked
everything went well arrival checkin food shows staff were great
very friendly staff good food were very satisfied
good priceperformance ratio very friendly staff and a good range of excursions and activities on board especially the evening entertainment
unfortunately it is no longer what we know and are used to from aida in our opinion the quality of the excursions and food has declined considerably true to the motto quantity over quality
excursions and their processes should be improved for cancelled excursions replacements should be found do not offer coffee trips
all in all it was a pleasant and great trip what is to be criticized is the music and the djs who only play quottheirquot program and do not respond to customer requests
family atmosphere despite lots of fellow travellers cleanliness good organisation the staff at reception just needs some training they werent particularly helpful or friendly
we had a cabin below the kitchen from am to pm we heard dish trolleys and the clatter of stainless steel grates etc furthermore an extremely loud unit with strong vibrations switched on at all times of the day and night which after consultation could also be heard from the reception desk far away the resulting vibrations made the bed shake our request to change cabins was dismissed and even after repeated inquiries we received the same or no feedback to our request after booking the trip ports were canceled and another port was not visited during the trip in some of the service restaurants the portions were huge this certainly results in huge amounts of expensively produced and purchased food waste guests should have the choice and information about different portion sizes its a shame about the food this has little to do with sustainability but it would be very easy to fix we will not be traveling with aida for the next few years the previous trips were better
we personally didnt like the food the toilets kept breaking down which was pretty unpleasant in our opinion aida didnt react appropriately to a problem with another guest i or we will no longer choose aida as it simply costs too much for what you get
it was our first aida travel cabin with a balcony decks what more could you want we were overwhelmed by the ship by what was on offer food drink entertainment unfortunately after three days our holiday mood went from to zero the money was stolen from the cabin we were shocked we werent expecting something like that at all at reception they looked at us to see if we had made it all up and after a quick quotill report it to someone elsequot nothing happened we cant prove it its clear but we expected at least a little feedback
if you take your time you can discover new things and have a great vacation the service staff and tour guides are consistently well motivated and helpful the food on board is ok but still has potential the musical entertainment took a little getting used to
the service the food the hygiene and the silent party were amazing well be back was with my work colleagues claudia
the staff was always nice and friendly the pool facilities were cleaned frequently and the railings in the whirlpool were too hot to go in without hesitation
super friendly staff and everything from relaxation to fitness is possible i couldnt understand the people i heard complaining and they were probably the kind of people who wanted to take out their own dissatisfaction on others
aidacosmafilming on board resulting in complete and allday closure of areas such as the ocean deck pool bar sun deck no notifications no apologies for the inconvenience the ratio of passengers to the available loungersloungers does not match the outdoor wellness area is completely overcrowded there was a minute wait just to register in the area even though the booking was made online the pools are more like large bathtubs that the cockroaches felt at home in this was our first and last trip with aida
unfortunately it has many small to medium defects especially things that make a cruise
as always everything was well organized except for the trip to agadir that was also the opinion of other travelers we spoke to the food on board was varied and good service was top notch
great staff friendly helpful clean throughout the ship and a huge selection of delicacies something for everyone thank you for the wonderful holiday
the last trip metropolises from hamburg was unfortunately very disorganized the crew seemed poorly trained there were extremely long waiting times at the bars and in the restaurants there were also several technical problems with boarding passes having to be reissued the digital safety briefing not working and payment methods for the onboard bill not being saved
cleanliness questionable and far too many families with children on board who besiege everything
the journey by train and shuttle was uncomplicated which wasnt so good on the way back but wasnt aidas fault i still cant get used to the theatrium the cabin wasnt cleaned once which was bearable we just missed the little surprises nicely folded towels or the like
we probably both caught a gastrointestinal virus or food poisoning on the first day at sea and were bedridden for three days from the second day of the trip with diarrhea and vomiting the restaurants were completely overcrowded at all times and accordingly dirty the food in the buffets was below canteen level very greasy overcooked and the only restaurants we could consider were those where you had to pay extra even though we had already paid a lot of money for the trip to our dissatisfaction these restaurants were reserved for the entire trip on the first day so we set the alarm at am to get a seat anyway even though we were supposed to be on vacation as time went on more and more people on the ship became ill perhaps also from seasickness we dont know for sure and every few meters a passenger was vomiting in the public areas the ship smelled very much of vomit at times even though the poor staff tried to keep everything clean aida nova seems to have a real problem if we had known that we wouldnt have gone the only positive point we can point out is that the crew and the captain were very nice but unfortunately that didnt make up for the other bad experiences
on august i thought that if i booked the special offer with the comfort drinks package it would be enough to book the normal vario but according to aida i would have had vario all inclusive in the end because of my incorrect booking i paid the same price as the people with the drinks package statement after the trip from aida there are people who deliberately do not want the drinks package and forego getting it for free goodwill is zero of course i have no legal chance but when common sense is no longer present in a company and it is only about profit the customer is left behind in the mama mia restaurant the service was awful i crossed out the tip on the paper bill the next day i had euros for an ice cream sundae on my onboard account although i went to reception and explained the process clearly and credibly i was told that there was no point in complaining as a customer you are no longer taken seriously even for a trivial amount it is not about the money for me but about how helpless you are in the face of such injustices i am not going to sacrifice my vacation time to argue with aida about scoops of ice cream argue but it just leaves a bad feeling when in case of doubt the customer comes out on the short end would i go on the cosma again huge ship with lots of light but just as many shadows and i would never book directly on the website again only through a good travel agency
nice staff good and plentiful food gladly again
people felt good on the aidanova despite the large crowd
great value for money friendly and helpful staff everywhere and the restaurants have something for every taste
the ship is good with great service the food in all restaurants is top notch for cyclists who like to experience fast tours the aida offer is not suitable groups that are too big and everyone from young to old on one team is not much fun
the trip exceeded our expectations only the veranda cabin on deck was borderline not because of the furnishings and cleanliness but because of the impaired visibility and noise at night
cleanliness service good meals entertainment
overall we were disappointed for a total of in travel costs including excursions and drinks we would have expected more the food on board in the buffet restaurants was monotonous there was no local food and the same dishes every day the excursions were overpriced and sometimes chaotic the handling of complaints was slow inadequate and without any concessions the priceperformance ratio was unsatisfactory
positive super friendly staff clean ship great food anyone who complains should just stay at home and open their ravioli can it couldnt be better it was weeks and we had absolutely nothing to complain about in terms of cleanliness the food and above all the friendliness of all the staff now comes the negative the level of service from some of the passengers was abysmal and aida cant be blamed for that the jostling at the buffets with the idea that you wont get anything to eat for the next weeks and also at the bars was the lowest of the low if you need to constantly stand in line whether for excursions food looking for a seat finding a deck chair no chance from am all the deck chairs were taken people reserved deck chairs in the sun a deck chair for luggage chairs to sit down on deck chairs in the shade with towels and personal items the potential cannot be enough aida watched calmly and when i asked why this was tolerated i was told that as long as personal items were lying on the deck chairs they were not allowed to clear them in the elevators the used towels were simply thrown on the floor we have traveled all over the world but we have never encountered such a primitive crowd on the excursions people almost fought over the best seats in the buses and the best photo stops so if you need it have fun
its a very big ship but you can still relax
wonderful cruise everything worked perfectly food and entertainment were very good cabin was big enough and the staff was attentive and helpful the industrial port in agadir was not sooo nice though next door two freighters were being loaded with sandcoal it smelled of diesel exhaust all day and there was a permanent cloud of sand
the friendliness of the staff on board the variety of culinary experiences the quality and cleanliness of the ships facilities
sunbeds are still being reserved and nobody does anything about it thats annoying
the food is often overcooked im a master butcher by trade
we spent a relaxing holiday on the cosma the food bar service balcony cabin and all the staff were top notch its good that i didnt let all the negative comments influence me it was a week outside of the school holidays though so i would definitely book again
the atmosphere and the food were particularly nice and varied
the overall concept the port selection the selection and quality of the drinks and food offered in all the restaurants visited
quality has dropped dramatically particularly in the buffet restaurants no more cocktails of the day cakes only available in a few selected bars
catering cleanliness on board
western mediterranean with the aidacosma from november th to th positive very good food in the buffet restaurants great spa area great offers and care in the kidsclub great service in the cosma bar minor defects in the cabin were immediately remedied great evening program in the unfortunately often very crowded theatrium great leisure activities for adults and children very good shuttle service in the ports negative infinity pool could not be used for the entire trip except for the day of arrival due to repairmaintenance work too few fully automatic coffee machines in the buffet restaurants you sometimes have to wait minutes cabin allocation vario by aida with a child years very borderline as the upper beds are only available from years and can only be used by adults with severe restrictions exchange was not possible
very friendly staff on board it was fun the city center was always within walking distance the quality of the food in the buffet restaurants could be improved a little but it was ok the timemachine restaurant and the high ropes course were highlights
everything was top super friendly staff top kitchen mega clean very professional and very close to the guests
cabin too loud another cabin was not possible as the ship was fully booked the excursion did not include what was specified
everything was great friendly staff good food
ship top food could be better
on the last day in port on our trip to norway we bought smoked and vacuumsealed salmon that can be kept for days without refrigeration it was supposed to be a christmas present and we were told beforehand that this was allowed as long as it wasnt raw and was in an industrially sealed package it was taken away from us by security and almost kg of salmon and around euros ended up in the trash dear aida is this green cruising what justification is there for it that was our first and last aida trip such actions stick to you like the smell of bad fish back to tui cruises
so we took our first trip on the aida nova and have found that aida is more show than substance profit comes first thats the case with most shipping companies and then eventually the people come along we got the impression that families arent really welcome there are only very small childrens areas the swimming pool is a joke and the theater is mega small so personal both of our children are ill and are throwing up there seems to be a gastrointestinal infection going around on board im on crutches and my wife cant leave the room to eat anything when we asked at reception whether it would be possible to get something to eat in the room for the children and my wife we were immediately told no first you have to go to the doctor who will write you a quarantine order and pay for it the doctor costs around per person in general i have now found out that aida has a problem with gastrointestinal illnesses and that they are not getting this problem under control the shipping company has not commented on it either i will definitely have this quotdenialquot from reception legally examined and hope that something will happen on aidas part so i would not recommend taking a trip like this because they really only see you as a wallet and they try to squeeze every cent out of you if you have a drinks package it can take minutes to get your drink conclusion if you like big beds and being crammed in aida is a good choice the staff are mostly always friendly and nice even if they feel like they have to work hours a day if everything goes well on the trip there are no problems but if something goes wrong you are on your own and have to figure out how to get by at sea
good food friendly staff great shore excursions wonderful trip
feel at home good food prices still within the limits
friendly service careful captain good food very good shows the breaks during the excursions are too short for people with disabilities by the time they get off the bus they can get back on the internet could be more stable
the staff strives to satisfy all guests
super friendly staff as well as the entire crew great events on board food is super tasty
cold food in the buffet restaurants terrible internet access no smoking lounge definitely not recommended for smokers
the quality and service in the buffet restaurants has declined significantly bottled water must be paid for separately despite the drinks package being included
service cleanliness and friendliness on board enhance the holiday feeling the food on offer is varied wellbalanced and very tasty
hygiene cleanliness and very friendly helpful crew members
first of all it was not our first aida trip and it wont be our last positive service in the restaurant quality of the food housekeeping service from individual employees at reception employees in the spa aida stars of the guest artists mentalist magician negative the bands and their singers were terrible the organization of the excursions and the way they dealt with criticism from the scouts was awful ports were cancelled and the guests were ripped off with excuses as to why the next port wasnt being reached earlier the hosts pure selfpromotion entrance fees to the spa are a ripoff reserving sunbeds for hours was tolerated no information for guests regarding the dress code in the restaurant individual ports on the trip should be deleted the two alleged comedians were really bad all in all our trip was nice because we were able to relax well we will never book excursions through aida again as they are completely overpriced and badly organized you can get them much cheaper and better locally it is better to book massages on board at the special price than in advance at the regular price there were definitely too few staff at the bars on the days at sea and the bartenders were completely overwhelmed we know that there were big differences in the prices for this trip depending on the cabin category and additional bookings the trip balcony vario all inclusive for people cost us without excursions and spa and the priceperformance ratio was more than marginal
i have just returned from the transcaribbean cruise from hamburg to the dominican republic due to the many days at sea during the atlantic crossing i decided on the perla because it offers a much better wellness area and a wider selection of restaurants as usual my high expectations were fully met it is also worth mentioning that aida has finally put on a great new show called quotheart of the oceansquot which premiered on the perla in front of an enthusiastic audience during this cruise as usual there was very little to complain about i just wish that aida would finally offer the option of booking balcony cabins in smokefree areas so that the fun of the balcony is not spoiled by chain smokers next door what i will never understand is why some guests are constantly moaning and criticizing but i guess thats something you have to accept with a predominantly german audience
in several aida trips on different ships the food in all the restaurants i visited on aida diva was absolutely topnotch the host team worked very well together and each of them was very committed to their tasks they all deserve great praise the entertainment on board was mediocre the evening prime time was appealing but the guest artists especially the magician were rather below average the only convincing guest artist was eric paisley whose shows had the guests on their feet with enthusiasm the rock show and the abba show were also brilliant and should be repeated
not everyone can attend evening events there are not enough places in the past before corona there were two per evening now there is only one and only three times a week what a pity the quality of the excursions is much lower than years ago only the price is higher if excursions are cancelled there is no apology no replacement but quotyou get your money backquot a day of a holiday wasted and who will give me that back
on aida nova from kiel to hamburg in november there was little reason for complaint checkin in kiel took longer than usual for aida standards but at just under an hour it was still acceptable everything on board was clean and well organized our balcony cabin on deck port side with a walkin closet met our expectations with all inclusive deluxe there was limited internet access and drinks in the specialty restaurants we used if you specialize in one or two bars you should also tip there in the form of or via the signature display it helps a lot if you need to go faster otherwise the brauhaus is worth mentioning wellknown hearty delicacies are well prepared and served quickly there the steakhouse is also worth mentioning in terms of quality but keep an eye on the prices checkout in hamburg was quick and uncomplicated but the shuttle buses could not be booked on the ship so we had to take a taxi to the main station for around conclusion aida with selfdrive balcony cabin and deluxe all in for under ppd was worth the trip for us
its a disgrace that you cant even go to the sauna spontaneously
mediterranean cruise with aida cosma from november rd to november th great ship great staff very tasty food
aida cosma monster ship the entertainment was bad there was no holiday feeling the service was bad the food was mediocre sometimes cold or it wasnt refilled for example i waited half an hour for bread etc no seat at the theater the service was a disaster etc etc
nice ship but booked a topper in advance via myaida unfortunately not in the cabin on arrival reported via cabin phone minutes later cabin steward comes and brings a dirty topper with probably blood on it and wants to put it on my bed another change since i have a double room for sole use i now ask for toppers for both beds according to the phone no problem cabin steward then wants another due to the circumstances i refuse to pay another massage booked communication problems because only english is available no inquiry about complaints in advance positive restaurant kiss amp bella donna
very good organization of the arrival the service the food and the routes
great offer on the nova all around friendly very attentive service staff these people do more than they can be compensated for all the food is recommended if you are bored on board you are doing something wrong only the cabins that are sold for the premium price are not worth the money in some cases aida should know that nevertheless these cabins are still being sold for a lot of money i personally think that is fraud that is why it is only stars
we had a very bad inside cabin in the premium tariff on deck with constant background noise day and night for days our problem could not be solved we had no relaxing value on our vacation we were very disappointed what a pity this was our th cruise with aida we have never experienced anything like it
everything was great food could have been warmer friendly clean service perfect
the aida cosma has a wide range of options on board in all areas the food tastes excellent everywhere but the dishes in the buffet restaurants could be more varied it is designed so that there is always the same thing there so that you dont miss anything if you have reserved one of the specialty restaurants however i dont think the concept is fully developed enough as you have to reserve in the specialty restaurants for the whole trip on the first day of the trip otherwise you wont have a chance to eat there this means that you then have to eat mostly in the buffet restaurants where the dishes are always the same overall the show program was very good again i think the tv studio is great unfortunately the second theatrium show always runs parallel to the tv studio so if you want to see both you always have to watch the first show in the theatrium the time slots for reserving the specialty restaurants dont always allow this in mamma mia for example the drinks and food are brought super quickly in the beach house the food is really great but the service takes forever we waited minutes for drinks alone and then the food arrived after hours the whole evening was gone unfortunately the shows were repeated twice during a weeklong trip which i didnt like there was a lot more variety on our trip in february what i find very positive is that in february i suggested that the street food also serve vegan currywurst so that i could eat there with my husband now in november this has already been implemented you can now also call up the menus of the specialty restaurants directly on the onboard portal which is much more practical than walking through the restaurants and taking photos of all the menus to then decide the ports were great the number of days at sea was kept as short as possible which is very good the excursions we booked were all perfect the organization there was top notch the staff were very friendly and helpful at all times
there is always something that fits in with our previous trips with aida either it was a cabin swap because of unacceptable noise levels or rerouting or being stuck at the airport in chaotic conditions the smaller sphinx ships are getting on in years the atmosphere is cozy but the cabin design is not modern and not to our taste why is the tv not opposite the bed for example the waiting times at the bars are extremely long the food in the numerous buffet restaurants is very varied but even there there is very noisy and queues at the buffets if you are lucky enough to get a table the shows are always repeated in character and style depending on the ship the ensemble has better or worse singers the rest has a ballermann character hits after hits whether silent party pool party or karaoke for warmer areas there are no quotrealquot pools especially on the sphinx ships more like paddling pools for children conclusion aida is also possible but we like other shipping companies much better
the cabin was very nice balcony cabin very suitable for families with children food in french kiss and casa nova was very good the number of passengers and size of the ship were borderline for us pensioners
top aidacosma ship great value for moneytop food special praise to michael cornely
we had a room with a lot of noise pollution there was apparently a serious soundproofing problem here the elevator ringing from all the elevators could be clearly heard in our room every seconds it was practically impossible to sleep instead of offering us a faultfree room from reception we were offered a room change same category in writing for a rebooking fee of eur which in my opinion is a legal impertinence aida would have been obliged to provide a faultfree room in addition there was the inappropriate reaction of the staff at the aida reception to our request for a quiet cabin quotwhich is what we would expect with a vario bookingquot
great service delicious food practical and tasteful cabin good entertainment firstclass cruise
big ship the cosma maybe too big but up to date if youre going to cruise then make it as environmentally friendly as possible
perfect for families with kids but very crowded st week of november and long queues everywhere at the buffet etc
cold food in the market restaurant error with the invoice processing of cancellation or chargeback slow and only done after repeated requests by reception and not by the concierge
hopelessly overcrowded ship profit maximization at its best amp so that in the end no one understands what they can order when and at which bar there are in words five symbols on the cards for the various drink packages if you book a trip with the largest package allin or deluxe or comfort im not sure which is the really big allinclusive package the price advantage compared to meinschiff is gone there are also fewer people on board and when you think about it if you like traveling with aida please dont change
the cabin service was good and the waiters in the restaurants always had everything under control
limit yourself to what aida can really do and what also has a certain authenticity no distractions especially in the offers and in the too many specialty restaurants quality higher quantity lower
booked a suite arrived at pm the suite was still the previous occupant great start adia gave us house champagne which was a great bonus ordered champagne for dirty glasses and the champagne bucket was particularly delicious ate at the teppanyaki restaurant and my wine glass was tipped onto my trousers because of the great show nobody asked if we could take the trousers to the dry cleaners
great ship great extensive buffet in every restaurant service always friendly and courteous it was great and exceeded my expectations
unfortunately the service is getting worse every time for example this time we had to wait minutes to order a coffee in the caf there is no help at all in the selfservice restaurants my grandchild was yelled at when she asked for fresh glasses of juice
first cruise im still excited it was sooo beautiful the captain and the entire crew reacted well and calmly when there was a man overboard
staff was very nice food very good and always cheerful from service team to captain
aida takes care of everything the service the cleanliness the food and the friendliness are top notch from booking to the flight home everything was perfectly organized thank you for the two wonderful weeks
the ship is too big the really great staff is overwhelmed waiting times are too long everywhere buffets entertainment bars etc
beautiful ship despite the size no feeling of being cramped
its getting more and more expensive but the service is getting worse its just mass processing after years of aida never again the extra costs for the sauna alone are outrageous plus other examples
the staff at reception bars restaurant and cabin cleaning are always competent and courteous you feel welcome the good mood and politeness of the staff is passed on to the guests and creates a pleasant feeling
very friendly courteous staff beautiful clean ship great shows and artists were a lot of fun but children over pay full price for excursions and the already expensive shuttles and everything that used to be included now costs extra coffee in the afternoon drinks in the burger restaurant sauna the worst thing however are the budget airlines that dont even serve water on hour flights are ancient and have really bad reviews what a pity
incredible experience beautiful cruise delicious food exceptional experience everything tip top except the wifi on board which was slow
all the restaurants were top notch friendly staff internet was very bad
the cabin wasnt cleaned when i arrived and all the food i quotenjoyedquot there was half cold and bland
very unsatisfied food was good if you got a seat information was poor what was good was the parking service because it wasnt booked through aida
the logistics of arrival and departure and the entertainment never fail to impress
everything was perfectly thought out even with passengers everything was quick clean and friendly a holiday from start to finish
on aida all the staff we came into contact with were very courteous and friendly housekeeping service bartender entertainment but the kitchen management was particularly impressive every guest on aida should see the dedication with which the food is prepared below deck for so many people afterwards we enjoyed the food even more and could not understand some of the criticism from others at all a huge compliment to the kitchen team
children are unfriendly for example halloween poor organization for example departure problems are put off but not solved
the aida costa was too full when the ship is fully booked there are long waiting times everywhere you even have to queue to do some exercise and at least cardio machines were broken the staff were mostly not particularly friendly things were uncoordinated at the bars in the buffet restaurants not everything was available no butter in the morning no nutella etc there was no possibility to book different drink packages per person within a cabin the balcony cabin was great the food in the restaurants was also very good the show was good as was the live music
the relaxed interaction between the guests
doors are too heavy for wheelchair users and also for elderly people in the cabins
we booked the aida trip from hamburg to gran canaria the itinerary was adjusted in advance so that more days at sea had to be available and good destinations were cancelled one port was also cancelled completely after departure there were far too many sales shows on board we are used to stage programs and content that are different from aida the onboard program for children and young people with families on vacation was not adjusted at all sports courses en mas although children can only go to the studio from a certain age far too few offers such as cinema in the four elements family parties etc no small prices or far too few for children the middle area plaza deck was used for the onboard program including for presentations and sales shows less for activities
great service delicious food lots of variety great ship it couldnt be better
i tried it but its not my cup of tea even after the holidays a vacation with a small child on the aida is not relaxing for me i would never have thought that the industrial ports would bother me so much despite the new ship there are always technical glitches there is always something broken or defectiveout of order on the play equipment the changing opening times of the buffets annoy me and basically its the same everywhere the food is ok to delicious you cant be late otherwise they dont refill the food and the food in the warming container is just soso there is always something unavailable you run yourself ragged on the ship then i seem to have developed a strong aversion to these towel reservations i am german and find it absolutely annoying unfortunately my child cannot access the childcare facilities which is why of the attention is still on us there are various reasons for this i can understand that it all seems a bit much and hectic for him so i wont do it again
very well maintained ship friendly staff interesting excursions good food
unfortunately the ship was completely overcrowded small children couldnt swim properly because the older children were jumping into the pools from all sides unfortunately complaining didnt help because aida isnt responsible for this parents are supposed to keep an eye on this but there were no parents in sight for older children restaurants were completely overcrowded and there were long waiting times
aida sol english channel amp bay of biscay september food the buffet restaurants often served the same dishes for example on out of days there was a sweet potato casserole or times the same mashed potatoes from the bag oftenalmost always the dishes were not seasoned sufficiently on the socalled quottheme eveningsquot there were one or two main courses based on them the rest was a variation of what was served every day starters and breakfast were also identical every day if there was a variation it was uncreative and not in keeping with the theme example french onion pie on the greek evening in addition there was not a single theme evening that matched the destinations in the brauhaus and best burger the food regularly came before the drinks which suggests that a lot of the food was precooked the food was correspondingly uninteresting and above all lukewarm burger patties tk food and service in the restaurants with a surcharge were perfect but here you are forced to pay extra because of the unacceptable quality of the rest if you want it to taste good conclusion poor insufficient drinks packages very dependent on where you order them after days we knew who we should only order bottled goods from and who could make a drinkable cocktail drinks packages are unnecessary as the corrupt bartenders sometimes sell their quotownquot allinclusive for a day accordingly as a guest with a drinks package you are treated at a disadvantage as soon as the staff know you as you dont tip above all you feel like youre being ripped off as a guest with a drinks packageallinclusive the drinks from the allinclusive sold by the bartender to the guest next to you are then discreetly booked so that the inventory is correct if we had drunk everything that was booked for we would be severe alcoholics service see drinks often you have to buy service here in general the same goes for buffet restaurants if you give someone they jump straight in and clean a free table that has been free for minutes but dirty for other guests are also told that they have been sitting long enough and should leave and for you get the allinclusive package with an unofficial table reservation for the following day in the area of the waiter in question i have never experienced such corruption without a tip in advance of the time you will eat at least the starter at a dirty table until someone comes to clean it and you can also forget about drinks service without waving your bill it is beneath me i work in the hotel industry myself and i am the last person who doesnt tip but the service has to have been good the fact that i have to buy service in any way is new to me entertainment we were often bored it may also have been due to the higher average age but for example the same introduction by the entertainment manager every day was embarrassing by day at the latest and you could no longer hear it just like the quotbyeeeeeequot or the standard playlist in the aida bar when there was no live music the cabin and spa were flawless some of the staff were not very experienced with the infusions but this has been improved aida cannot be held responsible for the behavior of other guests however misbehavior was too often knowingly ignored sitting at the outside bar in your underwear tapping liters of orange juice from the buffet in pet bottles eating dinner in flipflops are just a few of the nogos that were clearly seen and ignored by the staff the ship and the outside decks as well as the loungers etc were in a miserable state inside everything was in very good condition the last port was cancelled due to an alleged storm and when we sailed past it the following day on the additional sea day it was degrees blue skies and a light wind this saves you the berthing fees and generates a decent amount of onboard revenue for another day quotselectionquot was just the price on this trip once and never again never see aida again
explain to your guests how everything works german speaking service please change the boarding pass systemthe entertainment is very monotonoussome restaurants especially the shuchi restaurant are not worth what we paid for this trip first ask the customer if he wants to have his drinks refilled in the minibar and have to pay a fee for this sorry if the text is not correct we are dutch and i did everything with google translate
aida prima metropolises from hamburg western europe october th november th dishes and cutlery were not always clean and had to be replaced frequently the pool area was far too small to delight guests in the fall the live music was often far too loud to the point of pain bad sound technology boiled softboiled eggs were often offered almost raw and completely liquid the big stage show premiere which was advertised for a week was first postponed because of the sea state and then canceled due to technical problems and shown as a video the theatrium was far too small to offer the large number of guests sufficient visibility the balcony door was leaky and the wind whistled loudly into the room many stage shows were solely for selfpromotion and to introduce the company aida sportcenter threw users under the age of out of the sports area even when accompanied by their parents at the end of the trip the sports department apologized and explained that the trainers had not known that the fitness area was only available to people aged and over and without parental supervision this knowledge was of no use to our yearold daughter at the end of the trip as she was refused access to the sports area relaxation in the sauna area was only available for an additional fee the ships language was mainly english drinks at the bars were usually only available after a long wait staff were very friendly and helpful the ships berths in the harbors were very remote and in bruges they were also close to the military area so the ship could only be left by bus shuttle this was unfortunate as after an unexpectedly long layover evening excursions were no longer possible as the shuttle bus was no longer running
the show program is a mixture of kidi club and schlefaz the group is not bad but the show itself ended after minutes priceperformance ratio is not right star price for star performance the cabins are very loud deck at the front doors bang the vacuum toilet sounds like gun thunder even those from other cabins
with a few exceptions such as the massive waiting in the corridors during shore excursionsformalities the organization staff program and priceperformance ratio were good to very good unfortunately the sometimes inconsiderate aggressive unfriendly and rude behavior of the predominantly older guests was not that was the real problem the staff who were also confronted with this deserve a big compliment i was shocked by this kind of behavior and it can be described quite well with the term quotlate roman decadencequot
too many passengers long waiting times everywhere drunken fellow passengers vomiting in the aisles and putting out their cigarette butts everywhere hardly any free seats in the restaurants very high noise levels throughout the ship
harmoniously coordinated furnishings on the ship beautiful balcony cabin the many people are spread out very nice service restaurants with good menu choices many dancing and party opportunities a wide range of sports and also many other entertainment options
it was our first time on the large ship aida nova and we were pleasantly surprised it was fully booked but the waiting times and the service were still good however some areas are much too small eg the sauna area the outdoor pool various restaurants such as the east restaurant
a very familyfriendly ship very friendly staff always with a smile on their faces good food had a lot of fun never boring
great ship quality of the food and service were very good priceperformance ratio of the internet offer is poor too much money for little data volume
mass tourism bad food cosmayouth hostel
we traveled on the aida nova this ship was very crowded in all public areas waiting for restaurant seats and the full buffets were an absolutely negative experience otherwise we were satisfied with the aida concept
very well structured and organized process good selection of drinks and food friendly and attentive service staff
unfortunately it is no longer comparable to previous experiences in kiel overpriced and poorly signposted and organized parking garages long queues despite having reserved a time hardly anyone to talk to overcrowded ship sometimes lowclass guests due to too many cheap or inside cabins often quotballermann level or groupsquot event program and quotartistsquot very simple and cheap even in the paid restaurants unfortunately rather simple quality and usual service but overpriced etc
food good well planned excursions and the staff does their best
great ship super friendly staff very clean
enjoy your meal
poorly structured signage far too few seats in cafes restaurants bars etc in relation to the number of passengers poor entertainment and too few seats in relation to the number of passengers far too little vegan selection in the various restaurants and in the cake selection onboard language not german as stated not at all in the restaurants etc
cleanliness service food and drinks
service and food are getting worse and prices are rising regular customers are being downgraded by the new club system it takes away the incentive to travel often with aida
we boarded very early and our cabin was ready for occupancy our cabin was also cleaned promptly every day to our complete satisfaction information was provided regularly and promptly so that we were well informed about what was happening
very inconvenient at the bars everything takes far too long best all inclusive
hygiene after the excursions pay attention to temperatures in the bars you are not allowed to fill up your own bottles at the water stations in the restaurants
the ship is extremely clean the staff are friendly and helpful the buffet food is great the guests are well looked after and the entertainment program is top notch
cabin ok staff very friendly and helpful little variety in the quite good food ship aidanova too big the large number of passengers means constant queuing almost everywhere the lifts also cause waiting times as they apparently cannot cope adequately with the crowds apart from offpeak times meal times are strictly timed
cabins too small deck too loud aida nova
completely overcrowded ship hardly any space outside the cabins to relax if you are looking for seating for more than people for shows and events you have to reserve seats at least hour in advance a torture for families with children when you have to walk around the ship in circles for minutes to find a place for a coffee break with a book pool area always hopelessly overcrowded so that you cant see the water for all the people there are no free tables in the restaurant even at normal familyfriendly times but there is a lot of jostling and no consideration for children you can only find tables again minutes before the restaurant closes if the children can hold out that long it is best to travel as a couple or with older children who canwant to move around the ship alone
days in line what was supposed to be a short trip to norway turned out to be a day queue simulator the muchvaunted variety of restaurants was unfortunately only there on paper of the restaurants you could only use because the specialty restaurants were already fully booked on the first day and the other restaurants were only available for an additional charge like almost everything these buffet restaurants were visually divided into themed areas in terms of food only the shape of the pasta differed otherwise there was the same thing every day for lunch and dinner with minimal deviations in the menu this experience was complemented by a real battle for a seat this is where the next problem arose the ship was hopelessly overcrowded the wellness area was unusable because it had turned into a play paradise for children who didnt know any rules if you managed to get a seat in the whirlpool there was only murky water waiting for you you could of course also have booked a wellness area for an additional charge the only bright spot on the ship days were the evening programs but unfortunately the seating problem was again apparent here there were around places for guests therefore the seats were quotreservedquot well in advance by various guests and seats were often reserved at once using handbags and jackets since children up to years old are free they piled up on the ship the parents preferred to put them in childcare or leave them unsupervised so they could devote themselves to drinking alcohol without this the whole thing would have been unbearable anyone who booked a drinks package might as well have thrown the money off the ship as the wait at the bar was often up to minutes for drink in conclusion you should definitely avoid the holiday season and make do with a maximum of a star buffet if you want to book a trip with aida in addition there are high costs for extras that should actually already be included in the trip price
well organized from start to finish the shows are great and varied the food is varied great for children
it was our th aida trip if it had been my first it would have been my last the size of the ship doesnt give you the feeling of being on a cruise far too many passengers and far too few staff we sometimes had to wait an hour for drinks or there werent enough glasses the staff tried very hard but the workload was simply too much to handle the quality of the food and entertainment was good but the quality was simply lost in the fact that it was far too crowded
we family kids booked a large veranda cabin on the aidanova the ship is incredibly clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful the food was of outstanding quality no noname products and always freshly prepared we will definitely come back
warning im currently on the nova and like two other guests who were at the reception with me it seems to be standard practice to book two minibars at each even though the bottles havent been touched absolutely poor service
the last time we were on the aida was years ago and in february of this year on the mein schiff this allowed us to make a direct comparison although aida did relatively poorly here cost savings were made everywhere no more water dispensers cleanliness in the toilets in the restaurant area could be improved the cake selection has been reduced to a minimum there used to be great cakes and the tasting takes place in the aida bar coffee is charged extra no decorations such as carved fruit food rather mediocre there was no rabbit or duck legs and they also saved lobster on the last day fish watery and overcooked steaks often tough or stringy the cocktails are overpriced and do not taste good contain more ice than alcohol white wine tasted very different initially ok later diluted red wine and beer were fine topper for the uncomfortable mattress costs extra excursions overpriced and did not match the description during the snorkeling trip in aqaba no drinking water was served even though it was described as such complained to the scout and reception no response received corals were trampled and absolutely not worth seeing the most beautiful thing on board was the quotwhite nightquot and there aida showed that it can do things differently
the socalled vacation consisted only of queues a completely overcrowded ship and poorly organized
unfortunately the service on board the aida sol left a lot to be desired unfortunately there was no feeling of being pampered although the entertainment options were very well designed i missed good and fast service in the individual bars and restaurants
hidden costs overcrowded buffet restaurants and the resulting overwhelmed service staff onboard offers are not designed for the number of people on board and are immediately fully booked
the ship was absolutely overcrowded the staff overwhelmed and unfriendly the pool facilities were generally too small there was no way to relax
what is not good is that the staff has very little free time but otherwise we are very happy with the trip
condition of the ship unacceptable heavy signs of wear on eg seating food in the restaurants only mediocre service staff only partly friendly overall priceperformance ratio poor excessive prices for excursions
smoking on the balconies is completely unacceptable and should be banned the scouts responsible for the excursions have varying levels of motivation the working conditions of the employees are precarious aida that is not up to date that has an impact on the quality of service
i was generally satisfied unfortunately the loungers on the pool deck were always reserved with towels
everything aidalike x balcony cleaning ruined the experience very bad
we have rarely felt so well looked after and were served so kindly in all matters the guest is king that is what we live by here we were very sad to leave this ship and have to say goodbye to this incredibly wonderful time we would love to go back
a complete disaster apart from the entertainment program and the ports and destinations visited we traveled on the aida prima from hamburg to norway the motto on the aida is wait wait and wait again despite having booked a time slot we actually had to wait over an hour before we could check in a luggage lock was open for guests whats the point of the time slot when it doesnt matter on site everything is improvised in hamburg you also have to put up with very long waiting times at the bars we sometimes waited minutes for a drink and its always a matter of luck to find a waiter who has his cell phone with him to order the staff behind the bar mostly ignore you and once it even happened that a bartender obviously didnt want to serve me that happened at the casino bar i wanted to place an order at pm and was told that the bar was closed however there were four men sitting next to me each with a beer in front of them i was a little surprised but then went straight to the other bar here i gave my order to the bar manager for this floor and asked again whether the casino bar was actually closed he said no and i told him what had happened to me minutes ago then he went to the employee in question and had a short discussion with him and then came back to me and just said that i wanted to order before pm definitely a blatant lie which was later confirmed at reception as they could see exactly when i ordered in the second bar from the time booking a bottomless impudence in the themed restaurants we also experienced things that we have never experienced on a cruise ship before young german waiters who forgot an order which can of course happen just said succinctly quotoh yes there was somethingquot we would also have liked it if someone in the restaurants had pointed out to us that not all water on the aida is the same we ordered a still water and were surprised when we got the bill that we were charged so gerolsteiner from the bottle versus table water a note would have been nice some employees dont take ordering food and drinks or signing with the index finger on the respective employee devices very seriously sometimes the employee filled in the signature field in my presence by simply making a circle forged signatures the same goes for the pool bar no different long waiting times and unruly employees who give you drinks that you didnt even order but if you then point out that you didnt order these drinks ive never had a blue cocktail an argument starts and the employee becomes unfriendly in general we found that the main restaurants are designed far too cramped for so many guests you were constantly jostled in the narrow corridors as for the restaurant you obviously have to wait here too and you have to bring your time with you at all the cooking stations having breakfast with the family is therefore rather out of the question if you can even get a table why cant you prepare or precut a fruit salad for example sometimes its the simple things our two evening visits to the brewery were definitely positive here we only had to deal with very friendly staff and the food and drinks were delicious now lets move on to the wellness area my wife and daughter had booked a massage it was very cold in my wifes room however and she asked the masseuse to turn on the heating on the loungers the short and clear answer was quotits brokenquot my wife was then very cold at the end and asked the lady at the front desk if she could sneak into the sauna to warm up of course she told the employee about the broken equipment beforehand here too the short and succinct answer was quotno you have to book itquot customer service out of place another unpleasant experience for which aida is of course not responsible is the fact that seats or rows of seats are regularly reserved by travelers before the shows in the theatrium children reserve for their parents grandparents reserve for their children and grandchildren with magazines jackets etc typically german
i cant really recommend the aida cosma the restaurants are sometimes very crowded and the staff are overwhelmed a child spat in the restaurant and outside it it was only secured with a small yellow sign but not wiped down people walked through with their shoes and spread it around getting a lounger is a dream the guests argue on deck about the loungers which are sometimes reserved for hours without being used the staff stand helplessly by and react with quoti dont understand anythingquot the quality of the food has dropped significantly sometimes we had to look for a plate unfortunately our daughter had a stomach virus for the second time on the cosma i cant say whether it was the food or the pool water however some passengers were ill at the time as were friends of ours on the other hand the service at the bars was always good and our cabin was always clean
very friendly staff great offers on the ship clean ship too many children
all in all a nice short vacation but unfortunately some passengers lack consideration the doors have handles you shouldnt let them slam shut at am and you certainly shouldnt leave your children alone in the cabin and theyll destroy the furniture at night
confusing drinks packages all inclusive and yet hidden extra charges everywhere too loud too crowded little chance of free seats during peak times both at mealtimes and at the bars and pool not a really relaxing holiday but perhaps quite exciting for children
cruise to norway and denmark at the end of october despite the ship being full around of the people were children the staff were always friendly the food was good and the service was good the only thing was that the waiting time at the bars was very long as sometimes there were only or people working where there used to be that is not acceptable and i have already told aida about it despite that everyone was always friendly and did not let on that they were stressed under these conditions the outside area was unusable because of the weather and the pool area was bursting at the seams it is clear overall the th element as an area is somehow blocked perhaps aida can come up with a better solution for this otherwise we love the nova you cannot find such a rich range of restaurants even on land
everything was well organized very hardworking and polite staff uncomplicated bookings great experience
we traveled on the aida cosma the ship itself is very impressive and offers great opportunities unfortunately these are hardly used because there are simply too many people on board close combat in the buffet restaurants fully booked specialty restaurants defending seats even in the theatrium endless waiting at the bars reception mini golf etc annoyed guests because you have to queue for a long time everywhere crowds crowds as far as the eye can see overcrowded elevators that take five minutes from deck to deck because they stop on every deck but no one can get on because they are too full once on aida and never again then we also had a balcony cabin that looked more like a shop window in a shopping center gawking guests right in front of the balcony that led to a deck on the same level that was accessible to everyone absolute design fail at capacity a vacation on the cosma would be an absolute dream shame aida
completely overcrowded we were on the ship for a week at the end of october unfortunately it was completely overcrowded and there were queues everywhere in the restaurants there were no seats outside at all the buffet for dinner in the market hall was the best great staff unfortunately in the east it was exactly the opposite very clean and nice cabin
it was great the whole crew clean food delicious will come again
i have been on the aida over times in the past and on my ship three times after four years of abstinence because of the corona period i spent a week on the aida nova with my husband and his daughter the drama started at checkin despite a quotperiod of timequot in which we had to be there the whole process took two hours total chaos we were totally disappointed in my opinion its just mass processing the quality of the food is considerably worse than it used to be the food is cold in places even though we went to eat as soon as it opened loud everywhere tables are not cleared sometimes we wandered around for half an hour to get a seat somewhere and then ended up going out for a currywurst because there was no seat the cabin was dirty in places ordering drinks was a disaster you really feel sorry for the people who have to work on the ship you have to pay extra for everything the sauna was constantly fully booked reservations in specialty restaurants were also not possible because everything was fully booked we will definitely not go on such a big ship again and i tend to prefer to spend more money and go on my ship i dont normally write reviews but this had to come out
great promotions very good quality of food
we have been guests on aida several times before but this time it was just not bearable
the staff was super friendly in the restaurants and bars the service also worked well
the atmosphere on board was very pleasant the captain was very humorous and sensitive in his dealings with the guests the hosts were very open and always had a nice saying for the guests all the other employees were very hardworking and courteous
the organization and communication in the background is very good you have to like life on board you can only find peace and relaxation in your own cabin or possibly in the spa but we didnt use this otherwise you have to be prepared for sunbed reservations and shoving at the buffets in general we noticed that we had never queued as much in a week as we did there whether it was for the elevator food shore leave reception etc my review was edited shortened by aida and not published in full
you can really relax the workers in the restaurants are so nice and accommodating just great
the trip was not very relaxing because there were so many people on board there was so little staff
always happy service perfect food very good
the bathroom had mold in the corners the restaurants were overcrowded with people and there was nowhere to sit on deck if we werent there on time on sea days there were no loungers on deck elevators were overcrowded and there were long waits the sauna was no longer included in the price the drinks were so full of ice you might as well have just drunk water swimming was not possible as the pool was occupied by children
after many cruises with meinschiff tuicruises we tried aidablu this year lets get straight to the point the priceperformance ratio is not right at all eur for a balcony cabin for adults and a teenager for days including travel the restaurants are not even of average quality the previous passengers earplugs were still under the beds in the cabin and the bathroom in the cabin stank horribly a shore excursion was cancelled hours in advance due to a lack of participation
no service route changes without any real compensation mass processing no opportunities to retreat childcare limited in time family sauna only by registration and only during times when shore excursions are already limited orders at bars were not carried out several times orders were delivered incorrectly several times same order several times wrong so i assume that it was instructed from quotabovequot to try it if you didnt have a drinks package you had to drink the worst quality both wine and coffee the app is only partially suitable as important information is not posted promptly
dont go to the port and change everything get two other routes the ship is simply overcrowded and the waiters are overwhelmed
not everything was so good on this trip so many people and not enough staff
the ship aida diva is a bit old its perfect for families if youre looking for peace and quiet this is the wrong place for you even when the weather is bad theres always something going on on board

the interior of the ship was very clean and well ventilated the cabin wasnt exactly clean but given the time pressure the cleaners are under that doesnt surprise me it was almost impossible to speak german the female staff were often unfriendly it was my first time on the ship i wouldnt go on it again the difficulty in communicating meant that people were treated in a slightly condescending manner
great boat and great cabin well satisfied but there is a but most of the staff were very pleasant and service minded but unfortunately not all of them an employee in the restaurant buffet was downright rude when we sat minutes too long fortunately was reprimanded by another employee those who work in information must be careful not to give incorrect information and also be a little more service minded lots of lovely food but the hot dishes could have been a bit warmer would love to make the trip again
there is basically nothing negative to say about the ship the cabins are clean the crew friendly and helpful when needed the food on offer is varied unless you have food allergies or are vegan or both like me in that case it is advisable to bring your own food no chance of finding anything in any of the restaurants that is both dairyfree and glutenfree for me the breakfast buffet was limited to nuts and seeds rice cakes and crispbread with margarine potatoes green beans and a very limited selection of fruit and vegetables a bit thin for the high price this is for the information of the organizer and those affected otherwise there is really nothing to complain about i would do this relaxing crossing again at any time
unfortunately its getting worse and worse the fact that youre leaving the ship knowing that you might have norovirus on board speaks volumes since no links are allowed just search for them the food is completely overpriced and the price just doesnt do it justice the cabins used to be cleaner and its better not to say anything about the beds the fact that many parents dont properly supervise their children and they run around the ship without consideration and knock on the cabin doors is another problem and all of this at prices that are now completely out of control
unfortunately its not designed for a mini cruise theres no place to sit outside the restaurants on the ship except on the stairs unfortunately there are far too few chairs outside for the number of passengers how thats supposed to work in summer is a mystery to me the outside cabin was clean but would be too small for two people i lived in it alone and that was ok
we were on the color magic as a family over easter unfortunately we didnt like it at all completely overpriced for what was offered unfortunately the staff were also very unfriendly particularly arrogant and condescending in the sports amp burger bar and the piano bar germans are not welcome we had this feeling from the moment we entered the ship until we left perhaps we are simply used to something different and our expectations were accordingly high the only highlight was oslo a beautiful and clean city
booked as a special offer so didnt expect too much we were delighted with the outside cabin practical foldout beds lots of space during the day unfortunately a piece of candy fell out of one of the beds when it was folded out the whole cabin was very dusty and we had to dust it off before we could put our things down smoking is only allowed in designated smoking areas on the ship but there werent any so we smoked everywhere for me as an asthmatic it was a gauntlet my mojito in the panorama bar for around euros tasted like peppermint water i went to complain and had to argue for a long time in the end i got a new one it was prepared in front of my eyes shot glass of rum mini slices of lime fresh peppermint a little white sugar sprinkled in around ml of water ice and it was topped up with water it did taste slightly like mojito water the buffet in the buffet restaurant is plentiful and excellent drinks a bit expensive
very strange his name is rune restaurant manager he should be reported to the police as he the owner to know how the guests experience politiet restaurant sjef we were guests at the table but everyone was thrown out of the restaurant without being allowed to eat unfair angry pay extra attention to that rune you guys
bad service in the coffee the coffee bar in front of the reception angry employee in the coffee shop specifically a young lady in the color magic boat from oslo to kiel on february i just asked if she could throw some hot water from my daughters water bottle in the sink and with an angry expression she asked me to go and throw the water in another place when she saw that i didnt walked away she angrily took water bottle from my hand and threw the water angrily but never looked me in the eyes very rude and rude lady
we were very satisfied and booked the suite all the staff were very friendly but at a total of for the mini cruise including food and drinks in the evening i expect that wine soft drinks and beer will be available for longer than minutes not everyone drinks quickly a small adultsonly area would be great it was catastrophic loud in the restaurant even at pm there was only children screaming people were running around on the chairs as if the restaurant were a playground that doesnt have to be the case we paid a lot of money to have a little break dear parents the needs of other guests are also justified
after leaving work early in oslo to take the boat at from sandefjord to strmstad we returned to sandefjord at just spoke to the reception to find out if there was any compensation at least some food for the return as the restaurant visit in strmstad will not be of any use we were told clearly that there was not they dont know what service is they didnt offer a bottle of water
kiel oslo we have been travelling with cl for more than years the quality has gotten worse and worse on our last trip on march we had stains on the bed cover which can happen nothing happened after we complained we took the bed cover to the counter and were insulted rudely the dirty blanket was put back on the bed at some point it seems as if the business is slowly falling apart
travels a lot with colorline and thinks the service is good also takes the buffet now and then but this time we are placed at a table under cold air everyone at the table is freezing get in touch about moving the table this cannot be done it is fully booked so understand this and turning down the air conditioning at full blast was not relevant so for one table it is a good idea to bring a bubble jacket and pole gloves
nice trip otherwise but was met at the breakfast buffet by unfriendly staff the tablecloth was cliche and the table dirty she walked past several times without cleaning when i removed the tablecloth myself she reacted very rudely should be moved to a job without guest contact or released to more motivated young people who we have otherwise experienced as very good
it was our first trip with colorline for a ship that travels daily between germany and norway it was more norwegianoriented it would be nice if all prices were also displayed in euros and more germanspeaking staff would be nice we deducted points for the dusty interior cabin with broken drawers and empty toothpaste tubes from previous guests on deck beer is still served in plastic cups these sometimes fly overboard otherwise the buffet and breakfast were very good and of high quality unfortunately there was no carbonated mineral water with the meal staff very friendly
as many people seem to have experienced the room was dirty the entire bathroom was full of mold and there were also lots of hairs from various people i didnt even dare to look any further to see if it was clean for that much money you expect a certain level of cleanliness the internet wifi prices are also absolutely extortionate i would say that it might be ok for a trip but i would definitely not recommend it as a quotmini cruisequot better to save up a little longer and book something decent
certain employees in the buffet restaurant are angry when i commented on something i got a sarcastic response have a nice day with their back turned to me i was very surprised by this emotional reaction from the buffet staff also saw that one of the employees touched the food with his fingers was on color line sandefjordstrmstad disappointing experience will probably be fjordline line from now on i have now sent a written complaint to color line and if they want to correct it i will of course edit this text to something nicer another star rating
service is getting worse and worse at excessive prices the ships may have gotten nicer in the last years but the service is terrible there are far too few luggage lockers in the terminal and the staff in the terminal are not trying to find a solution on the outward journey we wanted to book the evening show but the ladies at the service desk were not interested in helping us and instead sent us to a closed counter at the show entrance at the observation lunch my girlfriend leaned on me and we were told not to sleep there or to drink less alcohol it is just cheeky and presumptuous what we had to endure on our family vacation i hope todays return journey will be better otherwise i will cancel my longstanding club membership mario hoffmann
we have taken the color line to kiel many times combined with road trips down europe they are expensive and have become even more expensive in recent years but due to good service we have continued to use this line but now we are beginning to have doubts in may on the way to kiel it was absolutely fine apart from the fact that during dinner it took a long time for the waiters to collect used plates from the tables on some tables it piled up and those sitting there piled plates on top of each other to make room and the restaurant was far from full days later on the way home it got worse we lost something under the sofa in the cabin and when we bent down to find it again we saw that it had not been cleaned or vacuumed there was a childrens toy there pastille boxes and quotdormitory rabbitsquot in heaps ive never looked under the beds before so i dont know if this is normal but at least it shouldnt be like this we went down to breakfast at then they had closed off the left and middle part of the restaurant for new guests there were now many empty tables but it looked as if the staff were already preparing lunch so everyone was squeezed together in the right part of the restaurant where it was packed and now used plates were not collected quickly enough either so new guests had to transfer used crockery to other tables and at there were no rolls left and only a few hard and dry bacon slices and otherwise quite thin of other toppings if this is how color line is to drive forward it will either be using dfds or driving all the way
hello we were on the color magic from december st to december rd for the mini cruise kieloslo with people we were a little disappointed with the service on board the quality of the buffet has deteriorated a lot selection and quality at breakfast the rolls were from the day before room service no cleaning no new towels in the show area you were dealt with quickly unfortunately no atmosphere we remember the mini cruise from before corona very differently what a shame what a shame best wishes hjkhle
we have been doing the mini cruise kieloslokiel twice a year for years it is always fantastic whether it is breakfast lunch or dinner buffet it is very good the cabin is always impeccable the shows are always great but this is my only criticism from the stage large laser beams are aimed at the audience which shine directly into your eyes you can hardly see anything anymore
we had booked seats in the buffet restaurant at the kieloslo passage at pm we were only informed on site that the planned checkin was delayed from pm to pm but in fact the checkin was delayed by a further few minutes we therefore arrived late at the restaurant the booking in the buffet restaurant is only maintained for minutes after which it expires even though seats are available we asked in the restaurant and at reception whether the credit for drinks from the evening buffet we had already booked at the passage or the course menu we had already booked at the oslo kiel passage could be used this was denied and we were referred to the service center i explained the situation there after three weeks i received a cold answer that the costs would not be reimbursed a credit was only possible if no other restaurant services were booked but were used without a reservation the company reveals its business practices sell noncancellable additional services as early as possible and in as many quantities as possible which are not refunded or charged if not used for the reasons stated managers on site act clueless and disinterested the complaints department responds after three weeks because of overload i will no longer support this business model
today i went to reception as a guest and wanted to swap my outside cabin for an inside cabin because color line had replaced the curtains and where the lifeboats are it is light in there even at night with the curtains closed i can swap if there is space but i have to wait until at least pm for each crossing when i asked why this was the case i was told that i was a truck driver thats right it is my job i am a guest a stressedout employer who pays money all year round for the crossings and like many others we finance your company if you are of the opinion that trucks are not guests or are not treated the same as other guests then feel free to write to me otherwise train your staff how to deal with guests because that comes across as pretty derogatory to me
absolutely fantastic paying for the buffet will check if we are quotwelcomequot to take our room cards then manage to give us water from the other table instead of giving us a separate quotwater bottlequot unbelievable that it works
dirty cabin leftover food under the beds on mini cruises star cabins in oslo are not cleaned and towels are not changed the evening buffet was of poor quality and on december th it was inadequate it was obvious that some of the dishes had just been reheated generally only lukewarm food name labels on the dishes were completely disorganized price for the breakfast buffet was in no way appropriate very friendly staff in the sports bar the shows were perfectly designed dancers and singers were excellent also very appealing acrobatics this was our rd but certainly last trip with colorlines
we went on a mini cruise on the fantasy a week ago everything was very well organised the boarding the room allocation there were staff everywhere to help it was really fun you should try it out i have to give a few negative points for the cleanliness of the rooms well thats just not acceptable the dust in the whole room hadnt seen a rag the foldout bed was covered in boogers i dont even want to talk about the mirror and the bathroom a disaster there was hair from the previous person everywhere the sink still had toothpaste residue and some brown bits i dont even want to start on the toilet what a pity
there have been many pleasant trips with color line over the years nice decor and often very good entertainment shows on board good food in the buffet most of the experiences are positive but the staff on board perform a variety of customer services tired of your job
last weekend i took a mini cruise with ms color magic from color line trip from kiel to oslo and back very beautiful boat looks shiny and despite considerable age still has an extremely modern appearance what a pity that the service both at the reception desk and in the buffet restaurant was so incredibly unfriendly questions were answered with a snarl we asked for a round table there were many available and that led to a complete tantrum from the restaurant employee present an attempt to get three new towels for the second day led to indignation and raised eyebrows at the reception and when we asked for the second time to the comment i heard it how do you spoil things the festive spirit and such a trip is not really cheap
the g rule was not observed in either kiel or oslo distance on board was negative before going ashore in oslo there were several references to covid checks but they never took place the cleanliness of the cabins also left a lot to be desired dust and a dirty refrigerator the service in the observation lounge was also very focused on the local guests
hello we booked a short trip from kiel to oslo with adults and children when we wanted to order our childrens spaghetti bolognese in the pizzeria at around pm lars informed us that adults were not allowed to sit if only four people ordered meals a statement like that is made when the restaurant is empty we ordered two bottles of wine and a starter plate anyway this behavior was so inappropriate and really annoyed us we would have understood if it had been full or we would have understood the comment that if it had been full you would have to get up sorry but children aged and dont eat well on their own apart from that we must have spent over two evenings plus the trip
incorrect information about checkin hardly any seats available inside without a business class booking and charging for wifi in the st century is just cheeky next time i will definitely book with the competition
color magic people kiel oslo kiel october nd october th the booking on the internet was well structured we upgraded the inside cabin with an outside cabin important and half board friendly staff and taking into account that the ship still sails under the norwegian flag home port oslo completely normal norwegian prices important best rate with the ec card the ship is already years old so everything is no longer brand new but clean breakfast and dinner buffet can also be booked separately stocked with plenty of scandinavian delicacies you cant get more than that safety on board recommended oslo bus tour approx per person or on foot everyone gets their moneys worth visits to the bars are accompanied by appropriate live music everywhere wheat beer approx long drinks approx irish beer in the monkey bar approx but litre snacks for the quotsmallquot hunger from to everything stable and very freshly prepared thanks color line
when checking in in oslo kiel only the booking number was requested there was no passport check in oslo or kiel let alone a corona check after boarding the ship we waited an hour until the room was cleaned it wasnt clean the carpet was dirty nails in the bathroom we would have expected more for that much money the buffet was delicious and we had a fantastic view while eating
it took minutes to disembark in oslo there are always queues in oslo but today it was extra bad quota lot of peoplequot was the answer we got this is completely unsustainable quite parodic when you have to wait for your turn in the spa center because infection prevention in the buffet restaurant you were placed close between two other tables even though there was plenty of space in the restaurant not pleasant when there are two of you who are going to enjoy yourself and you actually think it will be uncomfortable to talk at the same time the last time we traveled we were also placed close to a young couple on a cozy trip even though almost the entire restaurant was empty easier for the waiters we were told when we asked to be moved this crowding spoils a lot for otherwise nice trips
welcome from now on this is the stenaline of the future ie the new fishing boat that smells pork food on board taxfree is unfortunately wrong or to use a smokehouse now costs nok nok for trays of soft drinks
terrible service we were on the observation deck to enjoy ourselves there was a female employee who was far too teasing towards me and my daughter it will be a long time until the next cruise with colorline again if it is the next time
the trip itself was nice to oslo but nobody cared whether you were following the g rule neither when checking in on the ferry or in oslo also the room hadnt been dusted for a long time which was only made up for by the fantastic view the buffet was huge and delicious
booked business class to relax a bit from hirtshals to larvik but here it was full of lots of small children who got hyper at free biscuits and soft drinks it was not the relaxation we had hoped for
this is the third time i have booked this mini cruise and have always been so enthusiastic about the chor line after a few years i booked this mini trip again from december th to december th and was pretty shocked at what had become of this enthusiasm after years the ship is clearly showing its age and you can see in many places that a renovation is due the staff is totally stressed and very unfriendly especially at reception the young staff in particular gave the impression that they didnt want to work and the employees in the shop on the th floor the food at the buffet used to be much better than it is today it was more like a canteen service a shame you mustnt forget that its a ferry and not a luxury cruise ship in the past you still had the feeling on the color line ferry that you were on a luxury cruise ship another thing that struck me as very negative was that people tried to take money from guests wallets at every turn high prices it wasnt so bad in the past
absolutely outrageous stranded in hirtshals with young people because color line was being difficult left standing in the blazing sun and not even being able to go to the toilet for over hours without any empathy or water absolutely outrageous
color magic december great trip with children we had a star cabin with sea view connecting cabin for people it was nice and clean good food and pleasant staff almost everywhere still want to share the experience we had with an employee in the color shop store very unhappy old man we shopped for several thousand in the store and he got mad at us because the boy had taken out and pressed a toy in the store that played music this person does not know much about customer service and should clearly be retired this was the oldest employee in the store and clearly the most disgusting person we have encountered in a long time sad i would also like to mention that the man at the counter at the water park was very nice and helpful and all the waiters at the grand buffet dinner were very nice good pianist too great boat that is recommended just steer clear of old grumpy color shop employees
we booked a star cabin the extra space isnt bad but the bed is only m wide making it impossible to sleep there breakfast on the oceanic isnt bad if you could get a window seat despite the fact that it was all empty there was no sign of one if anyone was seated at the window it was a norwegian citizen the same was true for the evening buffet trips is enough for me now a th test is not going to happen again
i traveled with colorline for kr right before christmas ate lasagna on board which as promised was not quite hot hours later i became very sick this lasted for days when contacting the company i was promised that they would contact me this did not happen on the second contact i was asked to write an email days later i contacted again and the next day after days i was called by a responsible person he appeared rude on the phone and asked loudly quotwhat are you after you should know that without a test from a doctor you will get nowherequot the only thing i wanted the first time i made contact was advice on how to proceed and a guarantee of that the routines on board regarding the handling of hot food were in order possibly have temperature measurements presented for the day in question i later wrote a feedback to customer service but have not received a reply very unsatisfactory treatment i have traveled with colorline for over years
it was simply very nice and color line doesnt have to hide behind any wellknown cruise ship the staff is just great the customer feels like a king here the buffet is great and there is something for every taste the breakfast leaves nothing to be desired i can only recommend it to everyone
we traveled on the th of july had ordered lunch in the view ordered what was listed online on their site when we were going to eat then it was something completely different got told to go to the buffet there i got to talk to the master of the court from kristiansand he stood there and boasted and said that it didnt happen with them so i had to prove it there and then i didnt have my phone with me i felt that he was standing there and said that i was lying not very nice standing there but got a table in the buffet but had to pay nok again and i was told that i should get what i had paid for utsikten til bake havent got that money back and he the hovmeister from kristiansand is not customer friendly he should get another job and dont stand there and think hes something its bad customer service by him he should be ashamed its a shame that collor line has such employees so theres nothing good to say about the court master from kristiansand
very rude staff traveled with color magic oslokiel we were a young couple who had upgraded to vip was not taken seriously in the restaurant and then others around us were followed to the border offered coffee and tea we were told to find a table ourselves and were not offered a drink we sat down at a random table for two and the same rude waiter came storming towards the table and asked where we had hidden or stolen a handicap signwhich of course we had not done and said we would of course move immediately if we were seated wrongly he came over twice more and asked for the sign made a scene in front of others was a very unpleasant experience and ruined a lot of our experience on the cruise i regret not asking the name of the waiter only good experiences with the cruise with good food and pleasant personnel otherwise
the buffet is really good and there was a lot to choose from unfortunately only stars because the staff on the color line take money out of the guests pockets they dont give the change in noks correctly some people didnt even get receipts at the bar you really felt like you were being ripped off and it was no fun buying anything else there unfortunately markus at the bar was also pretty unfriendly otherwise everything was ok
there is no corona on board the g regulation does not exist on the color line the city tour was a disaster i should not have spent the almost on it before the trip started we sat in the bus for a full hour then everything happened very quickly eg holmenkollen out of the bus photo into the bus and on we go oh so many negative things have happened it is impossible to describe just disappointing the trips in previous years were fantastically beautiful there was nothing to complain about sad but true
missing and missing information about our longbooked tickets with color line larvik the accident in hirtshals we had to read about in the newspaper we still understand the situation that has arisen finally we received a message about rebooking to kristiansand and new travel documents were presented to us first the day before departure for us it meant getting up in the middle of the night and driving an extra two hours fair enough but when we get on board and go to the breakfast buffet that we ordered and paid for they had just canceled this and could not offer us any space or food in the restaurant the person at the checkout was also curt and unwelcoming sharpen your customer service color line the wording in the new travel document must be clearer we assumed that the refund of the breakfast buffet was a compensation for the situation nothing written about it being canceled without the possibility of food hungry tired and frustrated this was the last straw for us sharpen your customer service
the ship is beautiful but unfortunately only drunk men and thats annoying the food was not good and tough we paid euro for days for two people would have expected more the shows were great so were through with it
very nice boat we had mistakenly ordered the lunch menu in utsikten bar amp lounge and not the buffet but i thought we would get food we were hungry after a long drive we were directed to our own table great and eventually presented a menu a course meal with glass of drink the choice was different menus a caesar salad soup or a vegetarian avocado on rye bread dessert sounds nice ordered caesar salad a small salad with chicken some bacon and a few pieces of rye bread was served no way to get enough of this in addition the salad was not fresh brown in cut surfaces and semisoft in addition a dessert that was very good and coffee we were asked if we were satisfied and conveyed the abovementioned feedback quotit was a shamequot was the response from the staff quotbut would you like coffeequot during the time we sat there more and more bags of nuts chocolate etc appeared with several guests the food was an appetizer no lunch and the price nok per person cannot be recommended
we were on board the magic from november th to th everything was actually fine the cabin was clean the food was very good the service staff was very friendly and helpful the city tour was great we will continue to travel with them in the future
there were several things that were negative we have been fans of the kiil tours for many years but this was our last trip that you have to pay for a trip and then pay for everything you are going to do is not good pay for the showbathingwater until the evening buffet and a fortune for the children to play nok per game this is a lowcost trip for families with children you should as before you got a free show lower the price for games and free water with the food should have been a matter of course and i overheard one parent couple who asked politely if they could pray for the child so that he could swim in the childrens pool then the person concerned said in an arrogant way that quotif they put their toes in the waterquot then b they had to pay so service was so bad and being able to use the heads of those who work seemed completely out of the question and at the last show we had to sit on bar stools even though there were several seats that were free then you should have had staff who offered to sit where there was one they had received for this from me but no when they were standing instead empty no the color line is not as it once was so thanks for those of us who have been faithful users of you this was not good
sandefjord strmstad the boat outstanding logistics service food selection everything is far beyond what one expects
color line it doesnt have to be my disappointed friends if it werent for the huge quotamazing buffetquot on deck at the front opposite the slot machine casino which already serves up delicacies from all areas cereals fish sausage cheese hot dishes eggs in various variations salads vegetables fruit cakes ice cream etc in large quantities and usually freshly prepared for breakfast apart from the reheated completely tasteless quotrolls from the packetquot that you wouldnt even want to eat at home the quotmini cruisequot kiel oslo return would be an extremely expensive flop but the quotgourmet temple alone doesnt make up for everythingquot especially since it closes its doors after just under hours and is not open all night as is usual on quotcruise shipsquot the drinks menu in this restaurant is also quite quotnorwegianquot not to say quotspartanquot the selection of not necessarily highquality quotships winesquot is just as limited as the beers on offer thats all there is here the cabin standard is now below average more quotminiquot less quotcruisequot there is no real quotair conditioningquot but a permanent fan that can be regulated within a certain temperature range which cannot be switched off and creates an atmospheric overpressure in the cabin ventilation takes place via air gaps in the area of the cabin door which can therefore only be opened with force there is also no quothumidity controlquot which is why the air despite the temperature being turned down is so dry that quotless robustquot passengers experience eye irritation and throat swelling which then leads to limited or even prevented sleep a corresponding note at reception in such cases leads to the statement the cabin air is known to be bad there is nothing that can be done about it the air outside the cabins is considerably better even in the corridors but even more so on the quotpromenadequot on deck where you can get everything that is not offered in the quotgrand buffetquot in the restaurants there albeit at high prices but since they are not open overnight staying here is not a real alternative to the cabin you paid dearly for when you booked the wet room module with the plastic washbasin quotmade from one piecequot that is far too small and the semicircular shower that is quotjust about acceptablequot in terms of space is not only shipbuilding technology from the last century it is more than uncomfortable due to the high step in the door area not just for passengers with walking difficulties and the smalltile floor covering is dangerous when it is wet which automatically occurs when you shower especially when you climb down the step mentioned above to get back to the cabin when you leave the cabin which is fortunately very well soundproofed you might think of the mickey mouse steamer quotdisney magicquot except that you know that it is a quotkiddie boatquot which was not necessarily to be expected here at the beginning on the quotcolor magicquot everything is also geared towards children it starts with the quotplay cornerquot on the promenade deck quotmidshipsquot and then continues the bathing area on the upper deck has a giant slide a flow channel and paddling areas but nothing for swimming the quotaction zonequot with a shuffle table all kinds of video games and areas to run around in next door is the quotchip shopquot bratwurst and chips without end or as long as money lasts and for quotthe grownupsquot there is the whirlpool nok for a minute quotbubble bathquot oh yes the prices and paying in general the fact that the operator sells the same service at different prices on different occasions eg festivals and holidays can be seen in the booking calendar on the color line homepage however this was the first time we had experienced that early bookings unlike normal can also be really expensive and not just because a booking in the booking center incurs a surcharge of the shipping company does not allow itself to calculate the price at the time the service is provided but justifies the rather questionable business practices in its response to a complaint as follows from the color line letter the color line price structure is flexible and dynamic and the price at the time of booking always counts if you had wanted to react appropriately to price jumps you would have had to opt for the slightly more expensive flex tariff it may well be that the price for your minicruise quotgourmet buffet plusquot has changed since you made the booking and the price would have been completely different if you had rebooked however you yourself decided to make the booking early and you alone decided on the economy fare we do not see any basis for a refund as you have requestedquot end of quote nor a partial refund of the price of the booked and paid quotsightseeing tourquot due to a hour delay on arrival in oslo and in an effort to start the return journey with a maximum of hour delay the city tour was carried out as announced in the quotshort programquot around hours instead of the booked any kind of compensation none if they had known that the customer as an idiot per se was to blame for everything our friends would definitely not have booked with color line they therefore want to do their tour in december this year on the dfds route copenhagen oslo return in terms of scope it is an equivalent offer which including bus transfer to and from copenhagen is even cheaper than the trip described in addition they save themselves the stress of driving to and from the airport in their own car as well as an additional parking fee at the norwegenkai in kiel that would be fun from the moment you get on the bus
if you are a lot with color line you quickly realize whether you are with the nice crew or the much less nice ones you can already feel the atmosphere on the car tyres but when you pay are willing to for business class because you are tired then you are told that you cannot pay because the payment system is down but you can come back to pay do it to find out with many more that the code to the door doesnt work and that avarn has to lock everyone in then get told to go down to get a new ticket then go up find out that there is no seat number then go down to get this sorted then again to say that its unheard of you charge nok for this to get a sour smile then go up to find out that the fridge has been out of order for a while so the inside is not is edible even a politician would have quotlay down flatquot in such a case instead of stating we have too many products not to charge for anythingquot into the situation of the people involved you live off of customers of which there are evidently too few you do well to treat the customers you have left nicely fjord line
there were of us who were looking forward to a mini cruise since we had all been on a quotrealquot cruise several times we were excited to see what it would be like on a ferry the first impression was surprisingly very good nice large shopping arcade with restaurants and shopping opportunities the cabins are really very small the beds are considerably shorter than standard and they are also narrower there are no cupboards there is only one power socket the bathroom is small and very old we still dont know why all the restaurants were so crowded on sunday evening the burgers and fries are really tasty but what use is that in the evening when the restaurant closes at pm the main restaurants offer expensive food which is not to everyones taste at the end of the day we had to wait almost minutes for a table at the pizzeria the pizzas themselves were good the next morning monday we were supposed to eat at the grand buffet there were already people standing on the stairs some had a table others didnt we waited minutes there too it was not acceptable especially the fact that some people pushed in front of us but that happens everywhere the breakfast itself was ok until you get off the ship the ship docks at am and we were down at half past ten oslo is very beautiful there is a lot to do strangely enough on monday evening all the shops were free we got a table in the pizzeria without any problems the burger shop was of course closed again could someone please explain to us why a shop like that closes at pm there are a lot of young people and children on board incomprehensible breakfast on tuesday morning was not overcrowded either the prices of the drinks are really high so if you are traveling with several people and sit down together in the evening and want to have a drink it can be quite expensive its a good thing that we had already been on real trips before this trip because after this trip we wouldnt have wanted to go on a cruise at all
nice quiet business lounge with reasonable selection of fruit and drinks
here is my assessment of the superspeed offers assessment of superspeed august still star once again you pay for socalled quotbusiness classquot only to be stewed like herring in a barrel on this boat there are two areas of quotbusiness classquot but they all sit on the seats in one leaving the other part of quotbusiness classquot empty lots of noise and absolutely no opportunity to relax pretty incredible that this just keeps going and color line doesnt do anything rating of superspeed april star it only goes downhill here if you pay for business class you will be stowed away like herring in a barrel with recliner seats that destroy your ability to use the tray in front of you to put down the cup of soft drink that you picked up in business class if you want coffee from the machine in the department you have to be prepared to go to the cafe in places because this machine has not worked for several months are you planning to sleep not here because here you are pressed into a white tv screen that is on full blast for the entire trip and if that or the seat neighbors dont keep you awake then its the soda dispenser that explodes and the painting on the wall that isnt screwed down properly it is also bingo if the employees choose to dim the lighting which is not done if you take the night departure from hirtshals you will probably get more for driving the long way via sweden previous rating on superspeed in stars
positives first very happy with the cabin had stars and it was cleaned and everything in order breakfast was excellent both days dinner in the a la carte restaurant was very good and pleasant service but we paid nok to reserve a table for the evening show it was not possible to make a reservation without a drink package before departure the show lasted just over minutes we hadnt even had time to finish what we had been given on the table when we were almost kicked out ive been on the boat before and then the shows lasted almost an hour and were free this was not a good experience on day two we had ordered dinner at the grand buffet this was a total disaster there was complete chaos around the buffet not possible to see what was on the dishes we had to queue for over minutes to get food when we finally got to the hot buffet i quickly discovered that there were also cold starters of fish and shellfish along the way i found that several kegs were empty and it apparently looked as if those working behind the buffet were in no hurry to fill up i have eaten at many buffet restaurants in my life both on boats and in hotels etc this is absolutely the worst experience i have ever had finished with cheese for dessert half the cheeses were gone it looked like a pig trough pointed out that cheese was missing but the person behind the counter only replied that it was coming stood and waited for a long time but finally gave up we also considered going to the casino on board but peeked in through the door and it looked like a madhouse in there with lots of people lying across the tables and cackling
we have traveled many trips with both color magic and fantasy over the years and have remembered all of them as nice trips except for the last one we have just returned home from oslokiel and are so disappointed queue queue and queue again before the trip we had to contact customer service regarding parking you dont get a queue number on the phone and i waited hours to get through they were delayed on departure from oslokiel so there was an extra min waiting time to get on board we had preordered breakfast dinner x in the buffet restaurant on board there was such a long queue that it took up to minutes to get food when you finally arrived it was empty they were not particularly quick to refill so you had to take something else once almost the entire childrens buffet was empty there were sausages and glass of jelly left it must have been like that for a while according to another passenger the waiters during the meals were neither pleasant nor competent they didnt even know the types of wine on the menu water park before water parks were a super good experience it was not with my own children you must book a time in the water park in advance otherwise you will not be allowed in i downloaded colorlines app in advance and it didnt say that you had to book in advance to be able to swim we then get a time late in the evening which really didnt suit our young children very well but we had promised our youngest daughter ends up falling asleep so we have to split and take the eldest with us my husband was then scolded because we had booked for the th but thats how it is when you only get late times and have small children the water park was also tasteless so it wasnt a good experience for our son either there were also no water games like there were in the past show lounge attention only order what you can drink in half an hour because you will be kicked out after the show now the show only lasts minutes and you have to pay nok for a table in advance of the journey before the show lasted an hour and you could stay seated then there were some dancerspianists who entertained throughout the evening the staff was nothing to brag about either they were nice in the shops but otherwise the service was poor cinema there is no cinema anymore either died after my grandmother wanted to look after our children so we could go down from the cabin and have a drink the only live music was on deck but there were only older people sitting and looking around the casino was dead the bar in the pedestrian street was dead and the disco didnt open until the cabin there was a dense layer of dust around the shelves in the cabin the carpets were also not vacuumed properly colorline you can do this better
the cabin next door had two antisocial and noisy people we put up with the noise until am in the morning the customer service desk moved us to a outboard larger cabin an upgrade on another deck which was fantastic security staff were fab an controlled the situation as best the could
mike and henrik at the commodore steakhouse were brilliant always in a good mood its the th time weve sailed with them and would do it in rainy weather on mc if they stay on the ship long enough oh yes and the food was good good quality of good meat good preparation serving and not all sorts of junk on the plate that shouldnt be eaten anyway
the food was very good plentiful and there was a large selection i slept on a recliner which was ok overall if only it hadnt been so cold in the sleeping area i bought a streaming surf pass for but it didnt work there were no shelves in the only shower a small stool would have been enough
all over happy with the service and conveniences onboard prior to the trip it was difficult to understand what time to show up before departure i had expected it to be hour and not an checkin time frame hour to minutes this could have been better explained there could be more places and better information about where to eat picnic both in and out
the ship food staff and experience was all totally wonderful it was really letdown by a ridiculous long wait to show passports at the end we missed out train as it took over an hour it was a disappointing end toa great trip they desperately need more border staff
the explorer restaurant was excellent food wonderful and waiters very attentive we enjoyed the ship and the weather was perfect we loved oslo and copenhagenwell worth the trip
our cabin was clearly not cleaned when we arrived the table had clear marks from fingers there were remains of faeces in the toilet lint on the carpet which in addition to this also had large driedin stains after contacting the reception the table was cleaned but the rest was the samewe have never experienced the standard so low the other times we have traveled with dfds in the morning at while we are still sleeping our door is opened and a man cleaner it looked like it exclaims quotsorryquot before quickly closing the door again really unsafe the sailor club is a fine initiative and a good activity for children the food was fine and if our cabin had been clean there would have been more stars
got a cabin above the orchestra room the balkan gang with rhythm boxes went on until am come on board at didnt sleep for a second until the rant was over mob behavior at reception when we were offered earplugs two people aged and will never use dfds again dung boat ivind mathisen
the cabin on deck was a positive surprise it was clean had carpet and good mattresses the bathroom had been renovated and it was very quiet the evening buffet was very very good and the extremely friendly staff made sure we had a great stay
all members of staff were very helpful welcoming and kind buffet highly recommendable make sure you prebook it overall experience was amazing and would definitely do it again
booked a cabin with a sea view thought it was good enough single lower bunks with the worst mattresses i have come across woke up after three hours and felt beat up had to sit and sleep for several hours before i tried again woke up with pain all over my back fortunately i upgraded on the way home it worked out then got a good bed never more anything other than commodore suites on this boat the positives are the food and pleasant service
it was a very nice experience we had clean rooms the crew was very friendly and the meals were also great there were enough activities on the boat definitely worth it
in time very friendly staff clean rooms different options to be indoors or on deck
everything is great check in food entertainment a small issue in our bathroom was fixed immediately by the service crew thanks for that
quiet and peaceful crossing but when we arrived and it was announced that it was time to go to the car deck the door was locked and there were lots of people and crowded for minutes before you could enter annoying
i liked the kindness of the personell and the quality of the meals mij cabin was not bad but i missed a waterglass furtheron i did not like the quality of the ventilation in my first cabin is was very noisy and stuffy i did not find a possibility to reduce the noise and it was to warm without the possibillity to reduce that too so i had a bad night with a lot of wake ups and damp sheets the second cabin was not noisy but still with the problems mentioned above i am not a notorious complainer but you asked so i tell you
cramped dark long queues in the lift difficult access with prams poor selection of food in the cafe
clean and comfy great staff drinks are pricey and differ from bar to bar food is either a buffet or restaurant no real option for a snack unless its cake
the cabin was more spacious than i expected the ride was very smooth the buffet food was excellent the only negative aspect was on disembarking where there was a crush on the th level waiting for the doors to open
a little expensive cabin shouldnt be used too much noise from engine
takes the trip several times a year everything is usually good this time in commendore cabin it was really delicious and the morning food really nice the only thing that was not in the mess was the dessert in the course menu it was really a disappointing experience rabble and chocolate cake two desserts that both disappointed you had to have a magnifying glass to find something reminiscent of rhubarb and both cakes dry and boring i had a bad experience in the shop a lady in the perfume department she was really not very service minded in return the young man at the till was really sweet and helpful i thought for a fee smaller fee there should be an option to enter the comedore de lux lounge when you have an alm commendore cabin the live music was some of the best for a long time but previous bands have also scraped the bottom in poor singing and music we hope that what we saw this time is the future standard
very nice instructions and escort to the cabin the cabin was clean but extremely loud so you could hardly get any sleep it was a little quieter on the way back good food
no service in the cabin no changing of towels no cleaning no empty bottles were collected either we were down last year and had no complaints but this time we were not satisfied big plus was breakfast in the cabin
really disappointing service on board could only accept cash as system was down asked for a coffee with alternative milk stuff were rude and confrontational when i asked originally said no and i had to point out the soy milk in the fridge just not what you expect was like i was personally offending the bloke
friendly and accommodating staff fine restaurants bars etc finefunctional rooms but did you get a room that was connected to the ventilationengine couldnt close an eye the whole trip due to violent noise and shaking took away a lot of the good experience took a recording too bad i cant attach small stars are given
we had the owners suite at the crown it was very boring and very worn not worth the money a few years ago we had the same suite with an outside jacuzzi delicious minibar with water and bottles bubbles no it was a boring experience
very well organized on land and on the ferry great staff who are always helpful cabin is super clean food in explorer kitchen is super good visually great too the program on board was great drinks prices are on the high side it shouldnt be much more thanks to the whole crew for a great second stay
ship staff food weather views the only minus was that the cabin was not properly cleaned floor and ash in ashtray in toilet
overall we had a really good experience we had booked a cabin with a double bed the cabin was inside and we knew that in advance we were still quite surprised when we saw the cabin it was not much more than km plus bathroom although i have traveled with you quite a few times i had no idea that such cabins existed it is a shame to discover on the day and of course there was nothing better to get but perhaps the fault is our own we each got a towel this means that both hand washing and bathing should make up the whole thing and it is not so delicious for several days the bathroom needed a good thorough cleaning we ate at seas and there was a lot of food for us we eat vegan and fully agree that it is us who stand out but you could up the game to the greatest gratitude from people like us with a dressing or sauce for dinner and vegan cheese and butter for breakfast there was naturlis butter block on the first day for breakfast and i was so happy
it was very muddy in the cabin as well as elsewhere this time have traveled many times in the last years and have always been clean now there was a thick layer of dust on the cabin and mucky
booked cabin and ordered breakfast subsequent upgrade to a room where breakfast was included was told i could cancel breakfast and be refunded it also says on my booking confirmation that i have an amount that must be refunded but since there are less than hours until departure they will not refund the amount anyway as a hour rule applies this is despite the fact that the booking says remaining amount
a comfortable way to get overnight in the uk this in a clean environment with various facilities on board well prepared food friendly staff and a cabin with comfortable mattresses and a clean bathroom
great rooms and service on board had a great room and food great way to travel between the netherlands and the uk
everything is super from booking indcheck service onboard the food taxfree
excellent facilities on board superb buffet dinner breakfast with plenty of choice easy booking procedure excellent all round
there was no hassle and everyone was very helpful on board i travelled with a dog and all of his and my needs were covered there was also excellent service in the dining room
a trip on the wave blue is a must because i want to go to copenhagen super nice ship good food and good value for money
very pleasant service clean rooms one small minus for the dinner buffet was too simple and little choice on the dinner side breakfast top notch
good food and clean cabins but very expensive in bars etc
gives stars as i always get seasick on dfdsdont know why but very good service good food clean cabins
cabins clean incredibly friendly staff good variations in meals well prepared too
it was very cold in the cabin the air conditioner was set to the warmest setting but cold air still came out
we did the mini cruise to newcastle a great experience on board very friendly staff great food if you have a problem it will be resolved immediately the cruise more than made up for the fact that newcastle city was not really worth visiting
i like the food the service and the people working on the ship but our cabin was bad after nights in a bed with a broke madrass my back is aching a lot the beds must be renovated
food was good hut is dated showerhead was not working it is old and rusty door was not closing good
great service lovely staff lovely food great experience
very bitter woman in check in desk oslo rude unhelpful
super good staff on the whole ship
weather was bad food was burned prices too high
satisfied slightly tired cabins
too much business with the booking fee supplement when buying the trip and that coffee is not included in the buffet tough on arrival at kph why not fill two buses at the same time when there is a huge queue at the shuttle bus
simple access to ship both by using shuttle bus and quick simple boarding process good comfortable cabin and excellent food from the restaurant
the service was top notch and the food was super delicious
good entertainment with mille and benjamin nice trip only one bad thing was the lasagna in the garden on the boat was really sticky otherwise all good and me and my son will be back soon
good quality food and great staff helping you during the journey
cabins great food was ok outside decks rusty and unpainted despite news that the ship had recently been in dry dock for refurbishment
extremely comfortable cabin and facilities and all staff were polite and friendly
the room was nice but i thought it would be a little bit bigger the pillow was awful the roomcleaning has more too wish for the beds were not made good and the toilet was not cleaned enough small shitparticels were floating around the food at seas was okay a buff is a buff the food at the explorer was really good we both had rumpsteak minus for the onionrings they were not made at the restaurant felt like the ones you get at mc donalds nice but it should made by the chef i really really loved the athmosfere in northern lights so calm and old loveable music in the backgroundalthough the waiter mixed my drink wrong
the cabin was cozy the food was delicious but the waiting time to get on the ship is very long
good process from checkin to rolloff only the food was too expensive for the quality and temperature
the staff were helpful and pleasant and the food was good
good food good service perfect cabin everything was as exoected and as we have experienced before thank you
just like last year it was a good trip there are good facilities with lovely entertainment for the children and all the staff that we have been in contact with have been helpful and friendly a particularly big praise must go to the staff in restaurant seven seas where we ate buffet both saturday and sunday evening the servants are very competent alert service minded and sweet with a full understanding of what it means to have children on holiday a small minus is that we as a family with small children were put in a cabin on deck while a traveling friend who also traveled on the cheap offer was placed on deck in a cabin with a television we had no television we had cabin where the lock to the one upper berth was very slippery the lock in the second upper bunk worked fine but when you open it you can see a little worryingly that the hole that the lock is supposed to fit into is worn very large i was close to letting the experience with the cabin drag down the rating but i think the overall experience is close to a so ill round up and leave it there we will definitely come back on a minicruise with dfds to oslo again another time
comfort friendly correct servicegreat food cosy pub and compass bar nice duty free shop
we were well received by the hosts on both the outward and return journey cabins are neat and clean upon arrival food and service are excellent
great staff efficient boarding and debarkation
the service in the restaurant and the whole atmosphere on the boat
unfortunately the selection of food at the buffet lunch and dinner has been changed we miss the lithuanian specialties the late departure time saturday from klaipeda to kiel caused us great difficulties as we had to drive over km home on the same day of course there are positives to be said the cabins were clean also a big compliment to all the staff always very friendly and helpful thank you for the good trips see you next time
everything was great staff and the whole ship was clean and nice
we had a great trip the weather was also brilliant so we couldnt have asked for anything better except that the mattress in our commodore cabin was very hard and painful we also had to ask for refills of shower soap and shampoo as only a small soap bag was intended to be shared would have thought we would get a bag each it was also not refilled during the weekend so we had to ask for extra as we would like to shower every day apart from that the boat is nice and the staff pleasant the buffet was lovely as was the breakfast
way too expensive just trickery and the food was lousy
you have not changed our food menus for decades it has always been bland and terrible but this crossing was vomitinducing the fish you served reaked certainly not fresh and the smell took over the whole boat simply disgusting the pizza pasta and salad station only served margarita pizza that looked like a pile of frozen vomit you could not even see what you were ordering
delicious food and wide selection both dinner and breakfast rooms small but fine for night nice play area for year old daughter friendly staff and kept very clean
the kindness of the staff foremost clean and spacey ship
considering how busy it was on that day it was very easy and virtually seamless euro finals food was good and could still get a seat
the upper deck was closed the entire trip although the weather was very good thats the only downside
during my trip i always encountered helpful and friendly staff the food was also very good and plentiful
it is impressive how well planned everything is the food is good both in the evening and in the morning
friendly staff efficient service reasonable and tasty food on board clean ships
very good dinner and breakfast friendly and helpful staff
priority boarding and the lounge great lounge improved with more refreshments and extra snacks friendly welcome unfortunately we left hour late
basically everything was ok the only thing to complain about is that they charge for a normal bottle of water even if you book an expensive cabin the staff at the barreception could also be a bit friendlier otherwise everything was good food was perfect etc
pleasant trip to oslo and back but there are very few places to stay when not eating or drinking nice clean cabins why do the corners of the bed have to be made of sharp metal when it rocks a little it is easy to bump into the corners
friendly staff tasty food just very nice
we had a nice minicruise from oslocopenhagen and had a great time good service great mix of nordic cultures and funny bartenders and pirates
nice staff especially in the buffet restaurant good beds
friendly staff delicious food carry on
small number of passengers didnt feel crowded breakfast meal was well presented and offered a good variety it was the only meal i prepurchased ship was clean and staff was very helpful
everything from reservation to destination was smooth and relaxed food and cabin were great unfortunately there was no designated place for our dog to go along its business
top quality in the cabin staff and lovely food on the buffet the lounge was a surprise and not just in a good way but the selection of foodsnacks and drinks is lovely unfortunately there is no view to the sea only on the roof in addition some of the travelers with balcony cabins had the doors to their own cabins open these used the lounge more as their own rooms and we felt that we were in the wayhad nothing to do there this was uncomfortable
again it was a nice experience good service and restaurants pubs and bars with nice atmosphere i minicruise that i absolutely will redo in near future
in general the ferry crossing is good lots of seating areas and a good duty free shop however there is very limited food choice for vegetarians also decaf coffeetea options could be improved
the fact that our company pays for our professional drivers meals does not mean that you can feed us such disgusting food it stinks on the stairs and is unbearable in the service area its sad that you dont care that much about what people eat fish bent into a banana shape fries that stink of these fish what a failure you should be ashamed of yourself because as a professional driver i feel embarrassed going there for lunch eat it a few times yourself maybe you will come to the right conclusions terrible
the staff is very pleasant but unfortunately the kitchen goes the other way too bad that sj was killed by the pandemic
super good service such nice staff and lovely food we miss it already however we wish we could have had a cup of morning coffee before am
good ship clean cabin food ok exit in klaipeda very slow
all the staff were helpful and friendly food was great prices were fair all in all a very good experience
great selection of food good vibes and nice outdoor seating bit datedold room and not perfect cleaning of cabin floors specially bad
everything was excellent pleasant and polite staff all over the ship
comfortable cabin helpful staff
very nice mini cruise the food was very good the staff nice and everything was up to expectations
the standard cabins are still completely hopeless and outdated ate at explorer the chicken was tasteless our kids ordered the vegan burger which was dry and slow service but nice or else ok but you guys seriously need to do something about the outdated cabins
friendly staff absolutely fantastic selection both at the dinner buffet and the breakfast buffet fresh and tasty two cabins with a door in between worked perfectly when one snores just in time in oslo as the boat docks so centrally
friendly staff great trip what i personally find very annoying is that the cars that arrive last are the first to leave the boat i also witnessed how a drunk german was very annoying and insulting to a waiter he resolved it well and remained friendly that should be said to the staff compliment
it is lukewarm food the tables were not cleared while we ate at breakfast have to pay for the water
my friend and i took our year old boys on this boat trip weather was beautiful water was calm and there was lots of activities on the ship to keep the children entertained and having fun we ate the buffet one night and ordered take away pizza the next both options were delicious spent the day at the tivoli and the kids had a blast we took the bus shuttle which was easy enough but may opt to take a taxi next time as its similar price as the bus when there are in your party
friendly and very helpful staff very good quality food good beds in the commodore cabins extensive selection in the duty free shop the vacation begins on the ferry
dont buy the food from home because if you get sick and dont eat what you bought you wont get your money back so buy the food on board just a good advice we lost money
were given the wrong boarding card back at our evening meal but did not discover this till later when we took the wrong card to the desk the staff member just took it the next day we went to the desk as i was concerned about someone on board having our card and accessing our cabin the staff member than said they could issue a new card why didnt the person the previous night do this in addition my husband as been violently ill since leaving the ship and puts this down to something he ate for breakfast on board
all went efficiently and we had plenty of comfy seats to choose from
i have just had chicken and chips bites of a very unhealthy looking piece of chicken and a bottle of water to cross rude staff why for luke warm chicken and chips im hungry but not that hungry
tiptop travel missed places without music
was very disappointed that their playground looked like something that was years old and nothing had been done to it were only ball rooms taken place and games on floors swimming area inside very small the rooms were fine but could have been nicer with a tv and a mini fridge wifi prices were very high bought the breakfast buffet which was a bit disappointing that it was not extra delicious food very boring fruit was only apple or pears but the restaurant was cozy and the food was delicious in the italian style the bathing area outside was really nice and nice to sit in the spa with that view the service was really nice and everything was nice and clean would say i would like it again but without children
nicely refurbished boat decent food good service
the renovated cabin was definitely more appealing than last year the breakfast buffet is unbeatable in terms of variety
check in cabins pet friendly very clean for the crossing the evening and breakfast buffet was very good
cabin placement was a bit noisy slightly stiff prices charges for a cup but a nice trip anyway
fantastic mini cruise staff on the ship were helpful friendly food was delicious and cabins clean we were lucky with the weather beautiful photos taken we cant wait to go again
everything went well the food and cabin with sea view were better than we thought wed be happy to go again
good cabin pleasant atmosphere friendly staff
the service at breakfast was appalling when i queried with one of the staff that in order to obtain a tea with milk i had to apparently order and pay for a separate glass of milk the individual taking payment yelled at me to take my complaint to the deck below i did so and his superior summoned the said individual to the complaint office instead of accepting that he had misunderstood my query and offer me an apology or any kind of redress i was told in a rather highhanded manner that i shouldnt expect that the customer was always right what an awful way to treat a customer
everything went smoothly very relaxed entry and exit actually everything was very relaxed it was never too crowded you could always find a place to sit etc tiptop
all staff were friendly welcoming and professional despite many guests the ship was perceived as spacious without crowding problems the cashier d and should get a raise extremely helpful and competent not only to me with a walking problem but to all the expeditions i saw but i waited in the queue negative my cabin needed to be tightened up in terms of paint error in the restaurants bill one glass of wine too much it shouldnt happen but of course jan will apologized but probably should have given a little quotcompensationquot
the journey was effortless everything is clearly indicated and we quickly felt at home on the ship staff are great and the food on board is of a high standard and affordable too it doesnt really feel crowded anywhere so i think there are enough facilities on board to keep everyone entertained
the friendly welcome service and clean cabins good food very well done
you are well organised clean and attentive but the person petcabin was very hot dog overheated very noisy and well used it was very cramped even for two people and a kilo dog and way overpriced i mean for just for the cabin one can expect better facilities like airco tv etc the outdoorspace for dogs was great spacious and clean our dog struggled with the two stairs to reach the facilities fantastic to have the cabin so close to the vehicle deck that saves a lot of stress for both pets and owners
everything was good except the restaurant where we were amongst the first in but the food was very tired
easy booking via the site excellent checkin and boarding friendly staff and good service so highly recommended
a very relaxed way of travelling we booked the lounge and we have been served by an very polite host he made us a very nice baguette perfect
clean cabin helpful staff well organised trip with everything accoriding to plan
pleasant crew excellent buffet a little information before the journey and under the faq for example when checkin starts if we had to change cabins on the way home little entertainment for youngsters very limited games room and most games were out of order
my husband and i were impressed the ship is great the cabin is a bit small but clean and the polish radio is great we are polish the food is delicious and a wide selection the crew is helpful and polite we will definitely come back
the whole crew is great the service is great the cabin was great the food was great the live music was great
very clean ship is new cabins are spacious with large windows very nice
booking arrival waiting times parking the car the cabin people food everything went smoothly very well organized
nice crew very tasty meals clean cabin
nice trip pleasant service good food we wanted something to eat when we got on board in denmark here you must get glutenfree food in the various eateries many who are in need of it courtesy oddmund ruud
everything went well as planned cabin and accommodation was fine
staff in seas resturant stressed and bad service dog barking from neighbor all evening and morning
a lot of noise and vibration in the sleeping cabin impossible boat seaway king deck cabin
efficient clean ship friendly staff on time
we had a nice trip to copenhagen between th and th of may with beautiful weather the food in the a la carte restaurant was good and the breakfast as well in the buffet restaurant it was a pity though that the stay in copenhagen was far too short with the ship leaving at three clock pm also we were not fylly aware of the stop in frefrikshavn but that in it self did not matter
staff was friendly the ship very crowded with noisy people on the way back the princess there was an incredible noise from the ships engine not possible to sleep on the way to uk on the king the airconditioning was to warm and no fresh air again not possible to sleep
good service at little italy nicely decorated boat may
everything was perfect traveling with a dog was super easy absolutely friendly and accommodating the food in the bistro was absolutely delicious well be back
nice and clean boat service minded staff web site is unclear doesnt show what is included and how things look explorer restaurant bad food and uninspiring environment
good food nice people good service
the rooms are small but adequate and the beds are comfortable the food and the service at the buffet dinner was fantastic
rooms too noisy little to do and unfortunately too unhealthy snacks would have liked to see more healthy choices
people taking of their shoes and snoring on the boat also the boat was being vacuumed while having dinner i am allergic to dust duty free items are not sold conversion rate to
couldnt think of any reason not to give stars until i remembered on journey out the meals were a lot dearer as we hadnt pre booked can you justify charging so much extra
so sad we had traveled from aarhus to copenhagen to take the trip from copenhagen to oslo we arrive at a filthy dirty cabin vomit in the toilet dirty bedding and towels on the floor we went down to reception to ask for another room here we were offered an upgrade to the same type of room the only difference was a window kroner absolutely ridiculously expensive we were then given drink tickets to the sky bar while we waited for our room to be cleaned when we got up there it was full of people there wasnt a single place we could be no available tables or chairs we ended up checking out of the ferry and not leaving at all because it was so unsatisfactory super sad when you were looking forward to it they really need to upgrade everything and it simply cannot be that they cannot get their rooms cleaned before new guests arrive
the irregularly laid bed cover was also a torn sheet and i did not understand why the cabin was adapted for animals you will only spend money for a simple cabin like all the others
one major shortcoming lack of activities on the ship in the evening we were expecting dances or disco but bars were practically empty also hot snacks could be selled longer
nice and polite staff god restaurant a fantastic wieu from the kahyt
nothing to complain about pleasant staff and clean boat
liked the dinner buffet at seas the playroom for children the service disliked the breakfast buffet at seas little variety compared to dinner buffet and not even fresh sliced fruit slow service wasnt served coffee the playroom for children was closed off due to painting work on the way back but there was no information on that would have been nice with a poster informing that before entering the playroom to avoid toddler tantrums
super service across the board from the enthusiastic bingomusic quiz host to the waiters we can highly recommend a mini cruise and will definitely come again
we have been with oslobden many times and every time it is a pleasure good cabins good service and not least really nice staff in
your breakfast buffet is really good the evening buffet has been better little italy is under all criticism got pasta with a sauce as thin as soup
its a pity that food at a later time could not be arranged when booking the restaurant was not full at the time we wanted customer service did not help us well and did not have the correct information in advance otherwise a good crossing
really good trip on still water eating at the italian restaurant cant call it the food tasted of nothing it was just flat we ate pasta with meat sauce and really bad service
the staff were exceptional friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble the buffet dinner was a real treat absolutely delicious so much choice and top quality
decent food small but comfy rooms only problem slow disembarkation due to passport control
on time meets expectations this also includes poor sleep narrow bed warm cabin etc buffet for dinner was excellent staff very friendly
the organisation and efficiency of both the king and princess was impeccable cabins spotless all the crews were polite and helpful in every detail on board food good value well prepared and presented both sailings on time and smooth the only downside for us was on the king with intrusive cabin engine noise and vibration level midships
we just left and arrived on time everything was neat and clean on board and the meals in the restaurant were also delicious
fantastic facilities we had a great time on board the buffet in the explorer restaurant was very nice smooth sailing temperature in the cabin was very high to warm to sleep
fabulous staff great entertainment and amazing food your chefs are a credit to you we couldnt fault a thing we had a lovely smoothie crossing there and back with amazing weather
we were lucky and had very nice weather but not so nice to have the sun in our eyes for dinner at the seas buffet there should have been some sun protection there
quality and variety of food on board below par poor pricequality ratio stuffy and very noisy cabins poorly fitting chairs all in all a poor crossing
friendly and pleasant staff good food great breakfast however the concert with kenn on queens was miserable
nice neat boat toilets were neat friendly staff everything was well organised the buffet food was very tasty breakfast also fine
had a great trip with dfds helpful friendly staff cabin was clean too entertainment on board is fine live music in the bar and a dancing waiter was quite good
the cabin on the way home was far too hot and had very poor ventilation on the way down it was fine
the staff was very friendly and helpful food both at dinner and breakfast was really good the only downpoint was that the engines are loud and on account of that many things rattle and clang in the cabin during the night
good breakfast good being greeted by staff good toilets
everything well arranged only a small downside for the a la carte dinner due to the crowds it took a very long time before we could pay
we as cyclists were treated so very well the vessel was spotless and the man in the snack bar was very nice as well
we had a great time and enjoyed good food
good mini tour with children good entertainment in the gaming room there were several machines that did not work thats a minus another minus is that on deck there are smokers everywhere which smells and bothers and there is nowhere else nonsmokers can go for fresh air in addition to this a really nice opportunity for a getaway from everyday life
everything arranged well on the way there is a cabin at the bottom of the boat was warm at night on the way back to a higher hut a lot cooler lots of time to read quietly and still be on the road
staff extremely friendly and helpful parking nearby euros per day the standard room is very small we upgraded straight away without any problems clear difference and recommended but better does cost more transfer to newcastle and back was also perfect there was nothing to complain about
dinner and breakfast were great the different time slots eu and uk were confusing staff were super friendly internet on the high seas is poor and expensive it was a shame that many of the slot machines for the children were out of order but we will definitely go again
nice experience but it was very cold in the room too bad we couldnt get to the room when we got back from our wet excursion in oslo
clean comfortable and great foodgreat atmosphere in the bar
excellent service friendly happy and helpful crew on the checkin terminal and onboard of the king seaways the cabins are recently been undergoing an upgrade new beds carpet bathroom upgraded changed amusement onboard
everyone is friendly and helpful especially when i travelled with dfds and had to borrow one of your wheelchairs for my disabled husband the food is tasty and reasonably priced
good service and always good serving by obvious waiters
everything was fine except for the food in the evening you could only choose between the buffet or the menu there was nothing smaller thats not good
pleasant trip the prices are however markedly higher than in previous years both food and taxfree
i had trouble securing my motorcycle and your two guys on the vehicle deck were great food on both journeys was good and not as expensive as i thought it would be all areas i used were clean and tidy
fast check in helpful staff both ways fair price good signage ok offer of food
clean and pretty cabin with an ok bed
wonderful trip lovely huts very hospitable tasty food amp breakfast
its too expensive on board dkk for family for dinner it does not work
i had booked a trip to we love cruise the day they were released i dont have the option that day to book allin heaven free bar x evening buffet amp x breakfast with discount im calling customer service today because my friends alerted me to this offer they just ordered the nice and helpful man in customer service is so understanding and helps to change my booking to the allin heaven discount so thank you we are looking forward to another great we love cruise
environmental profile very surprised at how little environmentally friendly profile dfds has no recycling and imagine an incredible amount of food being thrown away we enjoyed the trip but the yearold thought the music was very loud when we were waiting for the prizegiving nice with the pirate standing at the exit when we got off clean and nice in the bubble zone nice that we got in early
very good god food perfekt cabin and good entertainment
the room was small in size the room was very noisy you could not sleep well and heard cracking noises
as with the last trip we were satisfied with the service and the information the vegan food offering has room for improvement and a lot of room for improvement the way items left in the cabin are handled is questionable why are they thrown away without comment
everything well arranged we left on time and arrived on time staff helpful when driving in and issued cards with the position of your car good information about the intercom breakfast and dinner were well organized and tasteful cabins inside are a bit small but doable for night
we had to change cabins which we were not told about when we booked the trip it was embarrassing because we didnt clean the cabin so the staff had to do it we would not have traveled if we had known
all good but the woman who sang had to sing bars low and the man who sang bars
the cabin looks worn especially the bathroom and the bathroom smelled of sewage delicious food on board seas and very friendly staff throughout the ship
very helpful crew good food comfortable cabin
everything was ok however children should not be in nightclubs for example columbus until well into the evening observed until
from the start we met the kind and helpful people we felt seen and heard and many smiles and laughs from the staff in particular we must highlight amalja and victor who served us in the restaurant how wonderful they werewish we could have taken them home amalja created trust from start and made us feel like vips and we had some good laughs victor was a little more reserved but with his charm and winning personality it was a great joy every time he came by our table and served us we wish them both all the best in the future
it was good but the weather was not so good
the team of attendants on and off the ferry was great the buffets were not of good quality i cannot understand why you are not allowed to use paper in the toilets that is not hygiene
the service was top notch we were lucky enough to have a really nice waiter amalie she did a lot to make us feel comfortable we could have used one more socket in the cabin
nice clean ship staff friendly
disappointing to arrive at a dirty cabin at the reception we were told that they could not do anything about it in the piano bar we sat two adults and a twelveyearold each with a drink alcoholfree for twelveyearolds of course the waiterbarkeeper suddenly comes over and says that it is best if we dont spill on the chairs as it is difficult to remove could have understood if we had been scumbags but we werent dkk for a liter of water in the buffet dkk per person seems to us to be too much with an already high price per bottle total price of nok for pieces these are just the quothighlightsquot all in all a great trip no more dfds on us in the future
friendly employees nice information about the orca organization sufficient room but we missed places to sit and relax without the pressure to order a drink and a place where you can eat a simple burger for example with kids the restaurants on board now make the trip really expensive with a family
the rooms are super small unhygienic to keep touching the toilet lid to flush the toilet on the princess the beds watered a little better but on the king the way back it was really worthless the mattresses were sagging they were just lying on the wood and to get out of the bed you had to get over the edge the sagging mattress made that extra difficult especially if you are smaller than older
a comfortable and nice boat trip there is good food in both the al a carte restaurant and the buffet restaurant the pizza restaurant has been able to see that portioned pizza even with a clear conscience is a good enough size for two people for lunch tax free is a good and clear shop with good offers
dfds service food drink and the lounge were all fabulous unfortunately our trip to calais was slightly marred by a group of men who were quite noisy not quite understanding the etiquette of the premier lounge
the food at the buffet is not as good as before although the price has risen eg little vegetables and salad the soup was impossible to guess what was the room was cramped for the price
all arranged perfectly we were with our dog so couldnt go to the restaurants that was a shame but all fine
nice clean ship nice restaurants
good instructions enough seating en good food clean toilets
one bed was crookedslanted and the pillows are bad
i always enjoy my trip staff are very helpful when help needed enjoy the food star service
friendly and helpful staff good organization arrival restaurant and arrival destination
nice employees and nice and clean everywhere and the food was great as always sincerely journeyman erik klinge
today we returned from our mini cruise to newcastle incredibly good staff on board slept wonderfully and enjoyed it worth repeating ferdinand and sara helped us during our meal we were treated great we will definitely do this again if i could give the crew and captain more stars it would be a
friendly staff efficient loading and off loading good food
everybody is friendly helpfull food was great service great rooms very clean we really enjoyed the trip newcastle was not our thing but travel was great
allowed us early travel on outward helpful staff ships clean only slight issue was no fish and chips on return trip chicken was nice but chips hard and not that hot felt they had been under the lights for a while
friendly staff very clean cabins have very thin walls i know this didnt sleep much with the noise in neighboring cabins
everything was well organised the signage the welcome on the boat the staff is super friendly the food is excellent perfect experience
quick check in on time smooth trip good food quick disembarkation
boarding personnel food restaurants all very good
everything works the staff are nice and very welcoming we definitely recommend the quotoslo boatquot
the cabins are small and the air conditioning did not work in the cabernet so it was unbearably hot in there the hallway stank of sewage everything on the ship is outrageously expensive especially drinks in addition you can buy the same drink that is sold in the bar downstairs in their duty free for of the price but nothing is refrigerated cant recommend this cruise to anyone the band quotnat klubbenquot played music that they themselves called quotgoodnight musicquot so if you expect a party you will be really disappointed
despite the strong wind we arrived at the other side without any misery friendly and helpful staff
it was indeed a nice trip and many of the employees were really nice but there were some employees who were not particularly pleasant for example a young man who was a bartender at the columbus bar he was quite rude i had ordered and i was waiting for my drink then the bartender came and i said in a pleasant way that i have already ordered so he quoti havent asked you either thenquot he spoke danish and not norwegian the taxfree staff were fantastically nice but the bartenders unfortunately drag the whole experience down understanding that you are not nice when you get horrible customers but i would dare to say that i am a rather patient and patient person
from the moment we got on the boat the staff were very helpful the lady in the lounge was great
a great trip food excellent and staff attentive
friendly and helpful staff with excellent food in the restaurant
at least stars for the staff only stars because the organization of the parking deck instructions on the return journey was not optimally coordinated the attendants however get stars the allocation of cabins could have been better and when booking it would have been helpful to have been told exactly which deck the cabin is on when leaving the parking deck you are asked to get into your car too early
everything from the crew to the standard of food only one point and that would be to be to have signage indicating whether or not the tap water is drinkable
overpriced buffet restaurant and too little selection on the cheap
delicious food but claustrophobic cabin
i think some of the staff on the boat were not so nice
great service very friendly staff excellent food
very difficult to rate the boat in general as a lot was positive for example the service of the staff but then the quotrestaurantquot explorer what a low level they are performing twice last year and now got completely wrong starter which had to be returned main course tough dry cold overcooked beef with cold lumpy and crusty cold bernaise sauce in the form with baked potato cooked to death the most disgusting meal ive been to so sorry that this results in such bad feedback
very friendly helpful staff double bed cabin small but nice comfortable bed food was good on board we had the buffet in the evening a croissant and coffee in the morning
we had a better room than orded which was really nice dinner and breakfast both had so much to choose from checking in and going on the boat went very smooth and the staff was very helpful and friendly
the service friendliness the food was delicious the atmosphere is pleasant well organised
staff were really friendly and welcoming very clean tidy accommodation great buffets
very friendly staff and easy boarding
friendly helpful staff throughout new cabin design and fittings variety and quality of food in the kitchen in amsterdam better signage for the bus to the port needed and ideally a bus shelter would be appreciated
something had run down the outside of my toilet it was disgusting it just needed to be cleaned the breakfast buffet in seas should have more healthy items it would be delicious with a bowl of cut fruit very nice and helpful staff on the oslo boat as well as nice waiters
nice cabin bigger than expected and practically furnished with enough coat hangers etc great breakfast
the pool outside was not open then wee wass in norway
very nice personel the food was great
very worn cabins its a minus delicious food
there was a wonderful calm over the whole boat maybe because it was a monday but we were very satisfied especially the evening buffet was as we remembered it from the last time which is a few years ago
the service this time was impeccable serviceminded and pleasant waitersbarkeepers and bartenders as well as generally the rest of the staff on the boat that we came across a big plus when the rest is mediocre or bad unfortunately very worn cabins the heat in the cabin was uncomfortable didnt manage to set the thermostat as it didnt produce any effect and the ship and the cabins bear the impression of a boat that has been through quota lot of funquot decent food in an italian restaurant with a group of friends the boat gives a good party with a good atmosphere among the group of friends when the alcohol level is high and the entertainment is as quotthe danskebtenquot usually is with a cover band in columbus and a musician in the pub can get a bit boring during the dayearly evening but if youre with friends it becomes as you make it yourself
friendly staff good food and plenty to do on board
smooth crossings even though sea was choppy helpful staff good food comfortable beds
good parking instructions clean decks inside and out friendly staff good food
pleasant experience good steak in explorer
overall great experience most important the staff are all very helpful and friendly there is a pleasant atmosphere the food in the restaurant is excellent my husband says he would like a bit more variety in the menu i am happy the cabins are very good and nice and tidy but twice now i didnt have plastic glasses in the bathroom we would like a bit more variety in books for sale and maybe a newspaper one thing we do not like sometimes you have to wrestle yourself out of the car and get to where you want to be via a roundabout route
great food staff were friendly and efficient
was a nice trip across the channel we had the cheapest cabin inside with bunks it was small but was clean and comfortable dinner buffet was fantastic the good ship king seaway is starting to show her age here and there but nothing that suggested it was unsafe or poorly maintained the only quibble we had was that after dinner we wanted to find a pub or lounge where my wife and i could enjoy a quiet drink and watch the sea roll by the ship had several options but they were all playing such loud music conversation was difficult other than that it was perfect my thanks to dfds for an enjoyable trip
helpful staff ensured we were parked near the lift as my wife has mobility issues the cabin we booked was spotless and a perfect way to relax have a nap and take a refreshing shower the food and drinks on board were good value and quality
delicious food nice staff good cabins what more could a person and dog want
the cost and quality of the chips was disgusting they were unedible the support and understanding of the crew including the captain of the seven sisters was exceptional when all the electrics on my automatic caddy van failed it took an hour to solve the problem and enable the traffic to get off but the staff there were a few frustrated faces were patient as this was the first time this had happened if there is anyway to make the crew aware of my appreciation please let me know
everything went well and smooth they have nice activities on board the rooms were clean and the staff was also very helpful
like the new cabin layout not so keen on new menu desserts good but mains tepid please replace the warning strip at the last step up to deck at reception desk staircase as ruth tripped over it again would have given stars but for the hour delay getting off at newhaven due to a car breaking down
boarding goodexploers buffet brilliant
all crew members from hospitality to front desk etc were very friendly and helpful cabin was clean the restaurant on deck has a nice ambience and serves a great variety of food which was tasty the kids had a great time onboard the ship and we also enjoyed the massage chairs on deck the trip by bus into new castle town centre was short and sweet all in all we enjoyed our shopping trip to new castle and well most certainly be travelling with dfds once again
the food was really good we ate a course menu and buffet the ferry arrived and departed on time and there was a good tax free and good bars
adults and children alike enjoyed both the boat and tivoli gardens in copenhagen we tried both the buffet and the threecourse dinner breakfast and everything was good dfds can however work a little further with the bus service into the city centre
smooth crossing helpful crew meals ok but poor value fish and chipsawful hard batternot nice long delays on boardingembarkation with my disabled wife in wheel chair
most of the experience was good some bad smell in the stairs nearby the toilets
passegers aged and with helth problems place on deck cabin with no lift to decks or was stupid luckily this cabin was changed to deck for future bookings in septemger only deck or deck the redt was very good
great customer service nice restaurant and comfy cabins
our cabin was to have a view and a narrow double bed but when there were two of you there was no room for two small suitcases and you couldnt turn around on the floor space we then got a cabin with separate beds and a view the mattress on my bed was so bad that the middle was cm below the level before i sat down food and service were fine but the beds
food ok no queue if you were early great duty free prices toilets spotless and very friendly staff
friendly staff clean and comfortable cabins
i go this mini cruise regularly and i love it buffet dinner one way a la carte the other great value and great service
the ship is great the staff are polite and helpful would like glasses in the bathroom
had a really good trip with them and really good service from all the staff on board only quotminusquot was a very good tipping trip on the way home nothing to complain about
staff friendly and helpfulfurnishings and bathrooms clean buffet food really high quality
on time departure newcastle ijmuiden clean cabins great food expensive onboard expenses for drinks and shop items
could have been better breakfast several types of toppings were missing on seas somewhat dissatisfied with spear ribs strong bbq sauce and a lot of grilled spear ribs this at the restaurant
staff were very hekpful and friendly both onboard and ashore food was good and plentiful cabin was clean and adequate
the vessel has clearly been recently refurbished and the relaxation chairs were much more comfortable and clean than before the bar staff were also very pleasant and super helpful
my wife and i have just been on the oslo mini cruise here on nice and pleasant experience super nice and service minded staff i we have no complaints about anything but there is always room for improvement outside cabin we could turn the temperature up and down but there was no way to adjust the speedamount of air so even though we had turned the cold all the way up it was still very hot in the cabin as we couldnt open the window for good reasons really delicious evening buffet it was so delicious and so much good food of high quality therefore we were also a little disappointed by the correspondingly not so delicious morning buffet scrambled eggs that have barely seen an eggshell juice that has never seen the shadow of a fruit liver pt which tasted a tooth too much of liver a bit sad when we had a really good experience in the evening room for improvement in the evening we had a really fresh waiter who was sweet nice and friendly a fresh tone just the way we like it we ordered our food and a bottle of wine to go with it the waiter politely asks for our boarding card it must be said that we had received a discount on the trip so we had approximately nok extra on the card we eat our food and drink the wine and leave the restaurant as we believed in our good faith that everything had been paid for when we get down to our cabin and get to rest we are then called by our waiter who nicely tells us that we have run out of the bill for a bottle of wine back to the restaurant quite confused as we thought that everything was paid as the waiter had got our boarding card to start with i am then told that we should have pointed this out ourselves that we had money to our credit on our card subsequently i then had to stand in approx min time because the system had messed up this is in no way a complaint but absolutely room improvement remember to ask the customers how they want to pay if they buy something other than what is preordered and otherwise remember to come to the table when you can see that the guests have finished eating as i said we assumed that everything was paid via our bording card otherwise we would never have left until we had paid our outstanding besides that it was an extremely difficult it system that both the waiter and the above had to fight with when i came back later when we approached the port of copenhagen we were well informed over the loudspeakers that there was about minutes until we could disembark everyone who had to disembark on foot gathered in the departure hall of the ship time passed and the older children began to get restless and the smallest children began to cry we were so many people squeezed together in a very small area and it got very hot i dont know exactly how long we waited but i would estimate approx mm maybe a little more maybe a little less my point is just that the whole trip we heard commercials for bingo horse racing singing and music but tell a large group of people who just want to get off the ship that there is a delay it didnt quite work out waiting time always feels shorter if you know what is happening or you have a reason uncertainty is the worst room for improvement this wonderful trip was given to my wife and i as a wedding present by some of our friends they had collected money together and wanted to give us this trip together the total amount was dkk since they first try to make a gift card themselves but they cant they then call dfds and are told that you cannot make gift vouchers of more than dkk per person pcs which i cant see at all why there should be a limit on other than if the gift card far exceeded what you can book within reason but i think how complicated it must be to possibly buy gift cards for your parents where the whole family has to go since my wife and i wanted to book the trip we naturally go to the dfds website to book the trip and redeem our gift card could we no we had to call dfds in person to redeem the gift vouchers i simply cant think of any other company that has such an outdated it system that you cant decide the amount on your gift card yourself or where you cant redeem your gift cards on their website it seems completely outdated and to that extent room for improvement perhaps most of all an upgrade but all in all a really nice trip that we could certainly find to take another time again and again no complaints but definitely room for improvement
the trip itself with dfds was wonderful with friendly staff however we visited the little italy restaurant a few times and unfortunately did not experience satisfactory service here really delicious pizzas but tried their charizze where the bresola or similar was so cool that you couldnt guarantee it the waiter comes friendly and asks if everything is as it should be we mention that everything is delicious with the exception of the charuittie the waiter will take it to the kitchen in addition we hear nothing we are offered nothing else and pay full price for it all we dont think this is actually good service
everything was good good service clean and good food
we did not have breakfast on this crossing as it was cold and recycledon the last crossing food was super fresh during the inclusive crossings at covid time otherwise everything perfect
sailed to new castle several times with dfds slightly less experience this time previously staff very friendly and helpful not a pleasant experience this time meals booked at checkin both at pm upon arrival at the restaurant the hostess claimed that we had made a reservation at pm and that she no longer had a table for us after some discussion we were assigned a table in an almost empty restaurant extremely uncomfortable spot and asked to change place that was not possible because all tables were quotreservedquot however the restaurant remained empty and we were served unfriendly because the staff clearly wanted us to eat quickly and leave half an hour after entering the restaurant we were told that they were closing and we could no longer use the buffet the staff laboriously quotcleanedquot around us this time we also found the toilets particularly unsavory smelling of sewage the cabin less clean
despite the weather conditions the crew were all helpful and patient
prompt attentive service clean and comfortable waiting area clean facilities and a good breakfast only concern was the cafelounge in port in calais holding area was understaffed the one server could not possibly cope resulting in long queue i gave up on my plan to eat there
great service efficient and very friendly and attentive staff premium lounge excellent as regards service and condition ie comfort and selection of drinks and food catering service in lounge exemplary
easy boarding and a great upgrade to commodore suite although it would be great to have commodore suite available for people my year old slept in between my husband and i with my year old on the sofabed however a person commodore suite would have been even better both our evening meal and breakfast at the bistro were faultless although my little boy would have preferred some more choices on the kids menu such as chicken nuggets or pizza all in all we once again enjoyed our crossing and are looking forward to our next trip
hours late departure the food breakfast in my case is terrible like school dinners in the s fine except that
it was a pretty good experience just a couple of wee things let us down we dont expect too much from the rooms and beds but should expect pillows that are more than empty cases i did report this back on board similarly trying to sort dinner out on our return took minutes if the waiter michal had taken the time to actually listen to us we could have sorted it in two minutes its just wee things
cabin on deck was a big disappointment because of the noice level during the night we have complained and the issue has been settled
very last minute booking all passed off fine a few issues with the wind when getting onboard but all was sorted quickly rooms have had a bit of a makeover but the choice of carpet is questionable you will see all in all a good trip thank you
the customer service of the employees on board is absolutely fantastic late buffet booking is not recommended selected food offer and the food is not particularly good unfortunately a lot is left on the plate recommend commodore cabins it is an added value that is worth the money the breakfast buffet there is absolutely fantastic
easy booking good working app clean ship hospitable crew best price i good find when comparing other companies
ship was very clean cabins faultless food amazing and drink very reasonable staff soo very attentive will definitely be back
everything was clean bed comfortable food tasty
the staff aboard is absolutely wonderful very kind and very helpful better than i experienced with many other ferry companies restaurants or hotels they tend to your every need and help you with questions and in the shop i almost bought sparkling instead of still water because of the color of the bottle which is the other way around in the netherlands and prevented it because its a common mistake instead of just letting me pay my cabin was spotless and the bed very comfortable i had a normal not commodore cabin with a window but it felt like a luxury cruise food in the explorers kitchen is great i have pretty bad ibs but i could still eat a nice meal and they have the allergies listed on signs next to the dishes
great meal loved the room very comfortable the breakfast in the commodore room well done with great restaurant staff
dinner in the bistro was very good the bed was comfortable and the crossing very calm altogether a good experience thank you
really quick boarding pleasant address by captain loos very clean and no queues all areas were clean and wellmaintained quick disembarking food nice no complaints
all was well friendly staff and good food the problem is that there was a lot of noise in the corridors through the night maybe some guards could calm down the temperature in the late night when most people try to sleep
very childfriendly clean very good food at the buffet
very tasty food for both dinner and breakfast polite professional service at the reception and bar heavy cabins everything is great only ticket prices are not lowkarlshamnklaipeda
good organisation very friendly service food was very delicious and varied
a really good service and good employees and delicious food
exceptional and friendly service throughout very quick loading and unloading cabins clean food and service excellent
we complained hardly cleaned cabin we bought tickets on sale still comodore we often travel with you and are allways happy not this time
clean well maintained vessel friendly helpful checkin staff and french crew comfortable fast crossing good quality hot food
had a great time on the king meals was lovly staff out standing thank you for a great frew days
the food at the steak house was really good and really good service at seas the food was not so good the food was cold and didnt taste very good but we got good service
both mattresses in my double cabin were more or less saggy i had ordered a cabin with a tv but unfortunately was only allocated one without breakfast was ok
easy check in great cabin and good food in the bistro
everything very well organised staff brilliant ship immaculate our cabin was brilliant chice of food and quality was amazing children very well catered for great entertainment we enjoyed every moment of our adventure
the food in kitchen explorer is really good however the bed in the cabin was horrible i slept on iron spiral pushing in my back and but shame for a cabin with a price of a night
arrived on time was clean and good food
staff efficient and caring food is tasty plenty of space to relax
super nice staff all over the line good food clean and tidy all the way the beds might need a new mattress
we upgraded to the commodore balcony it was a nice cabin but too expensive ice conditions for what you get for the money the service at the food was top notch
everything ran on time no towels in room no toilets in bar areas toilets located at landings
old ship renovated well friendly staff good food in the buffet with lot of choices the entertainment is average with some casinomachines and gamehall machines we didnt see the live music the cabins are quiet and pretty clean except the staints in the carpet small bathroom and some thin watery washing cream be aware the time on the ship and traveldocument is cet and take your own showergel with you
all over the smiling welcoming staff rescued the experience for us but the first night we did not sleep one hour due to vibration that resulted in a loud drilling noice all night in the metall on one of the top bunk beds next day we luckely got to change to a new room further back in the ship but this first night obviously ruined our weekend in a great manner the next rom was silent and perfectly comfortabel but i think i never want to take the chance of ending up with a room like that again im not coming back and the staff member yelling at my year old for touching a rope was not helping either
excellent trip however two things fall outside we were a family of two of whom are children and we had booked two cabins we got cabins at th and th decks it was a bit far now that we had packed in the same bag i think that could be redone the visit to explorer was not good either we had a table at and the starter didnt come until its a long time to wait for food in addition the starter was boring deepfried quotsnacksquot and the meat was charred on the outside and rather red even though we asked for medium and not medium rare but other than that it was a nice trip
our room was clean and it fit for of us we had enough space to put our stuff the bathroom was clean and the water flow was good too the most important thing was when we asked to the staff a room for praying she gave us a conference room at deck and we can used it with peace of mind all staff were very nice and helpful
all in all it was a nice trip she who entertained in the pub with guitar and song was very good and made the trip that little bit extra what went down was the dinner on the explorer on the way down cold sauce a small black burnt piece of meat and also waited a very long time for the food worst experience ever at dfds the buffet that we then chose at home was very good
cabin had bad air it was very warm bathroom sink was clogged
very upset that we had to buy drinks when we had bought the buffet we had imagined that drinks at least nonalcoholic were included it put a damper on the whole meal
everything was really good and well organised clean cabins everything tidy food was good service good friendly staff really great
very professional and pleasant staff good drinks quiet cabin and ok food
comfortable and on time good selection of food good seating
everything important was exactly as you would hope the personnel were courteous it was however a very quiet crossing on easter sunday so not many people and everyone very relaxed my only comment for a possible improvement is on the full english breakfast served in the restaurant the food was good but not very warm and the mushrooms and tomatoes were steamed rather than fried or grilled they were very undercooked and as a result not nice to eat
it was a great mini cruice but i would like to have more time in oslo the beds in the cabins are very low and i dident sleep well it was also very warm in the cabin
quite a nice room owners suite but the downside was that the sofa bed was painful to lie on and that there was a jacuzzi in our private outdoor area with hot water and stuff which was not allowed to be used until later in the year the water bottles in the fridge were quotsoftquot and therefore difficult to open without spilling although we had ordered food in the restaurant in advance we had to pay for water for the food there were no healthy foodsnacksdrink choices in the store the children really enjoyed the boat and the program for the children the breakfast was also very good
a very modern ship attractive and clean cabins very friendly staff and good food all at a reasonable price i would definitely go back
atmosphere cabin food drinks staff everything worked
super nice staff and nice room as well as wonderful catering
i think its a shame that you cant get take away at little italy and strangely the play area is closed in the morning you need that so that the children can play
very good dinner buffet breakfast is perceived as perfectly fine fresh bread and perfectly decent things but a bit cheap feel would have liked a few more varieties of toppings and perhaps a type of coarse breadrye bread the disco area in the evening was experienced as nice and pleasant employees but the music is around decibels too low so then fewer people get out on the dance floor fewer people have a really nice and fun time and fewer people go to the bar and order more drinks understand that it can be due to passenger cabins above and below and that it can be quite full but it was not experienced like this on the kiel ferry which is probably built differently in addition to being larger
incredible and exciting visit to the city of copenhagen what really makes this trip magical is the visit to the city of copenhagen full of dynamism great architecture excellent gastronomy and incredible urban environment all or most of us chose this cruise ship for this special city which competes directly with its counterpart kiel but not all that glitters is gold some small problems can overshadow your good experience problems with alcohol people who are not careful when consuming it can lead to unpleasant situations and moments the staff is very friendly and willing to help you at all times but some waiters at the buffet can have hostile attitudes that cause unwanted discomfort overall it is a good experience to share with family and friends things that should be improved the noise in the rooms the alcohol problem the variety of music in the nightclub
very helpful staff the food was very good small things could be improved for example more than one power socket in the cabin would be nice
wonderfully relaxed easy checkin too bad we booked with people and that the rooms were very far apart the booked dinner could also be indicated in advance on which floor you could eat the meal many families were now sent to a lower deck while this could have been prevented
it was everything really good the only one you could do better is to look for some space that we could take the dog out of the car perhaps there is a way
i got really sick and still have a stomachache after the trip with the boat march to march heated food has them too which they just spread on i couldnt see that they had new dishes
the children played so well good entertainment friendly staff who told about the ship engine treatment plant water the purest oslo water good clean cabins it is so nice for us who live here in north jutland that you sail within frederikshavn after all we are already far up in norway when we land it is so nice to enjoy breakfast while we sail in through the oslo fjord
the service was friendly the staff polite and the food was great and reasonably priced as well compared with todays prices had a great day and was value for money
everything nice and smooth friendly staff clean rooms and ship would be cool if the coffee corner would have coffee with oatmilk and the bar would sell proper beer no heineken but these are all minor complaints keep up the good work
friendly efficient staff clean ship comfortable cabins good food and great choices downside was the rather poor evening entertainment
super delicious food in restaurant seas good service happy and friendly employees nice big cabin peace and quiet all night pleasant sailing really good breakfast
it was fantastic again the ship has been beautifully renovated cabin perfect bars fine buffet great service top class gangway broken but solved wonderfully by very helpful staff shop here i have the only bad experience the lady behind the counter wanted to give me the amount i wanted to pay in pounds for the value of the euros when i commented on this she was offended that i noticed i doubt if i have been the only one with her for the rest i would love to come back in may
food and time of arrival has to be earlier
good service tasty food
we had booked recliners on our return trip they were fine however a lot of noise both in the room and from the room above around midnight it became calm that is an hour before we had to disembark not very nice the food in the grill was super delicious however no soda in pepsi max the staff in the shop were very helpful
the booked cabin with a double bed is like a broom closet upgrade is extremely expensive the alternative cabin with bunk beds is uncomfortable but more spacious unfortunately the entire bathroom floor flooded during the shower the food on board is expensive and there are no alternatives because the coffee shop only sells coffee and tea with sweets nothing healthy for sale no soup or salad shame
boat entertainment and all the things are as expected been doing this stint for over year however my last two experiences have been shattered with the explorer kitchen buffet vegan options are there but plain with the world shifting into gear to eat less animal products dfds need to step it up salads look delicious but covered in cheese only warm option is curry curry and more curry one desert option also walking back to you table with some potatoes olives chips plain peas and tomatoes however everything is labelled exactly with whats in it the buffet is excellent but needs more imagination not just for vegans but for people with intolerances
everything went as planned very clean comfortable ship with excellent food all staff were both curteous and helpful
good food choice of comfortable seating well stocked shop with some good value items friendly staff and a punctual crossing
very organised boardingdisembarking too cold onboard at night though the refit looks great
i was very nervous due to it being my first time with my dog there was a very kind man on reception who took me down a few times to check on him which helped to ease our anxiety all staff were friendly so all in all would do that journey again
we have just gone on a trip with dfds pearl from copenhagen and back home there were of us on the trip of them children from years and up to and the kids absolutely loved the entertainment on board especially benjamin and mille was responsible easter treasure hunt easter fun the entertainment when you met them in the corridors when we left the ship and of course horse racing the two young people have a really high energy level and are completely in control of getting all the kids in a good mood big kudos to them for making our childrens even better than we had hoped you must take good care of benjamin and mille they are worth their weight in gold and then it didnt matter that there were sold out of strawberry drinks for both children and adults as well as sluchice on the way home when you could have pictures taken with your heroes and they also chose to sit at our table in the columbus club
i was fine until i had the chicken was sick and had the back end aswell absolutely disgusting
we are four people adults and two boys aged and who traveled with you down to kbh and back home in connection with easter we chose to save approx nok and take an inside cabin both ways but without noise we were placed on deck both ways at on friday we complain about not enough air in the cabin all four of us then lie naked fighting the heat dfds serviceperson comes to the cabin and notes that there is little air here should he say from above but there is nothing to be done now saturday morning at oclock does the air in the cabin increase again we tell the reception that this is too bad and if they cannot supply air to deck they must at least ensure that we get a better trip home monday the situation is identical we are again placed on deck no air get a new cabin at about but on inspection there is air in this cabin but lots of noise from the engine we choose to stay put have now had another night where all four toss and turn drink water wake up with a headache and didnt sleep much the ventilation system is set to maximum cold unfortunately we cannot recommend anyone to travel four in an interior cabin had expected that they had given us another cabin on the way home but we are obviously not important enough
everything on board was well organised the food dinner buffet was also very good we enjoyed
wellfunctioning ordering website everything worked according to plan wine and water bottles in the commodore fridge were hard to open so only minor problems
from booking to checking in to general organization everything was top notch stars the breakfast we booked in the explorers kitchen is now a nono the buffet has shrunk considerably and whats left of it beats any coffee shop at the station by far the coffee is weak the industrial scrambled eggs are not cooked through the bacon just looks like it and tastes like nothing no more for me in the future star that makes stars in the mix
everything just felt right hospitable and the food from the breakfast and dinner buffet was excellent
the restaurant had not registerd my pre payment for dinner took a lot of time to get the money refunded when i presented the receipt for the trip
surprisingly comfy bunk beds but the air conditioning wasnt great so the cabin was a bit stuffy all you can eat buffet was mostly very good but vegan options werent clearly marked
we have a dog which automatically put us in the dog hotel deck space was really cramped especially with luggage but the crew was amazing so helpful and kind and made the sail really easy the food at the buffet was incredible and the waiter were really kind and helped me carry the tray back to the cabin as dogs are not allowed in the rest of the ship the only thing i didnt like was to have to do the stairs to lvl where the dog toilet is carrying my dog as he is a dachshund and cant climb the stair so in rough seas it was a bit scary
it was clean and nice good food in the buffet for both breakfast and dinner there was a lot of noise at night when we had one stop but luckily fell asleep again
booking went through without asking for foodtransport services not possible to add later even if it was more than h before travel as advertised mail from customer support said sry semms something was wrong with the website when you booked but didnt want to help adding meals even if it was more then h before
big praise to the professional staff on board they were greeted with smiles and arrangements regardless of their role service staff in shops restaurants shops checkin cleaning the elvis event was absolutely fantastic many guests wore elvis clothes glasses on and looked forward to the day attention points in the room where elvis event was held there is a step down it was not marked and came as a surprise to many this should be marked so that you become aware of this you can get seriously injured smoking was under all criticism without shielding and you had to walk quite a distance to be able to see fairly sheltered here is room for improvement there were many activities missed overview of rooms and activities recommend that you lie down in the cabin an overview of the ships rooms and activities so you can sit in the cabin and plan your day
the cabin was insanely hot all night first of all the ships departure time is suitable catering satisfactory
cabin was great clean comfortable staff were all very friendly helpful bar staff very attentive service very good there could be more cocktails on offer we ate in explorer kitchen on both nights food was great on the first nightwednesday fresh hot but on second night thursday food not too good roast lambpork very dried up mac chs very stodgy dried up and quite a lot of the food wasnt very warm we went at the same time on both nights so dont understand why it wasnt goodvery disappointing we did tell a member of the kitchen crew the checkin was ok however we then had to wait a further min to be boarded which meant we literally had to rush to our cabin no time for a shower as we had prebooked our dinner then there was more delays at amsterdam so we had our time in amsterdam cut by over min or more which impacted on the canal tour which we had booked so again we had to rush to get our canal trip also we should not have to pay extra for wifi that should be included
after living more then years in ijmuiden and seen the dfds boats coming and going it was our first time with the king of dfds from ijmuiden to newcastle when i saw the black burned fotos from the hamburgers on the dfds site i was not triggered to order the food but at the incheck i thought okay lets try it once and we can tell you now the buffet was tremendous a lot of choices from different cultures very wel coocked my wife told me the salmon was made very well also a lot of main courses and sweet desserts so also back home we ordered the delicious buffet i really dont know who put the picture from the burned burgers on there own site and think truly that a better foto is needed because the burgers we saw for real were very wel made and taste also when we arrived at the ship al personal were very friendly helpfull and polite at the buffet dinner we were served by the lovely always smiling rea from the fillipines already looking at here gives you a smile on your face and also the lovely kataryna who also gave us a great time and did a very good job to overlook the tables from her guests constantly after that we went to the pub were a slinger with his gitar plays and sings the golden oldys we loved it very much also all of the other personel were very friendly i did not see one personel with a cronky face they were all politie and did everything to make our trip comfortable my wife asked for a extra pillow at the servicedesk and within minutes they brought a extra pillow to the room later one she asked for something else and also then within minutes it was in our room the personal works together as in a well oiled system thanks to the great job of the manager some off them i made it not easy when i asked them were the bowlingcenter was note you cannot bowl on a ship one of them was sharp enough to tell me that it was behind the snookertables i see complains under the revieuws that the matrasses were to hard and yes they are not the softest but we can say we had a good sleep on them maybe in years when the new boats are coming they choose for another little bit more soft matrass we had a nice small room but not to small with a bunkbed and there was also a small couch and a poof in the room and a big mirror what makes the room looking bigger the air was controlled by a system you can choose to put it on cold or warm and it works well the temperatuur in the room was good the room toilet and shower also in the another compartment from the room were clean and good looking for us spacious enough also the bustranfer from the ship to newcastle and back was very well organized one bus went back at and one at so you can choose to stay shorter or longer we went to grainer inside market visited the bridges and walked trough the city it was a lovely experience enough to do in this city all together we may say it was a beautiful experience mostley because off the lovely personel who worked as a well oiled team the good buffet with enough choices enough entertainment for a short trip like this we cannot tell you about the bistro and the breakfest because we didnt eat there yess we had a very pleasant stay everything was great well done thank you so much kings
there was no opportunity to go into the restaurant and see what we wanted to eat there appeared to be only set price meals what if you only wanted a snack starbucks their coffee is vile can you not get a decent coffee shop also i do not drink hot drinks out of cardboard cartons what is wrong with cups theyve been around for quite a while now you are travelling between the uk and holland there are superb beers available in both countries so why is there such a limited and poor choice of beer in the shop absolutely no point in buying it the pricing of most of the items in the shop was far above that of ashore so why buy anything on the ship when you could get it cheaper in a few hours bed was very comfortable and the shower was good
brilliant everything was great staff really welcoming and friendly the ship was clean and tidy
great food on board great food on board with a rich buffet and a very good and varied breakfast the only drawback is the very thin walls in the morning the alarm clocks of the other guests went off all around our cabin first on the right then on the left and a few minutes later at the head of the cabin this ensured that we didnt oversleep breakfast
allvise good service break fast could be better none freshly baked rools cold and very ceap marmelade i need good orange marmelade in the morning thank you for good and carme sailing
love the ferry trip comfortable cabin great food welcoming staff
schedule according to the stated time clean ship cabins and other apartments delicious food in the restaurant excellent breakfast professional and friendly crew my family had a wonderful time i will definitely use your company next time many thanks
no problems whatsoever boarding and disembarking quick and easy breakfast buffet excellent and good value cabin was ok but storage space very limited and quite a lot of creaking
good breakfast good dinner
the staff are all very friendly and helpful the buffet food is amazing the room is a bit small but had everything we needed
crew were great only small point air conditioner in cabin very noisy
excellent food clean cabin everything tidy and no wear and tear
reasonably slick and wellorganised entry on to the ferry very poor food always served luke warm and always cold by half way through inedible chips
good food staf and musik
check in went very smoothly cabin was clean and functional
wonderful boat roomy very friendly staff nice shop with offers
room was really good commodore de luxe right at front spacious and quiet great view out could do with separate room for use as a lounge like king seaways has not happy that gangway didnt work in amsterdam very inconvenient breakfast was fine apart from cheap sausages on leaving ship at end of mini cruise huge line of passengers using only one set of stairs to disembark staff are friendly and helpful overall would recommend this as a short break
the staff was very polite the cabin was clean the food was good
food at the cafeteria is too expensive and not hot enough baguettes at the bar are too expensive for the size lighting in the lounges too bright at night and air con is very cold new fit out is good
smiling and friendly crew nice and clean explorer restaurant little italy also food and wine st class
great experience boat has everything you need service was great and the food was excellent rooms again comfortable clean and enough room
all good just food can be better
when we arrived at port we had hour wait in which we expected the transition to get on board with our vehicle was amazing in how they are so organised in using all the spaces the ships cabins are quite comfortable and clean food in restraunt was tasty and plenty of it the new duty free shop was well stocked overall good in all ways
the service and the food on board is great
checking in was completely problemfree my wish to be placed near the elevator due to my mothers severe disability and g was fulfilled there was a toilet for the severely disabled that was also important for us the staff was friendly and helpful
upgraded to commander breakfast was very luke warm and this was at am when leaving the ship it was delayed due to the gangway not in operation and had to leave via cargo doors lost time in amsterdam and the wait to get back onboard was dreadful
great ship pleasant and healthy staff good food nice and clean in the cabin and the same with the ship
all the staff were fantastically welcoming and the meals were right in the cupboard
everything was excellent we had an inside cabin without a window but that didnt bother us at all it was clean and there was fresh air there was plenty of hot water for showering and the beds were very comfortable you could move around the ship freely whether outside on the deck or at the various events the breakfast and evening buffet were particularly great there was sooo much variety and everything was super tasty and varied the starbucks bar where you could get delicious drinks was also great the staff were very friendly and accommodating if i hadnt gotten so seasick i would do the trip again
everything is going smoothly in an orderly manner the cabin is clean and tidy you can have a good rest thank you
arrived in the cabin but it wasnt vacuumed but everything else was ready
hello everything is fine except that there is no passenger elevator from the st deck to the reception it is very difficult for elderly passengers to overcome si issuki
we had a family trip which went absolutely fantastic good food in blue riband and seas good service everywhere i would like to highlight the cocktail course and the bartender johannes who just did it really well
just got back from a trip to amsterdam all of the staff on the ferry were friendly and seemed to enjoy what they were doing the food was ok there was plenty of choice for the evening
great hospitality knowledgeable staff delicious food wonderful cabins you should mention that there is no longer a casino
the trip was fine apart from delays at the amsterdam end as foot passengers to disembark absolute chaos and we had to walk off the boat through the car exit ramps this was the same when we returned after the trip into amsterdam this is not a one of it was exactly the same last october when we went the breakfast quality is average at best
great trip food and drinks excellent and well priced boat very clean entertainment good would have been stars except for the queuing when leaving both in amsterdam and on our return to newcastle
boat spotless staff excellent disappointed that the food offering is restricted to restaurants which are pretty expensive especially if you just want a single course or something lighter bar was reasonably priced cabins comfortable and clean
on time very clean ship staff very friendlyjust one complaint the food was not very hot
overall a good experience food could be better ie breakfast
the crew on board was magnificent kind very helpful they were absolutely happy and passenger friendly specially at the bistro and the service desk
another very nice mini holiday delicious food very friendly staff already looking forward to the next trip helen jansen
the room was spacious and comfortable the meals were exceptional in quality and choice the staff were very helpful and friendly overall a great mini trip
check in was very efficient and staff were very helpful cabin was small but very clean and comfortable everything you needed for a overnight stay
unable to book on mac computer but able to on phone three computers tried but all failed to allow bookings
the king seaways has had a refurb much nicer at the back of the ship for my two dogsliked the blue anti slip matting too didnt have food apart from coffee and a cookie
we did not like that passengers were alowed to smoke every where on the deck
staff were very helpful we had lots of luggage and they helped us find a lift and exit without getting mixed up with the crowds room was good aside from a very noisy squeaky rattle in the cabin bed that we just could not damp
clean rooms really like the food on board nice staff as well im giving stars instead of because the walkway was broken and we had to leave the ship through the car deck which caused a but of a hassle
our holiday started on the boat small but clean bedroom with bathroom and everything you need comfortable beds however it does take some time to get used to the background noise of a boat particularly the engine and everything that moves with the vibrations of the engine there are all kinds of facilities on the boat to entertain you for an evening we took advantage of the evening buffet and sat in the pub in the evening where live music was played communication about departure and arrival during the trip was clear on the return trip we had to get off the boat via the car deck because the trunk for the pedestrian exit did not work but this was also well communicated very comfortable and quiet way to travel
nice cabin on deck with good beds the food was good in seas a little disappointed with the interior of the explorer it seems tired and could use an upgrade but the food and service were absolutely superb
the service was top lovely buffet both dinner and breakfast but the prices in duty free were probably stiff otherwise good
it is hopeless to charge danish kroner for a glass of tommasi red wine which costs danish kroner for a bottle at taxfree sharpen yourselves the restaurants are simply too expensive the rest is very good
we got a cabin with plenty of space and it was quiet and peaceful on the boat
great rooms excellent staff food excellent also no complaints
very good trip prices of drinks werent to bad cabins very clean shocking wait to get off boat at both ends on mini cruise took nearly hours on both occasions
the trip was overall a really bad experience with departure at the entertainment with small children was to sleep on board in the cabin the cabin location was unfortunately right above the ships very noisy night club a cabin ordered as soon as the sailing schedule opened ie in good time my wish is that you preferably place cruise guests rather than families with children in the approx cabins above the nightclub or when booking actively can opt out of cabins above the nightclub the food on board the seas restaurant pleasantly surprised and the trip home with a cabin location far from the nightclub worked perfectly
friendly staff clean cabins good organizationbus transfer good food
there was quite a long queue at the pizzeria on board on the way home otherwise it was an ok trip
went on a ferry from this company with my class for a class trip and it was great surprisingly really really good meal i had a schnitzel and chipsfries we got a coupon for either free hot meal sandwich or cake plus a drink for all meals the service was very friendly and even made jokes cleaned the desks properly and all used gloves the interior is also very clean and well made doesnt stink and comfortable made means its not too cramped i definitely recommend it
ship king seaway was still under renovation in the cabin designated to us the toilet was in the cabin in front of the bed we were immediately given another cabin with a sea view staff is very friendly and helpful dinner buffet was excellent not star but we slept wonderfully on a great bed the edge of the bed may be slightly lower than the mattress to prevent knee impacts
received nicely people are helpful the house is clean and the food quality is sufficient
food buffet just great everyone super polite just a shame that the cabin creaked all night long
first class trip by a first class company thank youthe food was excellent also
staff were great food was good ship was clean
we had a disappointing experience in the duty free shop when a sales associate accidentally smashed a bottle of wine there was no communication from her and seemed ti blame my wife although it was clearly nothing to do with her
good food in the restaurants the tax free wine is ok but it is possible to find cheaper bottles in copenhagen
the stars this time are for the service staff the guys on deck loading and the staff at checkin and on board as always friendly and serviceoriented this is the second time that the ventilation on board has been unbearable its simply running at full speed we already knew this and brought appropriate clothing with us the ventilation in our cabin was broken the staff knew this the cold warm control didnt work and turning it down didnt work either we tried to sleep in the cabin with hats windbreakers and hoodies in the end we slept in a corner of the restaurant on deck the security staff understood this in the morning we met other people who also preferred to sleep on the bench because their ventilation in the cabin was so cold covering them up or redirecting them with a bag was unfortunately not possible we decided to take the tunnel on the way back what a pity the guitarist was sensational again and so was the bartender addendum to answer from dsdf dear sir or madam as you can read above we contacted your staff on board the problem was already known and they were unable to help us or resolve the problem i travel with you regularly and i am aware of the process however if there is no one there to repair the ventilation although the staff at the service center knew about it and there are no free cabins apparently there are although we would have been willing to pay for an upgrade there is nothing you can do except sleep in the aisle we have found a way to travel via calais using the tunnel and we will do this in the future kind regards
good service everywhere we lack a quotquietquot place to be which is why we went to the gin bar here two families with children come in with children each because there were children everywhere else maybe the gin bar could have been a quiet place for adults
we liked the ample seating and the pleasantly clean ship embarkation at newhaven and disembarkation in dieppe were fast and easy but we loathed the disgusting and expensive cappuccinos over for two cups of liquid that neither tasted like coffee nor had any foamed up milk and who presugars a cappuccino
friendly staff the ship i was on looked well managed
quiet and clean boat helpful staff reasonable choice and quality of food though pricey and hot food not very hot
rooms ok facilities ok food ok
thank you for a wonderful holiday very comfortable delicious food a wide selection for every taste and good waiters clean rooms and grounds friendly staff i liked the pool the staff patiently helped me choose a bathing suit there are also professionals who work in the shops there was a good concert in the evening but i would especially like to mention the vigilant professional security guards with such security you feel safe
had to upgrade within mins of boarding the x bunk bed cabin should not be sold too a year old a a year old with limited mobility you could only get one foot on one ladder rung to climb up the cabin itself is too small too much no access around deck areas due to maintenance work however the staff were lovely and extremely helpful and the food was exceptional
a very nice experience both with food and pleasant service the only thing is noise from the engine unfortunately we were on the th deck
easy to sleep with our dog together in the dog friendly cabins the explorers kitchen prepares very good quality food excellent service too
our cabin on pearl on deck seemed worn especially the bathroom where the shower dripped and the shower curtain was wet you didnt feel like using the bath
all the crew were very kind and helpful with my assistance dog
the rooms are not big but for nights perfectly ok it was said there was a swimming pool but that is only in the summer and only when the weather is nice big disappointed at that the childrens area was way too small i didnt really understand why at dfds had to send a message over the speakers about safety arrangements i almost was asleep and after to long messages totally awake we couldnt participate a childrens program because we had ordered diner and couldnt change that it would have been better to know the childres program before we ordered everything else food at the buffet restaurant was good
great service and great staff my personal opinion is that it needs a snack bar meals are available but not sandwiches or pizzas overall good
friendly staff good but expensive cabins good wine bar we had prebooked a table for people in the explorer restaurant dkk per person it turned out to be a simple steakhouse after our booking so our expectations of enjoying a firstclass dinner made from the best ingredients with subtle flavors were definitely not met the price was way too high we were forced to three courses without proper fish and without the option of veganvegetarian food the wine list is still good the staff as well but that cannot make up for the disappointment at all over the years we have eaten at marco polo with great pleasure then ok fine at explorer but from now on it is over with us as guests at this quotjensens bfhusquot
we were a party of people aged and were very pleased with the food drink and entertainment
the staff generally seem stressed and have little energy to be friendly we stayed in a bed commodore with jacuzzi but the standard of the cabin was quotwornquot the sink was stopped and doors and locks were quottightquot and difficult to close or open
great value premium longe an polite helpful staff food and drink choice really good
hello i general the experience was as nice as my boyfriend and i made it i would like to review on different topics costumer service food quality cleanliness etc costumer service many of the host and specialky the waiters i repeat the waiters were very attentive and kind a special thank you to both the eaiters from the buffet restaurant and the a la carte restaurant specially of waiter mr edilbert who served us during our last night on the boat however a special message to the owner many of the ladies hostess from the restaurants at the starbuckscoffe place and the shops were very very rude u kind uminterested and had no costumer service at all the other hostesses on the floor that welcomed us were better but not the previously mentioned also the cleaning staff were rude unkind and or irritated sadly i did not have a good experience besides all the kind waiters the ladies from the starbucks were so uninterested in making the coffee for us the other lady was just looking at we from head to toe with an arrogant face she made the coffee for us and let it standing on the side if i didnt notice that two coffees were thwre we wouldve been waiting there the whole day because she didnt even mention it she just went along with her thing and being on her phone the other hostess from the buffetrestaurant was also very unkind we arrived there to make a reservation she had just been busy with another client when it was our turn we approached there and saig goof afternoon no response she was just looking at the computer my boyfriend and i awkwardly stood there waiting to have a reaction from here she did not even aks to please give her a minute after a couple of minutes she just asked for our boarding cards without talking just with siging with her hands told us the available hours and that is not even a greeting nor a goodbye omg the boat the looks are very old outdated and not so clean it is very rusty and many cracks on the boat and windows our cabin was too small even though we paid extra for the seaview this might be expected it was okay for was it was however ther was a weird matrass protector with a very disgusting yellow patch the decor is pretty okay not much to see entertainment the club was not what we expected the live entertainment was not thay enthusiastic the guy couldnt really sing and the lady singing was better but she didnt rwally bring any joyful energies to the crowd everyone was just sitting around and thats it the playroom was very basic but good enough we used the massage chair this was fun and relaxing we didnt go to the cinema it was and we didnt want to pay that amount so we skipped that the live guitar si ger at the oub had a very nice voice this was very relaxing we went to the slots and gambled a little bit however most of the time we were in thw cabin the duty free shop closed at pm after dinner we never had time to visit it besides the last morning like minutes before we arrived food the buffet food was mostly cold still very eatable however after dinner time there is nothing or nowhere to go to get extra snack at night because everything was closed only the club had like nachos or something but further no filling food no vendin macgines to get snacks only drinks but the a la carte restaurant was amazinggg waw we went for the scallops and the shrimps appetizers also for the ribeye steaks and the sorbet ice cream everything was perfect and tasted amaziiiing very very nice service as well thank you edilbert and the chef waw big compliments to this restaurant breakfast at the buffet was not so good or to my liking also very very cold food but nice for what is was again the waiters are very attentive and really keep the place clean it was very noticeable that there were many many filipino employees i love their service and kindness only the waiters and some floor hosts so i really want to thank them for making the difference for us in general it was an okay trip i didnt feel very welcomed by some employees but it was a nice new experience the star of the trip is the end destination new castle not so much the trip however i thank the owner for providing these mini cruises
i got a bad stomach after eating the fish chips in the restaurant
departure and arrival in time short travel time from kapellskr to paldiski too warm in the cabin not possible to adjust the temperature repeating adverstisement over the local radio to visit the shop is really annoying please announce the arrival ca minutes in advance otherwise there are at least calls to visit the shop and suddenly all the travellers are asked to go down to the car deck at the last moment
good food and things for kids
a good service for getting to mainland europe with pets our pet friendly cabin was noisy with the ships engine
the food was great yum yum
friendly staff clean cabin at the right temperature lovely places to stay without music good food in seas
could be bigger choises of food in buffet
everything could not have been better maybe round off the bed and woodwork a bit so that the elderly and people with disabilities can get in and out of the bed more easily but for the rest everything is perfect the food crew and the boat trip perfect thank you for a successful mini cruise
long time waiting for the english boarder the price for dinner buffet is quite high compared to what you get for it the cabine we had in the way back was dirty and the toilet didnt flush
always a pleasure to travel with dfds although not sure of the new catering arrangements good idea to have the food freshly cooked but by the time i got my breakfast the food was already cold the only thing warm was the beans which probably came out of a microwave not many passengers onboard being february high summer could be a problem
delicious food at the seven seas good earl gray tea in coffe brew with warm whole milk good breakfast cereal buffet good shop good selection of goods good with an offer department good bathroom cozy cabins good ventilation in the room thanks
good experience however would change the buffet restaurant to a more modern concept ie ikea kind of restaurant this reduce food waste and increase perceptions of cleaness the a la carte restaurant is perfect
great food and service our ship is getting old and extensive cosmetic work such as painting was carried out as a result many areas of the ship were not usable outside otherwise everything was well organized
we went to newcastle and scotland for days and enjoyed the minicruise with dfds from ijmuiden to newcastle the staff was very welcoming and always helpful when my daughter of hurt her enkel and i asked for assistance they were professional and helpful the food was good and there was a large variety the staff handled the big crowd very well very well organized it was a pity that lots of the games in the gameroom were out of order and that some toilets werent working well i could imagen that the special toilets couldnt handle the crowd very well at a certain point but this would be something that can be improved to make the perfect stay complete there was live music a night club with a dancefloor cinema realy nice playing corner for kids etc really nice
just good no fuss helpful staff neatly arranged we could not book a bus in advance it turned out that this was already included in the trip so that was also fine
need some new offers not giving water to travelling passengers on other decks is most bizarre policy think of new packages where passengers can stay for or more days in the destination city there is not enough options for vegetarian food
best value crossing of the channel the comfort of the recliners on deck was superb maybe you could have the area labelled as calm quiet area for rest relaxation staff in bar area most welcoming and hospitable
nice cabin delicious breakfast but annoyingly late departure from frederikshavn
my first luxury miniholiday to oslo can only say good things about this minicruise we chose commodore class with a view which can definitely be recommended we were at the steak house and it was also really good with a wide selection of wine and meat breakfast at explore was great and nothing was missing good tax free would love to come again
bad service at entrance of the buffet very rude woman unfortunately she was not the only one long lines for food or swimmingpool bad quality of food chaos to get the bus into the town center and same thing getting back ended up just having hours in copenhagen
it was a none costly trip chip tickets good food in little italy and cheap i enjoyed the tv in the room the taxfree could have more food the crew were very helpful
the staff is friendly and overall experience is actually great with exception to poor sleeping quality if youre at pearl seaways deck rear section underneath at deck is disco and the bass is strong and behind it is smoking area with lots people drinking and partying there
prices were too high on the boat euros for pepsi and only hours in amsterdam very lucky to even get a star
pros basic cost and best cooked to order steak cons late boarding for night boat hrs only in an expensive cabin significant delays disembarking boat due to design method offloading had to wait an hour for the trucks to exit
nice boat nice people who worked on board nice activities for all age groups good food too short a time in denmark
nice quiet boat we slept on deck no outside noise in the cabin you really have to look outside to know whether you are sailing or not you hardly feel any swell wind force clean but much too warm person inside cabin too small for people because there is nowhere to put your suitcase in ijmuiden and newcastle it took more than an hour after arrival to get through customs which is a shame its nice that there are so many seats outside the hut and that you are not obliged to order something everywhere buffet in explorer was great make sure you bring a nice company because it is really boring on board and the journey takes a long time newcastle is also a boring city
friendly and helpful staff clean everywhere and we all slept well dinner buffet was unfortunately not worth the price euros it is a great pity that i also booked the nd evening because the menu is simply the same it felt like hours of reheated food from yesterday not all but most of it they simply served it again i am a chef myself it really doesnt have to cost a lot of money to make delicious food i hope my next food cruise experience would be different
clean room good food and friendly staff walking off the boat took a very long time in both cases it took us more than an hour before we actually set foot on the bottom i think this can be done more effectively by for example leaving the restaurants open an hour after docking now we had to leave our rooms to stand in line for an hour
the evening meal was excellent
nice and clean cabins curtious staff
as usual the staff were courteous all along and helpful when i could not open my cabin door my fault but it was annoying that staff twice after arrival in copenhagen opened my cabin door before am because they wanted to get on with their work i was dressed and ready reading and i was off the boat well before am so no harm done but it was not all right
everything was great except the chair i sat on was dirty and a strong smell of vomit
on time clean welcoming good value and a fine pork stew to boot
clean boats but since covid the crossing price is still high my wife and i had breakfast and they were both not hot enough to eat wasted irish ferry food far superior
likes bars and restaurants were pleasant ship was clean friendly staff food was good quality and pre booking was good value for money dislikes soft drinks overpriced tea coffee and water should have been available in the package price cabins were too hot to sleep despite air conditioning unit being on leading to walking the decks at am to cool down disembarking could have been more organised rather than a free for all ie disembark by cabin number or in clusters
the outward journey had no play area just s room with nothing to do staff at restaurant very helpful but kept saying to go to the back as they didnt have it at restaurant on return journey no decaf coffee
expensive ticket and expensive buffet at seven seas the price does not match the quality of the buffet no place to sit comfortably
very polite and welcoming staff from the lower to the upper decks
we took the mini cruise from holland to newcastle when we checked in we were pressured to book food we said it was too expensive for us and that we would rather buy something on the ship and not book whole menus in advance the lady then told us there was nothing to buy that shocked us we had never experienced that before there is always a shop or caf no she insisted and that is how the disaster began we then booked food at outrageously expensive prices ps the food was more expensive than the whole trip we got on board and lo and behold there was a caf where you could also buy something to eat from cakes to biscuits to croissants everything was there it was simply a lie that there was nothing to eat then the time came for us to go to the dinner buffet and get something to eat for ourselves and our son and then the following happened the sons fries were peppered not just spicy they were brutally spicy he cried he had never eaten spicy anything in his life we were furious and looked at the buffet again no sign of anything so we went straight to the cabin with the little one and tried to calm him down with lots of sparkling water and distraction my wife went upstairs especially to look no sign of anything no sign nothing on the chips so neither of us had eaten anything but we paid for nothing i would also like to point out that drinks are not included with the meal not even water the ship itself is very very old and its best years are long behind us you are happy when you arrive and can finally get off we have never experienced anything like this with any other company we have been on many many ships but the dfds king seaways is the worst ship it is not cleaned very old from simply out of date you notice it as soon as it gets a bit wavy it rocks a lot the technology is too old and there are no modern stabilizers in short our conclusion the dfds company tries to get as much money out of the customer as possible without providing any service in return the best thing was when we were in newcastle the cabin was cleaned our old towels were taken away and no new ones were put down so we couldnt shower because we didnt have any towels the whole thing was just a disaster the breakfast was very very limited advertised as a continental breakfast there were types of fresh sausage and types of fresh cheese bacon and beans roast potatoes and vienna sausages a real shame weve had better experiences everywhere
had a comandore cabin where the tv didnt work and the toilet seat was loose the buffet was just right with dry meat breakfast was good not possible to get coca cola on this boat big minus
friendly staff good service a lot of entertainment for kids an easy way to go on holiday
cabin there should be quiet zones perhaps family areas where it doesnt matter if tge kids scream all the tine or if they run up and down the corridor
the toilets at the dunkerque terminal were in a poor state neither the ladies nor the gents had hot water decent soap or means of drying our hands a large toilet roll was on the side that was all very disappointing
the beds were very worn and the top bunk leans out so it feels like you are going to fall out its a bit of a lottery when you get a seat at their italian restaurant pizzaria but the food is excellent there and suits well if you have children with you
the staff were super nice both on the way out and on the way home resturent seas can clearly be recommended but the beds in the cabins are extremely poor on the way out the mattress was completely finished and on the way home it was so hard that you might as well have been lying on the floor now we have traveled with the same boat for the last years when we go on a ski holiday in week and it has been the same every year it cant be right that you have to choose a commendore cabin which is only for people in order to sleep properly
we were welcomed kindly and warmly to the evening buffet by a female employee butler who seemed very solutionoriented and efficient but at the same time calm and in full control never before have we experienced such a nice friendly and calm reception at dfds take care of her and the other employees little food and vegetables to choose from a few cheeses and dessert soft ice top panned plaice the cabin was clean with a nice new carpet but worn out bad mattresses and pillows delayed in to copenhagen but the shuttle bus left before the scheduled time as soon as the bus was full never before have i been so satisfied with dfds staff at all levels
lovely crew helpful smiling patient attentive welcoming felt pressured as a commodore guest you can order breakfast in your room and you have wifi the television it was also very good to be able to get back on the ship after only minutes in oslo close to the ship in oslo there is a delicatessen shop bought the best grilled salmon melts in the mouth the food at explore and italia restaurant was also absolutely fantastic and as lactose intolerant there was no problem getting delicious food thank you for a lovely relaxing trip
what we liked was the cleanliness on board and the staff were all helpful and pleasant the negatives was the food mainly breakfast choice was good but standards were not and needs to be addressed also food prices are very high so also needs to be looked at
we had a wonderful trip on pearl seaways we went as a family with two teenagers and the lack of a larger table in the cafe area where we could play our brought board games in the evening the small round tables that are there now are just small enough if you have to sit people around and play a game
kids had a great time but no need to buy kids package both ways once is fine
the personel is very pleasant and helpfull the ship is clean the shop has good deals nice variety of restaurants
friendly staff quick and easy boarding
all very good food excellent breakfast plug in cabin not working needed to press hold in tried with plugs also would be nice to have sockets should be free wifi
nice staff providing a good service childfriendly trip
nice clean ship with friendly efficient staff however the ship was very cold with the air con at full blast everyone had coats and scarves on shame also that seniors could not book online but had to phone france to get their discount good choice of menu comfortable seating duty free well stocked
we were impressed with the level of service in your premium lounge and the only thing to mark this down was the fact and a very important one that on a crowded boat there was only one cubical in use in the ladies toilet
everything about our experience was wonderful we booked a dog friendly cabin for foot passengers and prebooked our evening meal and breakfast with helpful staff the cabin was great and the food was superb the only thing i can think of that could be improved would be a bigger area for our dog but other than that we thought value for money was superb thank you for our mini adventure
service in shops and restaurants quality of food ok
a very tasty dinner fast loading and unloading of cars the cabin walls are too transparent couldnt sleep because of the sounds coming from the next cabin talking snoring and a couple who were making noise for half the night car alarms which had been left unset during the ships journey were constantly heard from the car deck the ship could remind drivers of this drive the next day approx km is quite difficult after a sleepless night
liked that there are several choices of restaurants the breakfast is not very cozy i wish that all the food was gathered in one place and not scattered in different places more selection of childrens food could be nice the rooms also need an update especially the bathroom in fact the whole room could use a facelift
pleasant staff and service great breakfast at the commodore restaurant
the sailing was fine we had pizza for lunch when we got on board and they were really good for the evening we chose the buffet restaurant and it was really poor almost no salad and what was there was boring and bland very floury peas on the soup it said ask the staff i was told it was a potato soup but it tasted like a favorite sauce which it also looked like had the appearance of having been poured out of bags badly arranged the price did not match what we got we were adults and we will not eat there again therefore the stars as it dragged our experience down that the buffet was so poor and expensive
we got a cabin on the th floor it was freezing cold even though we turned it to maximum heat we complained about it and switched to a cabin in the th which was warm thank you for good service
everything was organised smoothly food and service was very good
god service smilling personale very god food and wine
great amenities on board staff all lovely and helpful and was pleased to be able to bring my dog on board who stayed in a dog friendly cabin with me
check in great quick and easy as was the management of the queue only one thing not quite right the boat wasnt busy so space was cut back no problem but the breakfast plates were cold and a cool english breakfast is not cold plates speed up the chilling process whenever im served hot food my hands go direct to the plate cold dont work guys
passports were stolen from our locked cabin the boss claimed it couldnt be done but it happened anyway furthermore it was not possible to have a glutenfree breakfast
the waiter in seas was grumpy and very unhelpful at dinner missing fried eggs for breakfast our type of cabin is not particularly good not enough space
the trip left nearly on time and arrived only fifteen minutes or so late on board the service was good the choice of hot food was varied and tasty disembarkation was rather laborious and slow although very unusually the delay at customs was not as bad as expected the new refurbishments have improved comfort for passengers
i paid for commodore class rather than just standard it was more than times as expensive and we barely got any extra luxuries room had a window which was nice but there were plenty of window seats everywhere else on the ship apart from that breakfast was included and there was a tiny bottle of sparkling wine in our room that was it that was all the luxury commodities for x the price compared to a standard room wifi was supposed to be included as well but the room was too far away for it to work for such a high price id expected a bit more than that cruise was generally fine multiple bars and restaurants with fair prices but upgrading to commodore class isnt worth how much extra they charge compared to a standard room
the staff were nice and friendly as last time the food in the buffet was average while the breakfast buffet was fine the door to the bathroom had a quotscreamingquot hinge missing toilet brushes and the temperature fluctuated a lot in the room the entertainment in the bar next to the columbus club was somewhat below average the new band in the columbus club sings well but there must be a little more quotpowerquot in their performance there was good information about a lot of wind and waves from the staff as written earlier taxfree is a term that applies to those from norway almost only cigarettes you save a little on this part has not had anything to do with dfds for those who have not tried oslo before be aware that sunday up there is like the st new years day in the old days here cozy but quiet and almost everything closed
nice food nice cabine and most of all nice staff
comfortable and clean cabins very tasty food at a la carte restaurant
staff are always efficient and very friendly every time we cross both ways food always good to excellent in all ways
we were looking forward to our long weekend at dfds but it was completely different the first shock we got when we open the room we have never had such a small one before for a day cruise and that at almost nok for a room no tv poorly cleaned room hair on the bedclothes tired bathroom no small towels etc we went down to reception and asked if we could get another room but it didnt work selection at the buffetcould be much better we will def not back
there is no area where you can enjoy your sandwich and enjoy the sailing trip rather than having to sit and eat in the cabin
we booked a cabin for both outbound and return leg of our trip there was terrible noise on the outward leg but it was nothing compared with the return leg where workman were drillingrefitting cabins which sounded like they backed onto ours i raised it with the lady at reception and she apologised and said it was emergency repairs to beds i recorded some of the audio as it was that comical i had to drive for five hours between and am once back in the uk so this was a huge problem for me it would have been better to have slept in the lounge were it not for the horrendous noise in the cabins it would have been five stars ultra clean great food polite staff and efficient experience take ear defenders if booking a cabin i guess
very good quality of food in the evening restaurant and at the breakfast
i make the trip every couple of months and this journey was no different the staff at the port and on the ship are excellent the food good and the seafarers kitchen and the north sea bistro were excellent as usualsecond to none the onboard staff are so friendly and helpful as usual
everything is correct and well taken care of dinner and breakfast are fine wine perhaps a bit on the expensive side but good
i felt well looked after as a solo traveller the staff at dinner were very accommodating
great staff clean and calm cabin
staff always friendly and helpful food carefully balanced and well presented
the entertainment in columbus club the food in little italy the service in the coffeeshop
in short nice cabin we had a sea view and good food
fast loading and off loading quick check in courteous staff a reasonably priced good quality hot and cold menu from the restaurant with a decent selection for breakfast lunch and dinner mains starters and sides with good portion sizes for hearty appetites cabins are warm and clean general seating is plentiful even at busy times with lounge seating recliners and tables with chairs throughout a bar and duty free shop are available during the crossing
excellent staff very easy boarding food quality and cost very good
fantastic great value for money ship was spotless and the crew were so polite and helpful i ordered a bottle of champagne to be in the room unfortunately prosecco had been put in not a problem replaced very quickly and with an apology good food in the bistro restaurant was brilliant amazing choice and a very high standard and again brilliant staff cabin was as expected warm comfy beds and slept well duty free had a good choice n great price cant wait to do it all again
comfortable cabin had everything you would want for an overnight stay only downside was poor sound insulation between the cabins good facilities on board smart decor and some beautiful old ship models breakfast was good too plenty of outside deck space to enjoy the fresh sea air
there were of us on the new years cruise food and cabins were ok but the experience of a good new years eve was spoiled by the proceedings after dinner where entertainment was arranged in the columbus bar there were just no available seats and even from standing room it was impossible to see any of the entertainment which thus did not become part of our experience we had to find free seats in a boring coffee shop to be able to sit together the fact that there was no space in the columbus bar was due to the fact that the entertainment was available to all the ships passengers and that there were no seats reserved for the cruise guests it was so to speak quotfirst come first servedquot this in and of itself is reasonable but it is not reasonable to sell the new years cruise as a package deal with good food and subsequent entertainment i have informed dfds of my considerations but of course the process could not be changed this post should only be seen as a warning agree expectations before planning a cruise i will not buy a new years cruise again
on the way to engeland something in the cabin makes a strange sound the hole night we almost dont sleep on the way back to holland the temperature in the cabin was so warm we put the fan on cold but still really warm in the cabin
if the cleanliness of the cabins had been better it would have been stars cleanliness is better in common areas
food is served then you queue for drinks and to pay coffee machines serve good coffee but so slowly there is only ever one slow till point this means that the food is cold and congealed by the time you get to sit down microwave provided but this is not really a solution
very good food and the crew on board were very nice and servicemlnded nothing was impossible the only sad thing was in the lighthouse winebar in the evening was a large group of offduty crew from crown seaways talking loudly and drinking large amounts
service onboard was great however during the return we had to ask the reception to change our towels refill toiletpaper etc since housekeeping was apparently nonexisting the winter weather meant that you werent allowed on most of the deck for a scandinavian liner i hoped they had anticipated icy weather and had made arrangements to cope with it there are no indoor panorama options so you had to share the small aft smoking deck for an outside view the panorama deck was closed for most of the trip there were mold in the shower in the cabin which i found unacceptable even on an ageing ship
there is better info about the deck number and elevator very good helpfulness from staff prefer a cabin on a higher deck without stairs we are both years old
the staff on board were absolutely fantastic in a good mood smiling and professional the ship has everything you need and the cleaning was good the commodore cabins were fine despite a tough sailing home to kbh it was just a wonderful trip that i want to do again
everything was okay except i upgraded to a small double bed but you can literally just lie there its really cramped so theres no room to walk and they can make more options for dinner and the breakfast was great
service was perfect just a pity that a drink was not included with your meal
we visit restaurant explore to get some delicious dinner it was diapointing
good food pleasant service clean and tidy
we always choose to go in the premium lounge as we can relax and enjoy a cup of coffee or even sometimes a glass of prosecco it is a shame that the price has gone up quite a bit but we have continued to use this service i dont normally do a review but our trip back from dunkirk to dover yesterday was an exceptional trip the lady maria who looked after us was extremely friendly and ensured we not only had a glass of prosecco but sandwiches as well very impressed
thank you for giving me the space to speak my mind first the language why is it not norwegian secondly there are no activities for children like on other cruise ships third why isnt there a tv and fridge like on other ships
courteous staff efficient boarding and clean boat
reception staff is extremely rude unhelpful and unprofessional
extremely friendly and helpful staff both on the boat and in customer service at the office great cabin small but comfortable beds and very good buffets so worth repeating
i take medication that reduces my appetite but l had to pay for buffets and breakfasts because my wifecwanted to eat even though l did not eat it seems a little unfair for people that are ill and have a medical condition and then to be told that l had to pay for hot water i went back to the room very dissatisfied when arriving at amsterdam there was no one to show us where the right elevator was it was the cleaning staff that helped boarding was no problem
boarding went well arrived on time no hand soap in any ladies toilet food was cold by the time you got coffee and paid for it not good value tv was showing old news footage in french no i detest for english
got upgraded cabin without discussion easy booking process easy checkin few people on board ie no queues anywhere good quality of food and drink nice staff in the restaurants we ate the buffet at seas pleasant in the northern lights bar good quality good wine expertise in the bar minus a bit quotembarrassingquot magic show slightly poor cleaning of the cabin and rundown bathroom
overall fairly good but the catering is not good now it used to be good but has deteriorated in the last months
nice relaxing trip was a little disappointed in restaurant explorer though was expecting a culinary experience but was disappointed would recommend using the buffet restaurant instead
food pizza not baked heat in cabin impossible to bring temperatur down shower did not function properly
hii used the services of your company in december and january and i wanted to say that i was disappointed with the premium lounge service ie when we sailed to france we found excellent service a large room plenty of space and sofas to rest and we even got breakfast but i must unfortunately we didnt get it at the same service on the way back the room was definitely too small for everyone and we got a small sofa for people and chairs so it wasnt any premium relaxation and i expected more of it on the way back because i was tired after a couple of hours of drivingit wasnt worth the price
efficient and friendly i appreciate the border control and the weather is out of your own control to be fair they werent grumpy but just slow however the duty free and toilets at dunkirk didnt smell too good and there was no toilet paper
efficient and friendly service on time good food comfortable cabin
my girlfriend and i went on a minicruise on pearl seaways on december which was supposed to be a nice relaxing girlfriend trip from everyday life but ended up as a disaster we were supposed to eat the christmas buffet at seas but the food was ice cold and we complained to the floor manager who checked the temperature and it was not right at all on any food everything was put in cold gastro trays as an excuse we were given drinks on the house and a breakfast buffet to go with it however we never got that far my boyfriend became ill an hour later and had to suffer until the next day on the journey home it first went really wrong he had breathing problems and we had to be evacuated by helicopter to a hospital in norway where they say he has food poisoning we are promised transport home and a brand new journey with a luxury cabin with everything paid for as compensation but now the entire crew on board denies what was said and we lost money in the cabin we would not recommend eating the buffet at seas therefore check that the food is hot and especially that the shellfish are cold as that is what he got food poisoning from if there is anyone who should come across something similar so get it all in writing because they dont keep their promises in the end
there was a lot of noise people drinking and shouting outside their cabin for a long time although other people asked them to be silent they kept going so we didnt sleep well at all
staff was friendly the boat neat and clean more than enough choice during dinner and breakfast buffet slept well on deck even though we had read that it would be noisy there had a very nice mini cruise with a visit to newcastle everything went smoothly customs the bus there and back we are very satisfied
food was fantastic staff very accommodating and well mannered
on time friendly staff reasonable food easy booking on line
the fruits in longe was rotten there is no stuff for vegetations
everything neatly arranged prices on the boat are not ridiculously expensive food in the buffet restaurant is tasty and plenty of choice minuses music in the evening is really bad no fun dancing andor entertainment music bingo was really bad not a nice show or more extensive version with rounds was ready within minutes
clean and tidy food not the best
we had a fab time but was really disappointed that we didnt get to see any fireworks on new years eve and on this night we had paid extra for al carte expecting to pick something from the menu as had been told by the staff on the service desk but when we got there it was a set menu that me and my friend didnt like anything on set menu would give extra thought about doing it again a bit disappointed
staff were excellent i have seen fatter pancakes than the pillows you get though
before brexit we could always take our own food but this is now no longer allowed taking the cost for a family of up by euro for return crossing
ship was great food was good everyone in ship staff was very friendly and helpful i recommend it for everyone great experience
i had a good experience for a first timer but it would be nice to have had a choice of rolls and sandwiches has well has the hot meal but would give stars
hi good cabin good food and beautifully decorated ship
super efficient checkin and boarding pleasant staff both in the shops and the restaurants woke up in copenhagen refreshed and ready for the day
sailed with pearl in commodore cabin with sea view double bed super nice cabin included is dinner and breakfast buffet per person seas is in no way worth the money included in the total price really bad experience paid extra for an extra large ribeye french fries were to be served with that i doubt the meat was a ribeye boring and burnt fries boring and barnaise in no way homemade was offered to get new food but the appetite was gone we will not eat there again the service was good and smiling the breakfast buffet in seas was delicious little italy is a super delicious place to eat the service here is absolutely also good and smiling
everything went as planned in spite of the weather
very well organised friendly staff clean facilities the food options could have been better healthier
willing to book a cruise in june and it says that if you book a premium cabin breakfast is included in the price but it is not stated anywhere when you book why in addition to ordering the evening buffet do you also have to order the breakfast buffet we were so confused that we completely failed to book we have received help thank you
was a great evening everything was perfect on board only the cabine was not so good towels with old blood asked times for handsoap and in bed more thans hairs from someone else
the ship was lovely staff very accomadatingfood in the resturant was very goodthe new years eve buffet very dissapointingno champagne as was advertised in the bookingdissapointedthat we didnt spend new years eve in amsterdamno information to say that ansterdam is not really suitable for people with mobility issues due to the cobbled streets and steps going into stores shops etccommodore suites on board ship are very goodexcellent staffvery helpful staff getting on and off the ship with a wheelchair nothing too much troubleon the whole a good weekend
really friendly staff comfortable cabin and surprisingly good food
the staff went out of their way to be very helpful friendly assisted in every way possible the food was plenty full cabin was clean and well presented
the ferry was easy on off clean and generally comfortable i think the warm food could be improved given the size of the kitchen there is great potential to make really decent food and i am sure more people would eat onboard i am always left feeling somewhat deflated by the presentation and the quality of the food on offer
good service on the boat i chose quotlittle italyquot when i was going to have dinner amazingly good diavolo pizza which i was able to order without black olives
boarding was efficient cabin was clean and comfortable good value
i found the trip itself to be pleasant the only thing that bothered me were the other guests who were talking loudly on the phone late in the evening or at night in the area of the adjustable recliners clean toilets varied food on offer
service was good unfortunately i got seasick on the way there it was really noisy in the huts this time despite that the kids enjoyed it hopefully we can make another trip next year
staff all wonderfully helpful and polite food excellent and varied including drink with meal gives positive vibe company sensibly flexible with changing venues or times even when not due to bad weather makes travel a pleasure
despite a rather rought sea the trip was as pleasant as one can hope for under the circumstances each member of staff we had contact with was both helpful and very professional the only negative development we have perceived is that the qualitychoice of food on board has deteriorated in the last couple of years while the prices have gone up this was a slight disappointment as we would have expected one of the developments but not both
the cabin was too noisy to have a proper rest i know that dfds has matresses that dont hurt the back so much
the weather is unpredictable of course hour delay no communication regarding it staff inconspicuous why toilets only one open on a very crowded boat chris savory
it was verry good and the crew where super friendly and kind the food breakfast and diner where super good en looks extremly dillicious i als give compliments to the chef who cooked our meals en breakfast we slept wel only the boattrip to new castle was a verry bumpy ride and i got sick never had that in my whole life before but it was a verry stormy and windy day so nothing to do about it and the captain even said sorry for the bumpy ride greetings from us and we wil go again in the future
professional staff managing the boarding process friendly service from everyone on board from the coffe shop the restaurant and the shop smooth experience from beginning to end a real pleasure to travel with your company
the food was not very good new rule hour of eating we dont need that because we arent food abusers
not super impressed ober commiford class looks old and worn out nice common areas restaurant has too low level
the food and service are absolutely superb the mattress in the beds is bad the pillows are too small
the food was good it was a long cruise and the beds were really bad
good service pleasant staff good food clean rooms and common areas
friendly clean and the food was good we arrived alot earlier planned and we were booked on the earlier boat which we were really grateful for
good service nice christmas food on their christmas eve
nice food nice cabin friendly staff all in all a lovely way to spend christmas eve can only recommend it
the rooms were not cleaned well there was dust everywhere the shower is clogged mini cruise has little information about bus schedules where to get off and where to go you should always ask for directions too few links
nice food good service but the cabins need renovation quite worn the other times we have had commandores but they were unfortunately sold out next time we will only go if these are available time we celebrate christmas with dfds
i appreciate your accuracy the friendliness of the staff from the counter where you present your ticket to the bar and restaurant staff and i like your ferries only one complaint the food fish and chips is fried food that is very harmful to your health there are no good and delicious french things
all the staff i interacted with were friendly and approachable from the men directing the traffic onboard to those staffing the cafe all genuinely pleasant and welcoming which is exceptional i invariably arrive tired out and the friendly atmosphere that ive come to expect really helps
it stormet not so much the staf was nice we was a bit delayed byt it was ok i could wich that parents could keep their children from running in the cabin aereas
all went well including the sea state
all around great experience specially for the kids it could have been if i knowed about the sale on boad before departing good sales on clothes and bags it could also be nice if meat in breakfast was halal and in the buffet at seas but definetly a cruise i will book again
the staff is very smiling and welcoming the christmas buffet was nothing special not exactly poor but just ok the breakfast buffet was uninteresting and also only just ok outboard cabin with window was really nice bars limited selection at very reasonable prices the ship itself is well furnished well maintained and well cleaned
booked a commondore cabin with sea view as we sit by the window we discover a lot of stains on the sheet we lift the top mattress topper and there are further stains and long black hairs on the sheet we had ordered food from seas unfortunately the quality did not live up to the price the potatoes were hard and some food had clearly been left for too long we had booked a table for when we arrive we are told that they have written the wrong time on us and we have to wait because the waiter who was supposed to serve us is downstairs smoking so we stand for at least minutes waiting even though we had booked a table we were down in the spa where sitting alone are clearly doing something sexual an employee comes in and tells them that there is surveillance it was unpleasant to experience when you just wanted to relax in the pool area and you got the experience that the water was dirty when there was no better monitoring of this kind so that it could be stopped faster
the boat and cabin met our expectations and the childrens entertainment was of a high quality making our trip with the kids enjoyable unfortunately our experience of the staff was mixed while some were friendly and accommodating unfortunately there were several that did not live up to service expectations one unfortunate episode included the attempt to order childrens drinks where the bartender asked me to tear off the note even on the childrens card and subsequently reacted inappropriately to the broken notes which unfortunately negatively affected our experience unfortunately the experience with the childrens drinks was further burdened by an unprofessional interaction with the bartender after following her instructions to tear the notes off the kids cards we were met with condescending comments including an inappropriate characterization as quotidiotquot this unfortunate encounter contributed significantly to a less than optimal experience for our family
as a rule i did not expect to get vegan food on the danish boat but after confirmation both from the dfds website and through an email with customer service where i was told that there were a good number of vegan options on board especially in the buffet i refrained to bring a packed lunch this time fortunately one of the employees in the buffet told us that there was little or no vegan food in the buffet before we ordered on board and it was luck that we did not believe the email and the website and booked a table in the buffet before the journey we ended up at little italy both nights we got the same waiter both times and he seemed annoyed when we asked about the vegan options they had the websites ask travelers to contact the restaurant staff if you have allergies or restrictions and which pizza could be made vegan something we got tips from an employee in the buffet the other waiters who brought the bill at the end of the evening were very nice the staff in the cafe were also very nice and there they actually had a vegan sandwich the music quiz and bingo seemed like the only activities for adults the music quiz was probably the highlight of the boat and the man who ran it was very clever and pleasant again i dont expect all places to have vegan options the problem arose when i and the group were informed about something else in advance especially when there is little else to do on the boat but drink and eat not worth the money unless you got or won a free trip and bring a packed lunch its a lot of money to spend on mediocre food and a boring trip other minor things which id normally ignore but which detracts when everything else was so bad there was an alarm going off on the car deck just below our stateroom all night both nights the cabins only have one socket which makes it a bit complicated when several people want to charge their mobile phones at night almost half of the games in the arcade were out of order poor ventilation and changing temperatures in the cabin no matter how you set the thermostat probably wont travel with dfds again
breakfast and dinner were very good and the staff was very friendly too bad the beds were rock hard and the hut was very noisy
we have had a lovely trip in the city of oslo but on the boat itself the mattresses are terrible the hot food was not really hot the music in columbu was nothing to shout about we dont understand that there has to be a longwinded childrens show until pm delicious breakfast and incredibly sweet staff
very organised however it could be better in terms of entertainment on board so boring all was about making money after all even though we had already paid the cost no wifi no drinking water a bottle of water cost a fortune no drink with the paid buffet
left on time in fact advanced my booking by hrs ahead of scheduled one at no extra cost food had a restricted choice and was expensive staff courteous duty free was not noticeably cheaper than uk shops and less choice
clean cabins pleasant and serviceoriented people at all levels nice lounge with snacks and drinks delicious breakfast and good atmosphere good selection at the christmas buffet with delicious dishes of all kinds professional waiters with a positive mood and good energy
it was a wonderful trip and wonderful to feel that the staff do what they do with pride the only downside was a very dirty champagne glass in the cabin luckily we didnt have to use it
very good but the food is expensive
as always everyone and everyone was perfect if we could just get a breakfast on the ferry it would be exceptional
the journey on board always goes well the food is good and the staff is nice and helpful the ships themselves are in urgent need of an update lots of deferred maintenance beds are very tight bathrooms smelly time for a thorough update
everything was clean and tidy overall it was very pleasant and comfortable the staff were friendly and helpful it would be great if they would soon offer power sockets so that devices could also be charged
as usual tjhe ship was clean anxd comfortable crew vert helpful excellent choice of food in the self srtrvice restaurnt also a visit from pere noel
just come back from a short amsterdam trip its was an amazing weekend staff on board were so polite and helpful food gorgeous and plenty of it beds comfortable and shop very clean lovely ship and i heard it was going for a refurb var park advertised at north shields for per day but it was actually all in all super weekends def go again
the christmas food was cold the potatoes were cold the bed in the cabin was not good it creaks and it hurts to lie in it when you pay nok for the trip there should be some quality in the bed and the food
friendly and helpful staff nice clean cabins the only thing i missed were a few cups in the regular cabins
it was by no means as familyfriendly as you write on your website none of the restaurants served familyfriendly dinners furthermore the restaurants are on the same deck as the bars which meant that people tumbled drunk around our children when we had to get up for dinner at which as such is perfectly fine but not particularly familyfriendly bubblezone wasnt open until after pm and so its really hard to entertain your kids on a ferry fair enough that the pool only opens at but the playroom can open at in the gaming room out of gaming machines were broken the breakfast buffet was really good as the only positive thing about the trip
staff were friendly and helpful cabin was very clean service and food in north sea bistro was very good missed the presence of a luxe lounge on return journey
at the christmas buffet there was very little control over things the tables were not cleared and if the waiters finally cleared a table they just collected the used ones on a few tables so that the rest of us could sit next to them and look and smell why take dont they take the used stuff out when they go back and forth anyway way too much pressure on the few places to eat on friday evening and on top of that the cafe was closed early so you couldnt even buy a sandwich the breakfast was good and luckily you had bought a ticket to gasbox they were really good and elevate the experience to stars
the staff at restaurant italia was really not service minded we chose to leave there due to an unpolished waiter unfortunately it was not the only waiter who seemed tired of having to serve guests and in general i must say that the prices of the food in all restaurants do not corresponds to the quality with the prices which are on the high end we like to pay money for quality but i didnt think that was the case we would have liked to come again but really didnt think it was worth the money all of us had a good concert experience and everything staff included except for the waiters did their best thats the feeling were left with
had a table at seven seas at several empty kegs probably high prices nok is nok for a pressure pot of coffee approx cup small selection of cigarettes and heavy
nice to have a pet friendly cabin but cant leave the dogs alone as they get too stressed the person next door to us left their dog alone and they were howling and scratching the door maybe if there could be a pet friendly part at the bar or have something near the pet friendly cabins
very helpful staff we got a lovely upgrade quite cheap at the commodore de lux the lounge were lovely the room was lovely it was quite dirty under the sofa though with sweets and rubbish that wasnt ours everything else was clean though it would also be good with an option for ashtray at the private balcony the included breakfast was amazing
pleasant journey pleasant service and good food clean cabins
excellent crossing everything was well organised food was tasty and good service
the service telephone accessibility helpfulness of the staff and the meals are much better than pampo however the ships and therefore also the cabins are outdated therefore less hygienic and of poor quality the bathroomtoilet and the beds really need an update
very nice people clean accomodation good food only one thing the coffee at the breakfast was not very good
i am very glad that i chose dfds pleasant staff delicious food comfortable cabins
as always a wonderful experience the new route with two less hours in oslo drags it down a bit and the waiter the italian gentleman at little italy was super rude to the guests completely wrong dining experience but nothing to blame on dfds and the rest of the staff who are always happy and helpful
easy and efficient process through check in excellent range of fooddrink availablebreakfast at reasonable price with clean dining area comfortable and pleasant journey great value for money
i would like to thank the staff at pearl seaways what should have been a wonderful trip to winterland went down the drain because my grandson fell ill with vomiting on the floor of the cabin and in the hallway as a result but the staff were lightning fast with carpet cleaners for the floor and biscuits and water for joshepine josephine is on her feet again it wasnt seasickness or the food on board
nice experience friendly staff clean towels during mini cruise
everything well arranged polite staff good food
nice but we arrived hour later by boat so you do the math you still have to take the bus to the city which is hours of your day that you spend there but it is a nice experience good staff unfortunately some really dirty rooms some dont i give it a but they have to work on that
a friendly reception and crew a rather small cabin but lots of spaces and places to be on board delicious dinner with so much to choose from
the great service on board and friendliness of the staff was overwhelming we had a wonderful mini cruise
amazing food and facilities throughout the ship
excellent service premium lounge is always good shame its not a little larger now more people are using it i would love to be able to have a hot meal of some sort in there even if it costs more i dont want to have to go into the main restaurants to eat the sandwiches are a huge improvement and delicious
nice trip but the food is way too expensive a quick trip for me is a cheap way to have a little mini holiday but the food is way too expensive when i go on a trip it is not to go out and eat expensively i expect that there is also a cheap alternative to the new restaurants food dkk for breakfast for a single adult and two children to eat a bit of rolls and eggs and bacon it is simply too expensive and the same with the evening buffet which cost me very dearly the trip itself and the service are fine however for some reason we only had hours in oslo and were given no reason so we didnt miss very much it was very unfortunate basically a nice trip but as a single parent the food is too expensive one wish would be an alternative to the restaurants with a small snack shop with cheap fast food or sandwiches but i am well aware that part of dfds earnings is in the food and that prices have risen worldwide so that is probably not possible
great service fantastic food clean and spacious we did travel with a dog and he was very happy as well
friendly service reminded staff and good food we could do without the partyhappy pax but otherwise top
i dont think ive left a trip advisor review before but i always search for them before booking so felt i had to leave one for this holiday we are a very specific type of traveler i am ceoliac so have to eat gluten free and our son has complex needs and eats a gastrostomy fed real food blended diet this is our third ship cruise holiday this year we went with po from dover to calais in easter and msc in the october holidays it wasnt easy for me to eat with po and we took food for our son msc was awful barely any gluten free food available and what they had was repetitive and poor quality the buffet is marked as not suitable at all they had told us they could do blended and failed every time thankfully we had taken a portable blendjet blender to do it ourselves anyway back to dfds the whole buffet is allergen marked colour and picture coordinated to make it so simple i could eat lots no having to ask lots of questions and feeling like a pest and a complainer the food was lovely and i had no adverse reactions which i would have had with any cross contamination they have lovely gf rolls if you ask three pudding option plus lots of fruit the buffet breakfast was equally good but the absolute best bit was blended it was perfectly blended every time anyone who feeds blended will know this is a tricky balance to get right but they got it spot on they remembered it was to be blended with soy milk each time and between the kitchen staff and the waiting staff they could not have been nicer or more accommodating to make sure we all ate as easily as possible an absolute service for complex needs a side note to say that the soft play lady was also excellent at caring for playing with and including our son all in all other cruise companies really need to look at what dfds are doing and replicate it
the facilities on board lived up to expectations the staff were friendly and welcoming the food and atmosphere were good
all in all an ok trip but visited the steakhouse restaurant which was not a good experience first we waited almost hour for our food and when we got it it was not hot the waiter then failed to put the water on the billarhhhthats an ommer the entertainment in the evening was more of a laugh than a musical experience bad sound bad music and seemed like a bunch of amateurs who hadnt performed before
good food miss family shows though
on the princess seaways our trip was remarkably great the staff were all absolutely lovely and helped us gladly we requested assistance as im disabled and so we were allowed to disembark early with help star service and luxury feeling onboard buffet was also worth the money when prebooked the king seaways was less impressive staff werent as forthcoming and there was an issue with our booking so we were accused of not paying for two evening meals and almost not allowed in for food the cabin was comparatively drab with clinical lighting no soap and the aircon was playing up nevertheless we still had a good experience overall
friendly caring staff clean comfortable cabin smooth checkin procedures
a nice cruise good food and good service we received good help from the checkin staff when it turned out that we had been given the wrong type of cabin in relation to the order the competent employee fixed it quickly and even made an upgrade because the type of cabin we had ordered was sold out good style and service thank you very much
good food great waiters both in the bar and the restaurant great christmas decorations and good fun for the little ones
atmosphere on board food staff
the crew deserves kudos for customer friendliness an unwanted situation partly related to personal health problems was immediately addressed and resolved for me staying on the regina seaways ship is pleasant and be sure to enjoy the more luxurious restaurant and the excellent menu for reasonable prices
pleasant service clean and tidy good information little to do apart from eating and drinking the games section was small and most things were in disrepair very worn bathroom in the room
pleasant boat pearl nice restaurants oh nice service the only thing to complain about is the tv in the cabin only channels that worked hopeless remote control
much is very good especially the breakfast the food at seven seas was also excellent apart from the pork chops it is quite a challenge for a dane to create it wasnt watered down enough and it hadnt been cooked long enough either otherwise there was a lot of noise in the cabin due to the engine and propeller the cabin was on deck furthest aft the service was friendly and helpful
overall we had a really good experience but because those who were in our room while we were ashore in oslo had either turned up the heat on purpose or by accident and we didnt notice it thats why it was unbearably hot inside us it was in long time impossible to sleep on the way hi
fine food was good too
we had a wonderful time on board the food was tasty and plenty of choice and the staff very friendly and helpful the rooms are clean and at first you think the shower is small but it isnt that bad when you stand under it it fluctuates quite a bit now and then which is quite funny when you walk around all in all it was a successful trip
always nice to travel with you just sad to often experience that the childrens pirate menu is replaced with a childrens buffet i know this is easier when there are many children but far from the same experience as having a pirate menu served the feeling of being quotbigquot to be able to choose from a menu card
fast checkin and exit priority boarding is great resulting in quick access to the lounge however there was no food available here which was disappointing
really noisy engine so didnt get any sleep the disembarkation was so slow and unorganised maybe do cabin order next time staff were amazing waiters were fab reception raby i give stars to he was so helpful with our booking needs promoting
we were very satisfied with the commodore deluxe and the associated service one star deducted because the breakfast was very poor for vegans
nice and friendly staff clean room good food
on the ship the staff was pleasantly friendly and helpful cabins are clean food was good not enough space on deck entertainment lost a lot of time on the day of shopping due to customs a great pity
food was good practice practice there is no casino anymore
fun trip we enjoyed our mini cruise to amsterdam explorer kitchen had tasty food and good range of dishes
easy check in including for my pets pleasant helpful staff and comfortable passenger areas
roof leaking in restaurant whilst eating choose a sea view cabin with rusty window cold or warm air didnt work with a fan going constantly non stop couldnt sleep room dirty seriously needs a overhaul
cabin on car deck no lift cabin very small
the sailing left and arrived on time which is very important when part of an extended journey the temperature on the boat was comfortable we travel this route often and noticed yesterday that some elements are beginning to show signs of age and are in need of refresh replacement eg the seating pads in the leather chairs in the relaxing area the upholstery in the tub chairs in and around the back of the ship as usual the staff were all very pleasant booking was straightforward
it was pleasant good food but on the way there was a lot of noise at night on the way back with many more people mainly english we slept wonderfully heard nothing
transport is ok restaurants in board are disapointing the blue riband is closed the other restaurant is awful awful foodbad service pizza restaurant only choices on the menu
nice trip clean and nice fantastic staff on board absolutely everyone was cheerful and with excellent service good musicians and band super breakfast and delicious dinner at explorer but expensive dinner way too expensive animal tax free there was no point in buying anything really little to spare candy is cheaper in norway but a shame with reduced time in copenhagen queue for the shuttle bus to the city centre time in denmark was about hours is too little all in all very happy with the boat next time i will treat myself to a cabin with a balcony on deck
totally unrivaled and very delicious christmas lunch buffet with dishes from the other nordic countries there was so much research dishes so it was impossible to make room for them all in the stomach really had to be selective and taste what we hadnt tried before a good sirloin steak in the steakhouse was also very delicious fantastic service minded and humane staff helpfulness above all good cabin although with a little noise from the pdeck below
hello i got really sick with vomiting shortly after eating your breakfast buffet on thursday and even the next day it was so bad that you had to drive me out in a wheelchair to a taxi after arriving in copenhagen still very bad hope you follow up on it and take it seriously can read that others have had similar experiences etc f
good service everything neatly arranged the cabin was clean friendly staff and the food was also fine plenty to do during the crossing
especially the friendly staff everywhere restaurants duty free shop reception and then i got really nice food both morning and evening have also filled in the form in cabine
everything was very well organised everything neatly indicated and stated only our shower was not very clean the grout was very brown and the shower head was yellow which is why we did not shower on board furthermore very fun activities on board and something for everyone in terms of food im already planning my next trip
i was this time pleasantly surprised to find my cabin clean and well maintained after my bad experience last year as always the crew were very nice and accomodating
super friendly staff courteous in the restaurant the entire trip was very well organized and ran without any loss of time
getting on board in amsterdam and back off again in newcastle was a quick and well coordinated process as so many times before the food service in explorers kitchen were excellent last but not least we enjoyed listening and dancing to the performance by the whats up band in the columbus bar
super friendly staff experience felt relaxed and exactly how it should be we paid for the relax lounge which was nice but a group of people doing work on the boat taking measurements for tablescarpets etc noisily came in and out of the room a few times and woke us up each time not ideal when wed been driving all night and had a hour drive ahead of us hence booking the relax lounge apart from that it was an enjoyable experience
the fried breakfast was not nice bacon dried out like leather and very spicy sausages same as last time so not a one off would not buy again on the way back ship had been in for an hour so no reason to leave late especially as few passengers to load five minutes after we should have sailed the captain told us we were leaving on time we left the harbour entrance exactly minutes after our departure time
good food good standard of cabin and bed pleasant staff must also mention that as a norwegian it will be more expensive than before all in all very satisfied
we liked the friendliness of the staff and the atmosphere on board since it was winter we didnt have the opportunity to sit in peace
compliments to the entire crew of the king seaways on board the experience was absolutely flawless and at times even inspiring everyone was extremely personable and hospitable the crew immediately took on any challenges always with a smile it is cheerful when the staff of the explorer restaurant works with each other with cheerful high fives you can really see that there is a good climate within the team from the waiters to the security guard who went on his security tour at two oclock at night one star deduction for the mattress in our cabin which was very thin and the furnishings of the cabins deserve a general updateupgrade they are now quite dated
the quality of the christmas buffet could have been better
professional service all staff were polite and helpful our cabin was clean and comfortable the food was fresh and tasted lovely variety was amazing the assistance was excellent
we went from ijmuiden to newcastle for a long weekend two person cabins on the th and th deck quite aft the outward journey was ok apart from the weather but dfds cannot do anything about that of course the return journey was terrible in my opinion due to a cabin that vibrated on all sides and therefore also the ceiling and everything else resonated the bed was shaking and then the noise from the interior i really couldnt sleep while the weather was nice on the return trip i was about to ask for another cabin but the rest of the family had already fallen asleep could be bad luck and a specific cabin i dont know breakfast was very extensive and good unfortunately due to the waves on the way there we were unable to eat the prebooked breakfast so all four were seasick in bed the staff is also very friendly
crew are friendly and helpful ship is well kept and cared for down to the crew cabins and bathrooms are exceptionally clean only stars given as food was disappointing second time i have travelled on king seaways from ncl to ams and eaten in the international buffet on both occasions food choices seemed limited this time and hot options were simply not hot maybe a cost cutting measure in place but no excuse for tepid food given this ship is nearly years old its in pretty good shape and well cared for by the crew
transport stage from copenhagen to oslo we ordered the christmas buffet it looked delicious and we had an always pleasant and attentive waiter unfortunately much of the food lacked flavor the pork chops were dry and overly salty and the ribs were mostly greasy and chewy delicious dessert table then
the cabin was good the breakfast was great but the christmas buffet was incredibly disappointing stars if im being kind very limiting what was good maybe that was edible a lot of the food didnt actually go down so that applied to many around us as well and overheard many others also say that the food was not good and many plates were eaten lightly stupid not to at least have an included drink offer when you order a buffet a bit awkward to have to fork out at least nok for a glass of water for choose little italy instead the food there is good
very friendly staff good service the elevators are busy when boarding and disembarking but the staff is very helpful everything was very clean and orderly
even though we were too late to check in we were still helped well and professionally by the security team outside on the premises the same could not be said of the ladies behind the checkin desk who behaved very bitchily and unprofessionally despite the storm on the way there we had a nice boat trip the staff on board were friendly and helpful the buffet on board was absolutely delicious
didnt like the christmas buffet the food was not particularly delicious and they were really bad at filling up the buffet empty dishes that you had to wait a long time for were filled up waited for ris a la mande for minutes
staff were friendly and helpful the food is good and the ship as a whole was very clean
the food was good the service on site was very good ok the live show very good but it was difficult to find anything on site while on other cruises there were signs and signposts the fencing was gaotic and very poorly organised people became aggressive because of the long wait as a year old i almost fainted due to the long wait etc
poorly service the cabin was old and several thing did not work the bathroom door isolation om the front door was losse the bedlights was not in shape
good experience good food but you must bring in servings of carlsberg andor tuborg on the boat norwegians who travel by danish boat expect good danish beer not heineken otherwise the trip was very good
good experiencegood servicegood cabinsuper breakfast buffet can only be recommended
good guidance neat and correct staff perfect buffets perfect trip in everything
easy boarding and sailed on time crew were very friendly and the ship was clean with plenty of comfortable seating would recommend
great staff wonderful buffet and cosy comfortable cabin best way to come home to newcastle
amsterdamnewcastle toilet blocked poor selection in shop breakfast selection average at best newcastleamsterdam perfect
pleasant and helpful staff good catering and comfortable accommodation
where do you start we are a group that is going to travel pcs booking the trip is extremely difficult all must eat the same thing if we are to order in the restaurant we tried to change it a bit to make it easier then they had to delete the entire booking and start over then they also couldnt guarantee that we had time to book the cabins again before some were taken and we ran the risk of not getting everyone it feels like weve booked a trip with the lowbudget company of all time that doesnt really have control over anything the trip itself hasnt been yet but it has started really badly before it has even started only travel with colorline from now on at least they can do customer service there
great food good service and good comfort
really good service and always extremly friendly amazing dinner at the northsea bistro dinner buffet is also rich and does not leave any wishes open but i would recomend going for a course at the bistro rooms are also nice and there is enough on board programm
the rooms were absolutely terrible didnt get updated at all so drop the whole trip
food and the staff were excellent we just had a little cabin room was very small but it was ok for what it cost
friendly and helpful staff clean cabin some vegetarian options at dinner buffet nice selection of breakfast cereals
we got a double bed outside cabin of about square meters including the bathroom the interior more affordable cabin is actually considerably larger this was hopelessly small have had commodore before christmas buffets have dropped significantly in quality over the last years variable service level of waiters the price level in the dining room and bar is now on par with copenhagen pearl and crown have probably now become relatively tired tax free has pleasant service and competitive prices compared to colorline and airports nice bartenders this will probably be the last christmas cruise for us
lack of quiet comfortable seating it was either the noisey barclub or the coffee place so that was a bit disappointing we paid for the all you can eat buffet on the crossing to amsterdam sadly both myself and my mum felt very ill due to the motion of the ship and werent able to have our meal i thought i would have been nice for the offer to be there to switch it to our return journey instead but this didnt seem to be an offer that was forthcoming
this was a trip that exceeded all expectations nice crew clean cabin good food this is certainly the best i have had of the trips previously
the trip last night was very noisy probably due to weather conditions it would have been nice to have had the information that we were going to be late earlier in the trip offloading seemed to take longer than normal staff as always were friendly and helpful food is ok cooked meals are not as good as i would like and its often quite cold and draughty in the cafe
everything is very easy and stessfree the food is great and the service always fiendly and helpfull
the pizza restaurant on the boat was very bad and there was nothing to brag about the chicken they use was different and the food itself had no taste to cost so much was served tasteless pasta with some soupy sauce looked very unappetizing and unsavory otherwise good service and a good experience apart from this
clean tidy good food
great food in the nord sea bistro left on time and plenty to do on board we were running late from newcastle but fortunately a call in advance made them keep the door open a little longer very nice
we had a very nice trip and were very well looked after pleasant and nice people on board food was also plenty of choice and delicious
the room we got was not clean otherwise it was just ok
way to hot in the cabin aircondition did not work properly
it should have been stars if it wasnt for the price also the ship was quite cold
the food was terrible by ghe time i got through check my breakfast was cold
pretty much what one could expect booking boarding and the app works flawlessly the christmas buffet was a letdown but the breakfast buffet was well worth it general an older ship in comparisons with its main competitors entertainment and onboard activities was descent will go again fin need be but dont expect a cruise
there was no heat in the cabin it was only fixed when the reception was contacted the one female bartender at the bar was very loud
helpful if you ask something excellent cuisine with lots of variety in food and an extensive breakfast cabin was clean and tidy
the friendly crew that welcomed you as you boarded was a fantastic start to the trip the room was clean tidy the entertainment was good would have loved a wee sandwich shop as we didnt want the full buffet there were no bar snacks available overall a brilliant short break away
boarding on time no hassle staff on board very helpful friendly comfortable seating
the trip was good because we had the owners suite with access to the commodore lounge large cabin in the front breakfast delivered to the door but the cabins are starting to look worn and a bit oldfashioned the mattress in the bed was very hard and when we showered the whole bathroom floor got wet i dont think the prices on board are particularly cheap since everything is in dkk
booking was easy ship was clean and tidy and staff were very helpful
the staff was great diner was magnificent the only thing that keeps me from giving stars is the air conditioning in the cabin the air is to dry and hot and it cannot be adjusted hopefully you will solve this when you do the refit next year
there were of us on the oslo cruise from was in general inside cabin had preordered wine tasting breakfast sightseeing in oslo and christmas buffet on cabin perfectly fine and we got clean towels at the reception wine tasting also good and can be recommended breakfast ok not more in terms of quality we ate in the restaurant the first evening unfortunately our food was not served at the same time but we were well compensated for this sightseeing was really good the christmas buffet had a really good and tasty fish selection otherwise not suitable for the price so far too expensive for a christmas buffet in relation to quality and price drinks ok in price but that you each have to pay dkk for water when you also order wine for dkk a bottle its too expensive mine a glass of water should follow the order of wine bingo in the bar was so good really good entertainment
efficient comfortable on time shame there was no plant based milk available at the cafbar
clean and comfortable boat very friendly and courteous staff in the checkin and on the boat except the ones serving the food who were a bit offhand to put it mildly nice relaxing lounge excellent tea and very friendly there too comfortable and on time journey
friendly and helpful staff clean cabins and an enjoyable experience thank you
generally smiling and friendly staff but one waiter in particular was just so friendly and chatty clean and nice good activities for the children who really enjoyed the pool and childrens drinks
have sailed with crown for many years now and everything is just as it should be fantastic food wonderful drinks and not least a star crew
the staff were great and the dog facilities are excellent the only thing that could be improved would be the vending machine i had only coin notes and contactless cards but water was through the night there was nowhere to get change the tap water didnt seem too appealing as the dog was refusing to drink it after sniffing it
the staff are very helpful the boat is clean and decorated well a very pleasant experience
must better seating after your upgrade very friendly helpful staff food looked great although i didnt actually eat this time and coffee excellent
comfortable clean and smiling service excellent breakfast good value trip
told to arrive minimum minutes before departure then minutes to offload at other end is far too long very basic facilities at dieppe no caf food on board was awful fish completely overcooked and dried out its cheap convenient for some but overall a poor experience
all the staff were very helpfulall persons in our car have motobility issueswe were placed next to the lifts which meant far less walkingthe staff in the restaurant helped us with food traysthe food is good as wellthankyou for helping us to make this trip
to be completely honest the best food i got on the boat was an open buffet both pizza and steak were bad and overpriced everything was in danish kroner i understand that since its a danish boat but here there is a lot that needs improvement both price on food taxfree and service when it is cheaper to shop in norway than on a boat when it comes to food and drink this is too bad it calls over the price so start with your prices and you will see that this becomes more popular both food and drink and taxfree spending so much on a weekend trip with food would have cost us less here at home think about this for a while rather trying to improve is not stupid
space for everyone great service and cozy surroundings
boarding sailing announcement all was perfect only three stars as i think the food is far too pricey for some spaghetti and a slice of apple pie is that a fair price
the cabins were not ready had to wait a long time the food at the italian restaurant the pizza was very strong chilli sauce think they have used paid but not eaten i wish it was possible to use the buffet as soon as you get on board but this is not the case punctuality is good
on friday my girlfriend and i went on a trip with the oslo boat from home we had ordered courses on board my boyfriend ordered a steak which was supposed to be medium the steak was fiery red and we had to send it back twice unfortunately we also had to send the homemade barnaise sauce back twice as it was separated both times i ordered a chicken which was super dry and not juicy or presentable at all all in all we paid over kroner for this not so delicious meal in their ala carte restaurant on no one can we recommend others and choose it when they travel with the oslo boat super sad
the thing i liked was how helpful all the staff was also the loading and unloading were quickthe food was good really enjoyable trip
cote dopale was a smart bright ship less so the cotes des flandres which is in need of a refurb chips and fish finders were too soggy could have been crisper otherwise a good experience
great polite staff food was good clean room good bed room was a bit too warm air conditioning was not optimal
staff were very friendly cabin was clean buffet on board was great first time taking car and whole experience was simple and easy to do
the boat was pretty clean and didnt feel crowded at all we paid extra for the buffet and the food was actually quite decent so would recommend this much better experience overall than expected the only negative is the rooms are tiny but other than that it was good
the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly when we rebooked our trip so that we could return a day earlier this was arranged within minutes what a service only positive experiences on the ship friendly staff good food opportunities for relaxation an ideal way to travel to scotland in your own car
good food clean polite staff and good music
incredibly bad service and it was not a pleasant trip for us the food was not edible except for the breakfast very disappointing and not accommodating when we tried to complain steer away
everything went very well boat on time and premium lounge very quiet thank you
good service and friendliness everywhere despite general it problems in relation to the tickets
fantastic staff everywhere incredibly welcoming most delicious evening and morning buffet both days
cozy room with sea view pleasant surprise with bubbles in the room good service pleasant staff with some speed in the guitar music it was fun on the dance floor would like info on loudspeakers to be clearerslower for norwegian pensioners
the whole experience was fantastic apart from the female greeter at the evening meal who was very very rude and even told us breakfast was to be served from am and when we turned up at am it wasnt open
most of it was great what could be improved is that the pizza restaurant uses real chicken on the pizza and does not use some kind of mixed product and that the bar also has organic tea and not only teas with artificial additives in general i miss the focus and offer of organic food and drink on board
brilliant service excellent crew north sea bistro is an excellent what feels like personal dining experience the whole journey was just as it says on the tin
friendly staff timely boarding fair price and tasty meal
good food good service good drinks
staysmancruise october we were greeted by a dirty bathroom staff with bad attitudes cold and bad food in the buffet as well as a bus from kiel that only had one departure which meant that we had to take a taxi when the bus was full i would not recommend this route further unfortunately
noisy next door neighbours could hear every word fart and snore but i still give the crew stars went above and beyond
delicious food helpful and welcoming staff cozy surroundings and a good selection in the taxfree shop the only criticism i have is that your soda is from royal unibrew and not coca cola i cant stand sweeteners which are in almost all royal unibrew soft drinks so the only soft drink on board i can drink is faxe kondi and it gets a bit boring in the long run it would be great if you also had coca cola all in all a mini cruise is definitely something that can be recommended
we were on the copenhell mini cruise and it was a good experience it was clean the staff seemed happy the food was good and then there were sailors who sang goodbye when we disembarked what more could you want
crew helped a lot with our stuff my sister is pregnant and the man with the long hair in a ponytail helped her a lot with her things
great operator welcome you when you come on board decent food at a fair price enough space for everyone
sweet and helpful staff to welcome the passengers super service and good food
i arrived an hour after checkin started the cabin was not made up the whole corridor was filled with laundry and in the background i saw a friendly cleaner who made some phone calls i waited for a bit could not get any information and left the luggage outside the cabin and found the reception the receptionist looked at me with a tired face and gave me another cabin without ever uttering words like sorry or here is a voucher for a free coffee or hope you will enjoy the journey maybe because i was travelling on a ticket with a discount i went back to the cabin no change there got my luggage and carried it all the way back and over to the other side that cabin was ready i paid for a hour use of internet it did not work so i went back to the reception and had it arranged there in the morning i was thrown off again i had booked a table at eight in the buffet restaurant since i was travelling alone i got a table in the middle of the space on a single table centimeters from a loud party or i could choose a sofa facing a wall where all the childrens chairs were stabled and where the staff was leaving the dirty dishesand prepared breakfast facilities i chose that option an hour later the staff started packing away the food cleaned and hosed and wheeled everything away the man serving me was nice and he smiled when i hurried out taking the hint i did not have breakfast the next morning i am a regular and a usually happy passenger but it will be some time before i take the ferry next time
super cool with the collaboration between bquotastard cafe and the many cool games the food is not very good and could have been much better ended up with a bad stomach drinks were really good and can be highly recommended
good price for the cabin
there is a cozy and relaxed atmosphere at pearl the staff is very accommodating you are doing well however some delicious salads are missing from the buffet in seas
great experience cinema games room and bingo good for big kids and adults softplay for little kids clean ship friendly staff couple of downsides walls are paper thin take ear plugs if you dont want to listen to romantic liaisons an eye mask ask for an extra pillow from reception cabins were red hot too warm for the fleece pjs we brought plugs arent uk so take an adapter you are allowed own food and drink which is good as its expensive on ship starbucks was handy for coffee after not much sleep and take kwells if you get a bit seasick although the shop does sell them duty free is canny too all in all a good experience
a really good trip on a beautiful ship with really good food and very nice staff can only give dfds the best recommendations we would love to return on another trip please flemming post
everything was brilliant the staff were friendly and helpful the food at dinner and breakfast was excellent car parking staff were clear and professional extremely happy only gave as we had a deck cabin in the way there which was fab but deck on the way back which was less good
in particular the buffet was not hot it was lukewarm and the reception from the buffet gave us a rather unfriendly reception the soup tasted like candle wax the childrens buffet was completely cold from pasta to sauces we got a room right below the swimming area so the nights were bad and very noisy the childrens entertainment was really great and the actors did a fantastic job all in all i was quite disappointed because of the room the staff and the food even because the boat was not fully booked i dont understand why they assigned us and many others such bad rooms
the food was atrocious the vegetable soup especially will linger in my mind for ever never have i experienced anything so tasteless insipid the staffcrew all appeared to be totally disinterested in their tasks just wanting to get the crossing over with the passengers gone not at all the experience one associates with france as usual the unloading of vehicles was painfully slow particularly at newhaven overall the whole experience these days is mediocre compared with the past
comfortable lounge smooth checkin food reasonable quality and choice
i would normally rate my experience with you at stars but i had to take one off for the following reason we always travel with our dogs and are usually put on deck this time we were put on deck which has much lower ceiling and it therefore less airy than deck it was in october so not a hot daybut when we got back toour car the temperature inside it was and one of our dogs was panting heavily i had all windows open and the sliding roof ajar we have never experienced this before even in summer as we have never been on deck before is there a policy about which deck pets go on otherwise why do we have the yellow leaflet on the overhead mirror if our journey had been in summer my dog might have been seriously ill sarah mann
x bad experiences same day at restaurant seas on the breakfast buffet we started with a busy breakfast buffet which is to be expected when there are so many people in the same place when there is an empty table we want to help the staff to clear it so that we can move on quickly and ask a waiter where we can put dirty dishes from previous guests here we are greeted by a most rude tone the waiter directly tells us if we cant just find another table and when i say that we have sat at the table with our children and really want to help the waiter rolls his eyes and walks into the kitchen leaving me with the dirty service in my hands which i myself must find a place to put evening buffet we participate in the evening buffet which is actually quite delicious i find a long black hair in one of the hot dishes and politely approach the staff as i am aware that this sort of thing can occur in a buffet my outrage only starts when the kitchen staff first tries to fish out the hair with their fingers out in the buffet to leave the dish for other guests i think he notices my wide eyes when after a short time he changes his mind and takes the dish into the kitchen however after a short time i can ascertain that even the same dish has returned but without hair this time it must be discarded it is deeply unprofessionally handled by the production staff in such a busy restaurant one should be able to tolerate discarding a gastro tray with vegetables according to quite normal food regulations we ate the day before at the explorer the steak restaurant here there was neither a finger to put a finger on the food nor the service
we two families with small children ate on the ferry at pm shortly afterwards a large party of drunken men arrived and were placed beside us they made an incredible amount of noise and the staff did nothing to silence them i therefore tried to ask them to calm down but it didnt help our worst restaurant experience to date by no means a childfriendly place
very friendly and helpful staff everywhere on the ship
good facilities good food top staff very positive experience
the trip itself went well quite pleasantly the prices of food and drink are too high especially in relation to the quality and experience in restaurants etc the selection of entertainment activities is too boring information was generally lacking
as usual we had a great time except we traveled with an year old and paid for dinner i was and she was disappointed no chicken nuggets she had chips both journeys an expensive dinner maybe a better selection for kids meals please
i think it was a fantastic minicrouis i was with my children and we had a great time we ate delicious food in the restaurant and all in all i would definitely recommend it the indoor and outdoor swimming pool worked really well and my children enjoyed it
a wonderful experience good food lovely surroundings we noticed there was quite a bit of dust in the corners of the cabin and some of the staff seemed very snarky and almost rude but the other staff were very nice and welcoming especially the staff at bubblezone
staff were very good room was comfortable and clean breakfast was excellent disembarking was a hassle but this was outwith your control
we booked at and they didnt want to let us go at while we were on time the lady was very rude
dear dfds years since the last trip with you so we just had to find our way through it all it went well helpful friendly and attentive staff everywhere good selection in duty free clean and nice cabin really good dining experience in rest explorer but the evening environment in seven seas it was a total misjudgment that we had booked a table there the first night there was so much noise children running and parents shouting or resigned parents and then there were the staff who took it all in stride kudos to them unfortunately they could not help us to a quieter location next door we then found that there was a childrens club at the nightclub and a bouncy castle at the disco there were actually children everywhere everywhere and yes it is the autumn holidays but could you consider establishing a zone a place for adults only best regards from a couple in the middle of life who love children but who dont necessarily think its cool to have children crawling over our backs when were sitting and eating
sweet smiling waiters ready for spas and funny remarks helpful and accommodating in both seas and navigator in the columbus club there was a younger woman waitresswaiter who was unusually flabby and unkempt otherwise it takes a lot before i get offended but she was in no way customer friendly
from start to finish the service and friendly attitude of the staff made the trip great the food was great and the prices were good
all of the staff were very polite and helpful the accommodation was surprisingly comfortable and very clean my journey from newcastle to amsterdam was an overall out of experience
good service on board good selection of food good entertainmentactivities and inventions good cabinsgood selection plenty of time ashore before returning had a bit of a minus with the weather but its certainly not easy to manage
the service was pleasant and helpful clean and nice pleasant and good selection according to need i think and the weather was taken into account
the cabin was nice but i think the pillows were very thin commodore class nice breakfast without crowding and queuing but i think some of the food on the dinner buffet had the effect of being left too long at the pm table setting but a good overall experience and will be happy to return
the food was fantastic not just the seas buffet but even the pizzas at the italian one however it was a little disappointing that the notsocheap special beer tasting only offered the svaneke beer we buy down in brugsen not rare goods from bohemia and belgium the friendly captain on a stormy ride set off down a bit so most could have fallen asleep before we passed skagen and stood out in the metre waves in skagerak you cant do more when youre not in control of the weather the service was also always friendly
i have just sailed to oslo and back for the first time seeing how many reviews here were negative due to specific cases i thought it would be fair to add a generally positive one i was very pleasantly surprised there was good food comfortable bars to sit in and the bed in the cabin was not too small im cm the staff was also very friendly i took crown out and pearl home apart from pearl being smaller the restaurant and bars are almost exactly identical on the two ships
very well organized and carried out i understand that dogs are not allowed in the public areas its a shame but you cant order food to your room you dont want to eat out alone in stages or leave your dog alone and its a shame that the pet rooms are in a relatively bad state they would be in good shape to be renovated but that doesnt stop us from traveling
checkin was uncomplicated we had imagined breakfast to be much better just a mass processing a cocoa for the children for breakfast would not have been bad either on the first evening from amsterdam to newcastle we were pleasantly surprised by the evening buffet but that was to change on the second evening the buffet was exactly the same as the previous day on the first evening we ate at pm everything was beautifully prepared on the second evening we didnt eat until pm everything was simply laid out carelessly the bed cabins with sea view urgently need renovation cinema only in english so not suitable for german children otherwise it was a lovely crossing
you couldnt get any sleep too many drunk people loud music there was no room for family time i think they could say they have a huge party before you pay money for a quiet trip with your family
the crossing and the food were good id love to come back
the staff were as always sweet nice and helpful the seas buffet on the other hand was really mean and disappointing we sailed with crown the selection was boring and bland and there was a lack of a proper salad bar but as always had a nice trip
good time in denmark is gold nice staff bad mattress in the bed was disappointed by the buffet
there could be better beds please change
expensive and not good what you can buy on board cheaper in norway especially if you want to buy something in the socalled dutyfree the unethical heineken beer is also declining a lot of noise everywhere music but not very good music i call it noise they should stop horse racing some nonsense but something was also good just getting to sea clean cabins but almost nonfunctioning tv
no overcrowding very nice and friendly staff timekeeping was good so a very pleasant sailing
honestly worst experience the cinema was shocking had to return tickets the food was awful and way over priced it was cold and had no flavour the selection was so bad to choose from as well got disgusting looks off the waitress because i complain my pepsi was flat it tasted like water tried to book the al a cart menu on the way home but even that menu was poor the atm machines were broken so we couldnt get change to play the arcade machines and even if we did have change we wouldnt be very entertained the coffee was shocking and we were told they only had milk which im lactose intolerant so thats not much help the music was not good as at and the live performers where trying there best which wasnt very good will say the bingo guy was very entertaining and made me laugh overall no wonder the deal was so cheap because everything on board was awful and overpriced the only thing i will say is the staff on board were fairly nice werent very chatty but they werent rude so ill give them that lastly the rooms are just decent you think it will do because youre sold the idea youll only be in them to sleep but we were so bored that we sat and watched netflix the full hrs which btw we had the just to get wifi
comfortable cabin only mattress was not pleasant very warm food was fine
apart from a hiccup with booking everything went smoothly
over all it was nice but beds are a bit uncomfortable
everything works good service good experiences for children of all ages we always look forward to eating at seven seas
no issues at all so much more relaxed than flying and all that goes with it breakfast great cabin totally adequate and perfectly clean thank you
always pleasant but we regret that the wine bar was replaced by a cocktail bar
mini cruise copenhagen oslo from friday to sunday be what a magnificent experience we had chosen the commodore class incl course menu in restaurant blue riband and luxury breakfast we also had free bar the bronze package absolutely the best courses of food and wines we have ever had super service from waiter our cabin was perfect clean and nice we have already booked a new trip
some bad beds we lay on deck and my bed there was a deep hole in the middle so i lay in a hole all night my barbarian had a bed that was not straight so she almost fell out of bed during the break of the childrens entertainment there were many children who drifted and ran and jumped especially the small corridor that runs between the tables down from the tendon between the tables almost up to where we were sitting the mother stood there herself but laughed at her child just hold on and stood right up in the table we took know i have nothing against children but their parents must ask their children to be considerate of others and not just use the venue as a big playground so the parents can just sit and drink and let the children run all over tried to ask them to stop in a nice way but then she would just argue with me and im sorry its not nice this is a family boat for everyone and not a nursery school
minutes late to copenhagen so hours became just over liked that it was now much cleaner on the boatshower than before liked that you could get pints before departure not just bottles as before
what was great was checkin instructions time on the sun deck what was mediocre was the noise level in the seaside seating sleeping was out of the question what was bad was that you can only eat your own food outside or in your cabin if you have one of course nobody follows this rule but its still unfriendly of you a special rule for alcoholic drinks is also completely ridiculous there is also no free wifi the prices in the dutyfree shop are much higher than in normal shops in germany
completely uncomplicated crossing very well organized the ship is clean and well looked after unfortunately the food is cold instead of warm and the taste leaves a lot to be desired
this was a really cheap min cruise with the grandchildren for the price this was great we ate well and had a pleasant miniholiday we knew what we were getting into and didnt ask for more the only thing we could complain about on the trip had to do with the arrival in oslo m not the journey itself upon arrival many people gathered in the hall in front of a narrow door it felt quite unsafe poor logistics in oslo upon arrival
we always love to travel with dfds when we are going to copenhagen we ate in the seas restaurant on the way to c the food tasted ok but we ageeed that it didnt taste as good this time on the way back we ate in little italy the food tasted good but our waitress wasnt all that service minded the cabin was ok the bathroom floor was renovated
on time not too crowded port easy to find pleasant crew coffee and tea poor could be improved unloading very slow
amazing we always try to use dfds from day one we travel at least a couple of times a year spotless clean good food cabins are large and beautifulbeds are so comfortable love the soaps etc majority of the staff are great especially with our little ones we definitely will book again for next year they are always my first choice for years now
on the trip from oslo to copenhagen thursday i got very sick not seasick and was well treatedtaking care of by of the crew they were very serious about the treatment and did also come to my cabin during the night just to check and again in the morning im very satisgied with the empati and service by those three it seems like the crew had some good procedures to follow tak before that happend i had a very tasty pizza at rest little italy
great food and the staff was very friendly
first trip disappointed with the coffee lady she is hottempered and rude to me i thought there were of them making coffee i just asked where is the cappuccino and she shouted quoti only have one handquot instead she shut up she got angrier at me when i said thatquot keg just ask my friends cappuccinoquot she throws things and looks at me like shes going to beat me she takes her bad behavior at work many heard how she treated me its unacceptable she should dont work with customers racist type i have sent a complaint in their customer box
return journey with king seaways this boat has several options for entertainment but the atmosphere was definitely different than on the outward journey compliments to the employees who served dinner and breakfast who were great but in terms of dinner the quality was a bit lower than on the outward journey and the breakfast was also slightly less than on the outward journey beds room and bathroom were spotless nothing to complain about
an absolutely fantastic experience nice cabin on pearl delicious restaurants cozy entertainment and staff who are always in a good mood the only minus is that the commodores at crown were not quite as big and delicious as was promised when ordering and as they are at pearl
x problems with it at customs which meant we had to wait a long time to board the boat everything else was very good nord sea restaurant was very good and the crew very helpful
got across the channel safely and on time reasonable ticket price downside is overpriced rubbish food in onboard restaurants with obscure pricing note some hazardous painful trips on cardeck side walkways
staff were friendly great amenities thoroughly enjoyable experience
cozy restaurants bars with friendly and gentle service
i am quite fed up with staying in cabins where previous guests have recently thrown up
the oslo boat is always a hit a mini cruise offers something for all ages good food good drinks and live music and good entertainment throughout the day adapted to the age group depending on what time of the day there was entertainment oslo is a beautiful city combined with the oslo boat it was perfect for us we can highly recommend the restaurant with buffet the bedding had a small stain from the start but the staff came immediately and changed it there was good service throughout the weekend
been disabled we where treated like family from getting on too returning from our trip into amsterdam nothing was a bother especially when we went for food fernando was a lovely man showing us how to go on and nothing was too much for him a real credit too your company
very kind and friendly on board waiting room at newhaven very dismal a shame that cafe no longer exists foot passengers at dieppe would appreciate transport into dieppe itself its a long walk
i had to knock off star as hot drinks were not good purchased from the bar latte they were undrinkable on return journey purchased a hot chocolate the same shame because on a hour channel crossing a hot drink is important
the interior design of the boat was spacious the restaurant was clean food choices simple but good quality the staff were courteous
good overall first experience friendly staff good food and not over priced at the bars
nice cabin that is sparkling clean incredibly delicious morning buffet and evening buffet restaurant with lovely service large selection in tax free
clean and nice ship the beds in the cabin are really poor and we leave with a sore back
punctual comfortable and clean facilities of the ship throughout friendly staff
the employees are super nice and really nice to be with and super good food
good food airy common areas good duty free shop the standard cabins are in dire need of an upgrade
we pay a lot for travelling with dog so you can organize a more friendly sitting area outside on the deck with normal chairs for us people no problem to sit in a seperate dedicatede area all the dogs we have meet where all well educated so no need to treat us as lepers it would be also to offer small meals ouside of the restaurants like chips or pizza everything else was nice cabin friendly staff and departure and arrival in time
a bit unhappy here when a dance cruise is advertised there should be more music on stage way too early and finish at miss tea dance in the afternoon too a bit of bragging at the end the buffet on board was very good
at breakfast i asked someone to come and wipe the table i was told that someone will come and do it shortly no one came the second time i asked the waiter to bring a cloth to wipe and she replied quotits been cleanedquot what the hell kind of answer is that i had to go up a third time and ask for a cloth so i could do it myself i came back and started drying off and another man came and took the table so we found a new table that i had to clean again you can get rid of that attitude to put it nicely
the food was as always very good and we look forward to it every time a highlight of the crossing the band on board was really good and it was fun to listen to them unfortunately there was only heineken on tap on board we really miss guinness on tap then the trip would be perfect
ship was very clean staff were kind and despite the howling winds the ship performed admirably
really good entertainment by kandis on tuesday evening however the food on board is right at the expensive end there were several of us who asked for french fries and sausages but they were not available on board but really delicious breakfast buffet
sailing on the ship really good food was better than anticipated bad things when queuing up going out to amsterdam we got drenched no cover for motorcycle sailed back into newcastle again raining and got absolutely drenched no cover as you are underneath ship you cant see weather out side cant understand why they dont let so many motorcycles off at a time when it raining or crew could at least tell people that its raining so we can but wet weather gear on just a few ideas what maybe could be put forward
almost perfect but very cold in the bars and very loud music drinks were expensive a bit too warm in the cabins it was nice that we got a larger cabin on the way back very helpful staff
overall a really nice trip with friendly staff and nice and clean cabins however the bathroom was a bit sad to look at the drain in the shower was very bad and the water came out everywhere other than through the shower head the dressing in the pool area needs a loving hand many shower rooms could not be locked and it would be a huge advantage to have a single stool and some hooks in the cabins
the bed was dirty and the glasses in the cabin well used with lipstick marks
the cabin was a nice size but the night lights have a red switch button that shines right in the head at an ang buffet restaurant there was bad service we sat at our table for a long time without being served and the woman who managed the seats seemed very angry and unfriendly the music in the evening was then of poor quality so it was impossible to listen to bobbel zone was not to be in for children who jumped into the water even though it was forbidden all in all a very mixed experience
first cabin was not ok so we was upgrade without problems so we payd xtra and had very nice cabin
troublefree travel by car large selection of food quality ok cabins very noisy
the employees on board they are nice and friendly however the cabin was too small for a double bed
we unfortunately experienced that the smoking restrictions on deck were not respected and we and our children were exposed to passive smoking every time we moved outside the play area for the kids was a big disappointment bears the hallmark of a large focus on the sale of alcohol and we felt there was very little space for the cruise family
our commodore cabin was worn and dirty when we went to bed in the evening there was a mask our bathroom was quite worn and had not been cleaned for a long time the dispenser for products was greasy and full of soap residue and black lint we have taken pictures staff in the information were friendly and would have upgraded us but there was nothing available we had the mask removed but not cleaned as promised we were given a credit for drinks as compensation the fact that there was a used mask by the bed probably says everything about the cleaning standard and it is not a cabin that can be called a commodore anymore due to wear and tear
staff helpful left on time i was able to get an earlier ferry which made life easier at the other end pity the food was served not hot both ways other than that good
on time good facilities on board friendly staff food could be better though always have impression its not fresh which is a shame because a nice meal on board would make it perfect i have eaten out of necessity but have never been impressed sadly
the service is fantastic beds fine and the food too we enjoyed
food was excellent especially variety of buffet staff helpful and great facilities on board for young and old i will definitely be back
nice ship good food helpful staff clean cabin good prices in the duty free plenty to do on board and entertainment
staff safety sailing all star service the only thing that lets it down is quality of food in the restaurant its rather terrible with predominately french staff i think it could be much better machine coffee is undrinkable ship interior is tired very tired in places but for a hr crossing that doesnt matter duty free shop is small it could probably do with more selection but has got really good offers all staff were lovely
the staff were helpful and polite the facilities were modern and clean the boarding process was very efficient it would be stars if the sleeping recliner seats reclined more and were in a darker more closed off room a pleasant crossing
friendly crew it was clean and not so loud live the other two times
very good price we got a lot for the money compared to colorline kieloslo the cabin was small if we were to do the trip again we would pay more for a higher standard buffet dinner and breakfast were good it was not a holiday trip and we did not use the lounge or bar offer
checkin was super easy the people on board were super nice the weather was good the cinema was great the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was very filling and delicious everything was great
for some reason on this occasion the journey time was an hour longer both on the outward and inbound journey we always travel with two dogs and often make this trip four or five times a year on this return trip we returned to see both dogs extremely hot with one of them in a state of distress despite four windows being left open for them the cabins and other areas of the ship have the benefit of air conditioning and it would help if the lower decks were cooled in periods of extreme heat for the safety of animals that have to be left in cars thankfully this was a night crossing otherwise i think we would have lost at least one dog to heatstroke
it is always a great experience travelling with dfds the room was clean looked like it was recently renovated the food as always very good both in a cafe and in the breakfast restaurant but what i liked the most is the area for children the area was filled with different activities from face painting to building blocks and colouring pageshighly recommend
super service and really friendly staff we could have been without the waves but otherwise it was so good however the wait to get off the ship in oslo was very long and poorly coordinated everyone was nice and friendly and the food was really good it was well marked so that you could find any glutenfree in the buffet
efficient comfortable ferry service food was also really good
we were ladies aged and who had a nice and quiet journey reasonable but clean and nice cabins didnt notice any noise at night good food pleasant service etc but shocked by the prices in taxfree lots of chocolate etc more expensive than in stores in norway and you can get clothes of the same brand just as cheap or cheaper in oslo the prices should have been marked with both dkk and nok
everything was clean and nice except that the food is not very good quite expensive both at the restaurant and at the store and very expensive internet
very customer friendly beds small for someone over m bistro restaurant was tasty the buffet was not
i liked the cleanliness order service and very tasty food
nice cabin the reason i dont give stars but is that the mattresses were well used
nice people good food
aging ship we were a family with children and stayed in a standard dogfriendly room in room very loud ventilation system broken very stuffy warm air we had to change rooms at night because there was only enough air for one passenger even after complaining we were only offered an alternative after hours restaurant very crowded and loud you can expect more for
tightly organized neatly arranged exactly what you want assortment of food could be a bit more extensive and of better quality in our opinion but functional now
can not fault the trip staff food and entertainment was really good
beautiful ship clean everything is well organized i like the quotorcaquot observation lounge and the observation deck at the front of king seaways the most there is even a wildlife expert on board
on our minicruise we had to go to reception no less than three times in two days to get soap in the dispenser in the bathroom unfortunately neither the taste selection nor quality matched the stiff prices of the breakfast and dinner buffets
checkin was well organized staff super friendly and very helpful food was very good everything is highly recommended always happy to come back
pleasant staff on board and at the terminals could the self service restaurant display a menu of the days offerings rather than having to ask
great food very friendly staff and a relaxed athmosphere very recommended
rooms very clean went to explorers for buffet dinner and was very impressed with quality of food and range to suit all options highly recommend
check in was quick and easy having a motorcycle the team took great care securing the bike onboard onboard staff friendly full english breakfast was great thankyou
nice experience clean cabins friendly and helpful staff only the ladies toilet near the dining room could be cleaned more often
good alternative the staff were very friendly and helpful we had booked the evening buffet as part of the trip but it wasnt quite to our taste it was ok and you could eat it but nothing special it took a while for someone to come to take our drinks order the breakfast buffet was very good the cabins were very small perhaps they should have been described better on the hp when booking i would definitely have booked a larger one with people you could hardly move cleanliness was very good nothing to complain about despite everything crossing by ferry is a very good thing
super service and good food good relations with people with disabilities
we were very impressed with the selection and quality of the evening and breakfast buffets however we were disappointed with our cabin on deck the upper bunk beds were practically unusable our children could not sleep in them because there was no safety guard on the edge and we could not sleep in them either because they were so high up that you touched the ceiling when you turned over the distance between the lower and upper beds needs to be reduced so that you can sleep up there too
everything perfectly arranged the only downside is that it is not clearly indicated where your paid parking lot is located we had to search for it and dinner on the return trip was exactly the same as the outward trip it was good but the same food as on the outward journey
quick check in good food on board
this was the th time we traveled with dfds from ijmuiden to newcastle as always a great trip a clean hut with comfortable pillow on the bed a helpful crew delicious diner buffet and good breakfast i dont know how they are with animals maybe next year ill take the dog with us
the personel is very helpfull what we are missing is a place for a small snack there are only expensive restaurants and the choice of beers is to small only heineken why not the tasty english beers
i have nothing to fault the people who work on board but the cabins need a real refurbishment the cabin looked downright dirty the walls had stains the bathroom was so tired that they looked dirty etc which gave a very bad impression i had booked a cabin with a sea view and a double bed dont do this the window is covered with a brown layer that makes it difficult to see out the double bed takes up the entire space so that you hardly get into the cabin you get better space if you choose a standard cabin
got put on earlier ferry twice which was helpful free kids meal much appreciated
mini cruise was fabulous staff excellent from the moment of booking to checkin to onboard clean ship lots of choice cabin size ample and good choice great
the catering could be a bit more varied everything else was ok
poor service misleading prices breakfast included but not when you have to pay not even their leaders take action take the hour plane instead
generally very relaxed travel nice experience room has everything a la carte restaurant and breakfast buffet very good friendly service bar on top of the boat is great only on the way back did it take a long time for the bus ride from the center of newcastle to the boat and boarding the latter due to a defective foot bridge in total this took more than two hours which we would have preferred to spend in the sky bar the live music on board was very much aimed at the elderly passengers something for the somewhat younger people would be nice
very clean in shared toilets clean in cabin delicious food in seas friendly service
breakfast was very very good great selection healthy great organization good standby systems despite the captain being ill a replacement was found in no time very nice staff very comfortable ferry
we paid for a meal in the north sea bistro on both nights and can honestly say the meals were outstanding service was excellent and the restaurant ambiance was relaxed but felt opulent the entertainment in the navigation bar was also excellent with two different singers equally enjoyable the staff were friendly and extremely helpful
the breakfast buffet was poor and the coffee tasted like it was from yesterday a lot of dust in the room
we had a standard cabin with window which was small for peope but totally sufficient for the onenight journey all was clean and as we realised missing soap a staff member quickly filled it up staff we encountered was always very friendly organisation of the many passengers on board restaurant booking announcements leaving the ship was convenient and productive restaurant offered a rich buffet which satisfies many tastes we also very much appreciated the presence of the marine biologist on board who explained and showed us the animals we could observe during the trip
having to pay for a cup of tea when already paid for meals
the smooth process was impressive but above all the friendly staff the attendants on the car deck were informative and helpful the room service was also excellent we were also delighted with the food the only downside the rooms are a bit dated and not quite as fresh all in all a great experience that exceeded our expectations we would gladly go back
booked a knitting cruise for adults in a handicap cabin nice and clean cabin good space nice arrangement good food great cruise what is minus is the person i brought with me could not take the lift alone as the doors closed too quickly before the person got into the lifts trillett at the reception but was just stuffed away didnt get help such behavior is not good tableware by the staff on board this must be improved greetings anne kristin halvorsen bokfinkvegen kongsvinger
very good service however the management of customers occupying restaurant seats and tables when not dining could be more controlled
we had a dog with us and it was very taken into account
great experience seemless boarding helpful staff and the kiddies free meal was a nice surprise
lovely staff giving out balloons to the children comfy seating food good
route kiel klaipeda with athena seaways the departure and arrival were on time the cabin was tidy the staff couldnt speak a word the food was terrible cheapest convenience food lukewarm tasteless and because it was so good we had exactly the same rubbish for lunch as we had for dinner bottomless
the mini cruise to newcastle was a great experience the outside cabin we booked was comfortable despite having a small double bed it was clean and tidy unfortunately there was no tv the buffets were excellent and offered a wide range of different dishes stars for that alone the service on board was also great the crew was very friendly and always helpful the bars and evening entertainment were also ok the prices were reasonable we will do the trip again and can recommend it without reservation
great atmosphere on the ship the staff are all fantastic very friendly and look after you still a bit pricey on the ship especially for food apart from that great couple of days and a very smooth crossing which helped
good food nice personel good handling of the bicycles
the price was reasonable the poor management of the meals was disappointing i had to wait minutes until it was my turn
good reception on the ship smooth checkin person cabin was small but with a fine bed food at north see bistro was fine
we had a fantastic trip to and from oslo it was really a good and beautiful experience we were served the most wonderful food and all the staff were so nice and friendly we had a nice cabin and it was a short way to the pool spa which we also used with great satisfaction however we have contacted customer service as the room was not cleaned on arrival products for the bath were missing and we ordered breakfast from room service which was also missing and it was a messy affair when you otherwise see what breakfast is in the restaurant itself so we would definitely not recommend others to order it we hope that the above will be taken care of unfortunately like other reviewers we have to say its a shame with all the smoking in outdoor venues despite the shortcomings i would still give stars for a fantastic trip experience and luckily the weather was also with us and would definitely like to go on another trip again
firstly you had to learn and write danish commodore de luxe lounge was below all criticism the chairs are too low once you sit down you need good arm strength and grab the table to get up the selection was too small but a group of swedes had then found out that it was a cheap branded ticket confronted staff instead suspected the complainer of whether he had access to the lounge at all on the other hand the service in explorers steakhouse was outstanding in the columbus night club you cant complain about the service because there was none
on the trip to oslo everything was fine returning to copenhagen however the cabin was far from satisfactory the toilet was unpleasantly discolored the sink stopped and the door to the cabin was not equipped with any kind of moldings this meant that there was an incredible amount of noise from the hallway and that the light from the hallway shone in so that the room was not dark at night i could have reported the errors but i think there must be some form of communication with the cleaning staff the facilities on the boat are otherwise quite ok and so are the staff
very good information service real cruise feeling clean spacious cabin great food selection easy checkin
plus onboard service was good shop was well stocked and cabins were clean and comfortable negatives boarding less that minutes before sailing making for a very late dinner and limited sleep time surely getting people on board and spending in the restaurant and bar would be a smarter approach
our experience on the kiel klaipeda ferry was overall positive except for the buffet lunch and dinner the offer for vegetarians was very poor eg no single main dish yet meat choices and fish
it was ok was clean and tidy just need more sofas or a place for who wants to have a proper nap after long drive
the positive and helpfull crew good varity of food nice and clean cabins
smiles and friendliness across the board both kiosk and restaurant
as usual very efficient appart from the que for the food on such a busy crossing the girl on the till needed more help
it was punctual comfortable and food was good
had a super trip on the ferry from amsterdam to newcastle the staff on board are very polite and friendly food in the breakfast buffet was delicious all round great experience
made this cruise for the time perfect service on board friendly and helpful staff very good and extensive restaurant simply recommended
super service super breakfast and super dinner on board both ways copenhagen oslo and return
we went to newcastle with the princess very nice kennels neatly indicated on the kennel where which dog was allowed the smell of urine was very strong better or more frequent cleaning is required more space to be outside is also desirable the cabin where we slept was neat for a night we came to ijmuiden with the king here the dog kennels were old and rusty my white golden retriever had rust spots everywhere there was no table no towels available here too cleaning could be much better fortunately there were blankets in the kennel but we forgot to get them due to the hustle and bustle of parking by the staff and afterwards we were unable to open the door to get anything out of the car due to lack of space this was better arranged at the princess our sleeping place was fine
as mentioned by everyone great customer service very impressed however the catering was appalling first trip i had a salad looked good but needed a dressing return journey my chicken looked like it had been overlooked days before and reheated i exchanged it for boeuf bourgignon but that was almost inedible my husband wasnt impressed with his food either and these were not cheap brittany ferries wins hands down on food im afraid and ill be bringing my own next time on dfds
the staff was very nice and very helpful the ship was very clean and the food in the restaurant was cooked spot on liked every thing will travel with dfds again thank you so much
unfortunately the ventilation and air conditioning in the room were so loud that i could still hear them despite wearing earplugs it was also very cold even though it was set to full heat all i was told was that it was the way it was and that it couldnt be changed i ended up sleeping with my clothes on at night because it was so drafty in general the room looked very battered there were various places in the bathroom that looked as if someone had hit them otherwise the ship seems to have seen better days the staff get annoyed very quickly if you ask politely
we stayed in at commodore de luxe cabin and it was just perfect for us very good food and drinks aboard and very serviceminded and lovely staff
another very pleasant trip staff helpful and friendly restaurant good value and clean well done to all the staff
i received an email with an offer for a trip to oslo clicked on the link and chose a commodore cabin with balcony it appeared that breakfast was included as it always is with this type of cabin later in the order an amount will be added for breakfast this cannot be opted out i assume its a mistake and contact quotcustomer servicequot i receive an explanation that makes absolutely no sense and the employee says thats just the way it is and tells me that im not the only one who has complained about this i then try to email to get an explanation again an answer i cant use among other things they write that they have now changed the text on the website as several people have quotmisunderstoodquot the message it looks more like an attempt to quotcheatquot the customers as far as im concerned theyve lost a customer misinformationhoax in my and apparently many others opinion
great ship great food extensive breakfast buffet
good trip on time cafe food was decent and reasonably priced ferry was clean and seems to be well maintained our daughter loved the kids area
easy checkin and super catering and stay definitely a good experience that must be repeated
quick boarding and plenty of room to sit comfortably ship clean with good facilities
we have never felt more uncomfortable on a trip we ordered cabins with a small double bed the bed linen was stained we only got one towel and it was so worn and small that there was barely room to let out a fart inside the cabins the beds were so hard that i thought we were lying straight on wooden planks when we complained we were told that we should have paid more and bought premium cabins the reception staff were angry and grumpy the socalled arcade had machines no save your money and find alternative tours dfds is no longer something to collect
on time more environment friendly than flying offers carbon offsetting for below eur very affordable basic cabins
like the cabine did not like the food it mostli was not even warm very little choices of food sorry that noone of your staff felt in charge when passangers were shouting noise on deck may be because of alcohol they also went screeming through the floors it was not possible to rest till midnight
super trip kbh oslo and return gift cards made online ordering a little difficult but everything was resolved by calling customer service breakfast at seas was good both in terms of glutenfree food and good signage we had children with us who could also eat from there our yearold boy had a great experience with all the activities and what he didnt get there he got on the way home a little practice that all outdoor areas are smoking areas and that you do not have the opportunity to buy general groceries or a vending machine with sandwiches for example passport control in oslo seemed a bit oldfashioned and could be updated a bit more quotlanesquot with queues instead of a big lump that has to go through a small door in the end you get what you pay for and i definitely thought it was worth the money
good experience round trip however there are a few small things before you get to the th the passport control in oslo could well be a little more quotcontrolled so that everyone who gets off the ship does not end up standing in a huge crowd and has to through a tiny little door cardboard straws in drinks which cost dkk could well be with plastic recycling unless the idea is to pour the drink into yourself in less than minutes babyfriendly area with microwave to warm bottles and baby food maybe check with the boarding card specifically for baby so that everyone else doesnt just heat up their brought food several people sat and smoked in the sky bar and other outdoor areas despite the fact that it says smoking was allowed at a bit of a shame when you have a baby in a pram and you have to expose him to passive smoking there were unfortunately also ashtrays at the sky bar and we also saw an employee in dfds clothing standing and smoking by the cloud bar the pizzas we paid dkk for each were in no way worth the money one thing is it took min due to queue the base was papery and broke just looking at it very hard to eat not true italian thin base just thin and porous otherwise we had a really good trip on the ship and were satisfied with our small bunk cabin for people great musicfilm quiz and the yearold participated in both horse racing and treasure hunting and got the time to go with div activities its certainly not the last time we travel with dfds but maybe an upgrade of the cabin for a girlfriends trip next time
good room okay food but departure conditions on the boat and terminal are bad
overall good need a light snack option in the evening only socket in cabin was annoying in a cabin for transport to and from amsterdam was excellent evening entertainment good
i enjoyed it our cabin was on the th and that was ideal bingo was fun too bad they didnt do rounds per evening instead of round at breakfast i did miss chocolate milk and a fried and boiled egg
we were told we couldnt travel due to a tech issue as our bike was too high refused us to wheel bike on so we ended up collapsing bike and putting inside the car she couldnt refuse us then super i flexible when problem was on dfds side facilities very poor toilets disgusting food not nice
we a family of four had a great trip from copenhagen to oslo and back the kids age and loved our cabin and the play area the water temperature in the pools could have been a bit warmer with the high living cost in mind it would be so much more family friendly with a picnic area were we could eat our own food or at least more affordable restaurants our ac made a lot of noise and water ran down the wall right on the toilet paper
good company clean cabins the wine was not good and too expensive
many years since my adult son and i have taken the quotdanish boatquot it was time to try something new we cant say we were super satisfied with either the boat the buffet or the cabins but we are simple souls and enjoyed the quiet sea and good drinks on top of the sky bar good service on board from the staff
so much about our trip was great booking was straightforward communication was great check in was easy and our cabin very comfortable plus we were in the commodore floor and the lounge area was very well equipped what totally ruined our trip was the family group specifically the men staying in although there were others who started their party at pm drinking and smoking in their room and on the balcony we were unable to use our balcony or leave our door open because of their smoking and noise there was brief respite in the evening but the men returned to their room at around am and proceeded to continue their drunken partying until am they were raucous loud sang badly and this was fuelled by the lounge bar fridge the wall between their room and ours offered no buffer to their noise and other than move ourselves into the lounge area which was not really appropriate for sleeping there was very little we could do their behaviour was disrespectful of others and absolutely disgusting and completely ruined the trip for us
this time we booked a bed cabin it was perfect for us nice staff well organized it felt like you were watching an anthill every member of staff knew exactly what they had to do the only thing was that the toilet was acting up again just like on our last trip they need to be overhauled and something to keep children between and years old occupied that would be great
newcastleamsterdam staff very unhelpful and hard to understand commodore cabin very outdated very small and dirty no gb programmes on tv feeding time in explorers kitchen like a zoo embarking and disembarking complete chaos massively overpriced
better on board food drink prices and reasonable quality compared to the other companies
cabin was clean and tidy sink stopper was broken so the water couldnt drain away on the outward journey amsterdam newcastle we were booked into a petfriendly cabin even though we didnt have a pet
this is an average score we are very satisfied with the way there stars on the return trip the catering in the explorers kitchen was very poor both at the dinner and breakfast buffets in the sleeping cabin persons with sea view it was very warm at night almost stuffy update after this review dfds customer service contacted me and apologized for poor experiences experience will not prevent us from choosing dfds again next time
friendly staff decent cabin good quality breakfast and dinner there was a rattling barge on the outward journey which caused extra noise
everything was well organised boarding went well and quickly the room was clean and looked good food and drinks were good i just thought the price of a glass of wine was very high staff was friendly in short a nice few days away
we upgraded to premiere lounge what was not to enjoy space and a good selection of snacks and drinks
i honestly would not have bought the trip if i had known what they entailed not cleaned room there was food left in our living room and there was only hand towel and the other duvet we have the duvet cover had not been changed and the room was located by the pool so children were running back and forth in the corridor until pm making so much noise that it shook and there was still noise after until over in addition after people have been no in the toilet the whole hallway smells i wouldnt recommend it for couples at all but would recommend it for people with kids girlfriendsfriends traveling or people traveling multiple
service on board was very good friendly staff everywhere the booked dinner in the north sea restaurant was good and the breakfast in the kitchen restaurant was also good
good connection to newcastle make sure you get a cabin on deck where there is a lot of noise from the ships engines coffee shop closes early buffet food mediocre ships partly faded glory predominantly asian staff work very hard
timely boarding reasonable cateringplenty of seats
easy booking experience good pice smooth logistics both ways comfortable service on the ship always possible to find a great seat somewhere good food
great staff slightly tired ship and food just ok
everything was great the cleanliness the friendliness of the staff everything was just great
on the klaipedakeel trip the service is very disappointing with a newborn in the building on the st floor climbing the stairs with the baby the service guy is sloppy rude he doesnt speak to the receptionist without apologizing i have to wait more than an hour with a baby in my arms for the last car to leave such rude service is very annoying to me im disappointed at least i should have apologized
the experience was very good the room and the ship comfortable personnel was flexible and kind food was good especially in the seas buffet restaurant and the entertainment relaxing but involving
smooth embarkation friendly staff very tasty and extensive international buffet nice bargains in the shop furniture in the bars was renewed cabins are clean but some may need an upgrade
good organization space on board good value for money for food availability to respond to rebooking in several languages
we travelled from newcastle to amsterdam the staff were very friendly and helpful a wide range of choices of food was available up to date films in the onboard cinema to watch and overall a very pleasurable way to travel to the continent will happily use the service again
punctual friendly clean spacious and we even got a seat what more could you want
streamlined company friendly mainly asian service top restaurant comfortable beds good guitarist
the crew is extremely professional and friendly nice cabin with perfectly functioning air conditioning the breakfast buffet was particularly delicious and everything is nice and tasty
goods overall organization information and detailed description of overall processes from before the trip to the unboarding friendly personnel not goods food from prepaid breakfast and lunch has a lot of potential for improvement maybe sacrifice a selection for higher quality
trip is as it ought to be great also people at desks very helpfull one thing the building with dfds writing on it at dunkirk cafe an toilets toilets are very dirty and stench not only once but every visit the same please have something done to it
the staff were incredibly nice and helpful and always with a smile but note the smell of oildiesel several times around the ship and especially byin the cabin and not least the air conditioning in several places on the ship it was downright freezing so we had to get sweatersblankets the last evening in restaurant explorer was extremely cold the food was really good and there was plenty
loved the boat we were on nice space upstairs to enjoy the sun outside on the deck and the restaurant was a pleasant area too with tasty food the only downside was the waiting time for checkin
helpful and friendly staff good food in the restaurant and generally very pleasant experience except for the very noisy young children in the play area
friendly staff and good catering
from start to finish everything worked checkin parking service on board the food perfect in the explorer restaurant friendly waiters with time for a chat departure and arrival times on the battle
good breakfast as usual a good breakfast buffet
unfortunately there were very few vegetarian options at the buffet waterjuice at the buffet tasted like chlorine otherwise we were satisfied
the boat is comfortable the food could be better more vegetarian and vegan options would be an improvement
friendly employees good quality bed great entertainment food and drinks on board a bit expensive though
all very smoothly organized tidy and friendly and at least a reasonable choice of vegetarian options even though if this could be improved thanks
overall everything was satisfactory the cabin for five on the pearl seaways was unfortunately very small the food was good but on the crown seaways it was even better and really excellent the staff and activities were always very good you could put a small mat in the bathrooms for showering
friendly staff competitive price toilets not very clean and not stocked
fast shipping cabins clean if a little dated food very good would definitely recommend dfds
the cabin was neat and tidy the staff was nice and helpful and the food from the menu was very good we had a relaxing trip
pleasant polite staff very clean environment throughout good pricing compared to other channel crossing companies food hall good but breakfast was luke warm almost cold evening meal was good very good offers in duty free onboard shop
some toilets were shut so there were long queues and no loo paper the lady in the perfume shop was very friendly and helpful
staff in restaurant really looked after us when to they found my wife was vegetarian cooked veg sausages specially
the commodore cabin was very good clean very good bed enough space the buffet and the included breakfast was excellent the only comment for improvement we have is the smoking area outside it is almost everywhere allowed to smoke only one small place is non smoking and for the smokers not clear that it is forbidden there so we could not go outside without standing in the smoke we recommend to improve the signs and to increase the amount of non smoking areas outside
toilets should be kept cleaned food was ok but not great
ships on time easy boarding and good fooddrinkgreat experience
great friendly staff clean ship invl cabins clarity of instructions
the lounge service paid place is clean and tidy food could be improved also the sandwiches wrapping was wet from fridge moisture background music could be if soft tunes played
quick to load once through customs good food and helpful staff
commodore cabin recommended buffet restaurant outward journey has a very wide choice something to suit every preference also extensive vegetarian options a la carte restaurant return trip has more limited choice but was also very good the commodore cabin also includes breakfast in the commodore breakfast room there is also a wide choice of smoothies fresh fruit cappuccino and various egg preparations
pricequality ratio is correct on the way there we had a dated cabin the interior of the hut was better on the way back but it was very noisy next time we can take this more into account hospitality was fine
the worst boat company weve travelled with went on an early boat going to calais lots of staff serving hot food but only member of staff taking payment they bought another member of staff after i complained food was cold by the time we sat down childrens play area was not fit for purpose screws sticking out of wood work wood was split down the middle total hs risk toilets were disgusting on both out and return reported to staff on the cigarette counter and was asked if the others were the same its not my job to check i have emailed customer services with photos and have yet to receive a reply
we were able to easily transform our trip and the food was delicious
nice cabins lightly used nice lounge area including snacks and drinks missing a little croissant in the morning
really good food at the seas dinner buffet really delicious and welcoming staff there
it would be desirable to have a childfree area when eating the cabins on the commodore are in serious need of renewal just look at fjord lines comparable cabins where there is better space especially in the bathroom which is cramped dark and very enclosed the cabins seem worn breakfast at the commodore was really excellent
get to see the sailing from oslo be able to have a glass of white wine up aft on the deck in the sun although it wasnt very sweet get to sit together for the buffet although we ordered separately the ventilation hatch in the bathroom in the cabin was not cleaned for a while so it quotswishedquot very unevenly at breakfast you could sit anywherethe troubadour from quotcolor linequot last year was very nice to seehear again helpful people in taxfree and completely chaos on dk before arrival in copenhagen when jg didnt get out of the lift due to quotsea of peoplequot and got to pick up my luggage in the cabin and got to the car on the hanging deckoverall a nice voyage
impeccable service also in connection with changing the booked a single minus the cabin on deck aft is severely affected by noise and vibrations from the ships screws
only one waitress for service on the bar you have to wait until minutes for coffee or beer
on our return trip from oslo the bedding was dirty very bad
service ran on time and onshore staff were great boat was tired with broken fittings and worn seating shop had no stock of makeup sale items in on board brochure
relaxed and pleasant environment worse judgment at the oslo terminal the train takes too long there were a lot of people going out at the same time through a small door
personnel was smiley helpful and responsive i found prices reasonable except some in the tax free shop food and drinks were great
good service and friendly staff a minus was location in the seaside seating lounge chairs experienced several families that were spread out on several rows then swapped amongst themselves but it should be possible to make it so that when you order together you get the seats next to each other
good but not very good food on the way back was better than on the way there too few rest areas
good food departure and arrival on time beds a bit short small cabin
food was apalling cold tasting funny and on top of everything it was priced as a michelin star restaurant not many things that couldve gone wrong turned out good during the trip
easy check in and assistance getting motorbike secured for journey very pleasant crew in restaurant and shop
staff are helpful and friendly duty free shop is spacious and well stocked restaurant has tasty vegetarian dish understand the problems but would love to bring the dog up to enjoy our brilliant trip
the boat left hours late that can happen due to weather conditions however the boat was extremely dirty and smelled like vomit in the restaurant the girls in the store let the young man at the cash register do all the work they were not attentive to the queue waiting to pay
the cabins are small and cramped the bathroom basically has a toilet because it has a toilet in the shower there is carpet on the floor so hygiene does not exist i slept in the bed higher than the bunk bed and its like sleeping on a wooden plank considering how much it costs to travel with this bagnarola its shameful the cars were crowded together and did not leave enough space for pedestrians to pass to leave the ship and reach the car deck there were absolutely no signs to indicate the way and the stairs on the fourth deck stop and dont allow you to get to the third and anyway it doesnt say where to go so i had to climb floors of stairs to reach the elevators
absolutely wonderful will never fly again to europe the service from staff in the call centre the border patrol dfds staff on the ship were phenomenal we had a full cooked breakfast was also very delicious on the way out we used the lounge honestly brilliant all the foodsnacks and drinks you could need overall brilliant highly recommended thank you dfds
the staff were very friendly and helpful the cabin was clean but we missed soap in the dispenser and a shower rug on the floor it got quite slippery after showering we also enjoyed our meals good value for money
positive fast checkin punctuality fair catering prices good coffee negative hygiene of toilets outdoor terraces need to be renovated the floor paint flies into your face when the wind blows too few quiet areas below deck partitions would be helpful to reduce the enormous noise no nonfood areas food smells are omnipresent and unpleasant
nice experience very warm in the rooms this heat was throughout the entire ship otherwise clean rooms and friendly staff
booking process relatively simple and selfexplanatory pleasant way to start a vacation and cover long distances breakfast buffet plentiful and delicious traveling with a dog you have to complete the booking first and then call again if you want to keep the dog in your cabin pet cabins are on the lowest deck level it feels like youre sleeping directly above the engine room loud there is only one dog area at the end of the ship a small area on levels has been separated off for the dogs the rest of the ship is off limits they are supposed to relieve themselves on two patches of artificial turf it smells horribly very unloving trip itself is great traveling with a dog a lot of room for improvement
the premium lounge is a joke only crisps biscuits macaroons danish pastries available not even prepacked sandwiches as it was sunday poor selection of drinks definitely not worth paying extra for and would not recommend we will never travel with dfds again po is far superior
check in staff were all great shame the coffee on board was so expensive otherwise it would be stars
quiet and pleasant crossing good buffet
there was no possibility to just eat a little something like a portion of chips or something similar
i think there is a lack of places where you can sit properly where you dont have to be in a restaurant or cafe and buy something although it is probably by design that it is like that
well signposted to the port and smooth checkin we cycled on board and it went perfectly the cabins were fresh and we slept well the ship felt fresh the restaurants were good as were the bar environments the store is also quite ok nice staff if you would like something more it is in that case a movie corner in the evening and that adults dont only have sports to watch if you dont hang out in the bar
the cabins are in dire need of updating and the bath was black with mold the exhaust didnt work at all otherwise a nice trip and the restaurant areas seemed delicious and inviting we had been looking forward to some delicious dinner in seven seas and the buffet was also full of immediately delicious things which were nicely presented but unfortunately most of it didnt really taste like anything
the quality of the room and food was not equal to the price a very expensive trip the breakfast has worsened over the last few years no choice of boiled eggs and only uht milk for example the games in amusement room are often out of order the staff are friendly
the crew is ever so friendly and helpful the buffet is really good and there is a very good choice
breakfast buffet no bad many empty dishes at winer bread sloshed together in bowls too bad that you cant come to your cabin in oslo and pick up things before sailing again
efficient and pleasant staff food range mediocre
a good trip as always but we had ordered the evening buffet in advance but stood in line for minutes the same was true in the morning but here only for about minutes normally it runs like clockwork and i hope it will get better in the future
i gave four stars overall for the return trip departure from oslo with pearl seaways and return with crown seaways we had buffet in the evening and breakfast both ways buffet in the evening and breakfast on the return at crown seaways was super not so good at pearl seaways
the food and staff are as expected very great but unfortunately there were a lot of children where we were supposed to sleep in the cabin and a lot of noise from them otherwise we had an unexpected stop in fredrikshavn but as mentioned overall the journey was good
got a cabin right by the gangway this makes it difficult to sleep when you are lying in frederikshavn from at night and there is an enormous amount of noise cabin and toilet very worn ventilation in toilet broken
i have mobility issues and the help i was given was excellent the staff were professional and friendly food was exceptional and cabins very clean great value for money
we stood on deck three rows of cars at our age it is really not comfortable to have to get out of your car like that we are not used to this from you the employee was laughing at how we had to crawl out of the car he had definitely been in the car for too long he said so really not no recommendation to travel with you again
cabins were clean but small air circulation wasnt that good so it felt stuffy extensive buffet in the restaurant but not tasty cold food and dried out that wasnt worth the money
as a family we have been with dfds many many times where we have always gone with great pleasure and joy but this time was different worse than before the first day we had not booked a table at any of the restaurants i asked an employee at little italy how it worked with ordering and was told that we just had to come when we wanted to eat at thought we were appropriate here we were greeted by a provided beeper which would beep when the table was ready that was it hours later had we known we would of course have picked it up a bit sooner there were several free tables in there which surprised us when there were more people in line the next day we had booked a table in seas we were people and at a price of dkk incl drinks we as a family had expectations that there were full dishes and a large selection of vegetables when we finished eating we wanted to pay we sat and waited for minutes for the waiter who had served us but as she was not to be scoffed at i grabbed the first one that came by here i was greeted by the message that he did not know exactly where our servant was after minutes of waiting we managed to be allowed to pay the breakfast also at seas again an expectation of full platters and a larger selection of fruit such as melon we think there is an imbalance in price quality and service you can certainly do better it will be a very long time before we go on such a trip again
smooth operation great buffet unfortunately all drinks are charged separately which makes the buffet a decoy offer very punctual and well organized
really nice experience super friendly staff and really good food will definitely come again
it was really easy and it worked really well with the room key and ordering food from home being registered together on the boarding card
perfect nothing to complain about except the slightly high prices at the restaurant
we had our cabin upgraded which was probably due to orders i made very satisfied with both cabin food and good service
a good end to our holiday in norway could have used a tv in the cabin no hand soap at the sink and the toilet seat was loose wifi is way too expensive in free or cheaper wifi is expected
the boat trip itself was very nice the food and offers on board lived up to expectations and the service was also pleasant but the cabin was in poor condition and was on deck which is covered over car tyres loud engine noise and car alarms blaring on the deck below led to a miserable night for the family on
recliner chairs were extremely uncomfortable also too light in the quiet areas noisy staff walking around on overnight crossing when people are trying to sleep too many tannoy announcements when trying to get to sleep
friendly staff lots of space on board nice trip
first of all at the check in personnel vert kind despite the traffic and even speaking italian our languagethan we decided to make use of the lounge considering the amount of people and the fact there were practically no seat left everybody were keeping seat occupied by bags and or laying sleeping blocking seatsfor us lounge was the alternative and we were very satisfied
it was a good cabin on the way up on the way down the cabin was hard to find a long way out into the wind if you didnt want to climb uncomfortable stairs the buffet was on the best was the breakfast grateful for good captain and friendly staff
this was the first time we had used the service and we found it to be a very efficient operation with friendly staff comfortable cabins and good facilities the quality of the food in the a la carte restaurant was fantastic
everything went well the food was very tasty
easy to book online the ship is clean and tidy and has many facilities i think it would be good if you could choose the cabin based on which deck you want we had a buffet on both the outing and the return trip and i think there should be better cutlery for the dishes the food stuck to the cutlery furthermore no cloth was placed around the loaves so everyone touched them with their hands when cutting
everything went very well the cabin was clean as expected the various bars and other offerings offered a lot of variety the booked food and the breakfast buffet were very good
this was the second time we took this and unfortunately it was probably the same as last time small taxfree and messy if you take strmstadsandefjord it is incredibly much better than this we chose the buffet restaurant for lunch and it was perfectly fine but this will probably be our last trip by boat overpriced and not worth the money take the car or fly instead
boat was nice and clean cabin was nice boarding at amsterdam was slow and a bit disorganised and there were not enough options for those of us with dogs who couldnt do sit down dining
checkin was fast cabin was perfect good buffet dinner restaurant and sufficient seats all over the ship
we booked two cabins as we are travelling with small kids we were given two cabins so far away one on deck and other on deck when i requested to atleast have onthe same deck i was told sorry we cant help very cold response all my trip was ruined as because of small kids me and my partner had to split up we couldnt enjoy the trip as it didnt feel like we were travelling a s a family the room were not cleaned when we got off t oslo dirty sheets and towels
we had a commodore delux cabin and had to pay an additional x for breakfast in the cabin this should be communicated better we didnt know beforehand that the cabin had a fridge important because of the baby otherwise very satisfied especially with the handling of the baby
friendly staff and good activities for children can recommend buying childrens tickets
clean and nice cabin calm and quiet meant a good nights sleep the only problem was that we drove to the wrong port in paldiski so you should inform more clearly that you should not follow the signs to kapellskr luckily we made it just when we had figured out where we were going
friendly helpful staff cabin was comfortable and clean dinner buffet was tasty and wide choice of dishes
grumpy waiters at seas and car alarms that ruined the nights sleep
when we arrived earlier than planned we were able to board the boat immediately and the ticket was automatically converted the food is excellent and the staff always nice
a good trip experience but very little halal food little focus on it from dfdss side and it is a bit sad as it is a buying group on an equal footing with others otherwise a good crew and skilled sailors who navigate without difficulty in all kinds of weather neat and tidy conditions
far to low temperatur in restaurant ond cabin less than gr c slow handling in restaurant waited min for starter soup interiour in restaurant very simpel more like a kafeteria or mc donalds we have family in denmark for the future we will most probebly drive all the way in stead of by boat
easy to locate busget on ship nice staff lovely food
hi there travelled with you in february and again over the last week i booked a internal cabin on the previous trip when i got on the ship and paid this time you wanted several heard this and walked away then it was announced cabins were available which at the highly inflated price is not surprising second is there is nowhere that could be considered a quiet space for drivers at night two many lights on fully appreciate health and safety but over the top of the the seats i am sure could be turned off as the walkway ones would still be on the worst of the trip home yesterday was the group of spanish drivers who had a competition to see who could talk the loudest all at the same time outside duty free they woke me up so i went upstairs but the sound was still at an annoying level they did nothing wrong with no designated quiet area so tough on everyone who needs to have a sleep not sure you can do anything with the shape and age of the vessel but would appreciate your reply on the above thank you richard
it quickly became emptysmall selection at the breakfast buffet as well as a small selection of dessert for dinner at the buffet we had a wine tasting where the staff arrived late poorly prepared and lacking knowledge on certain points had to google the wine the room was not cleaned no hand towels were given had to wait for the cabin to be prepared even though they hadnt touched ours
mostly pleasant staff very bad cabin noisy and impossible to sleep not clean fairly average food in the restaurants at a rather expensive price
checking in was extremely easy and quick and the staff were friendly throughout the dog cabin on the king was a bit more spacious than on the princess but unfortunately something rattled quite a bit apart from the noise of the engines the dog toilet is easy to reach but there are stairs not suitable for older dogs the buffet in the explorers kitchen was delicious
as always good experiences on board amp smiling staff and not least good cabins amp not to forget the food
we had been looking forward to taking the ferry from oslo to copenhagen for the first time at there were babies in diapers on the dance floor when the husbands band played at the nightclub on deck i wonder why you serve beer and drinks from the bar at the same time and plan a fun evening for adults can this be correct and legal will not take or recommend such a tour for other adults who wish to use their tours terrible descent even though we tried to dance a bit and of course were unlucky and tripped over a child
no check in queue after this positive start the rst of the trip was similarly positive the crew were friendly and helpful and the food was of good quality
punctuality friendliness on board delicious food both in the evening and for breakfast
good food at the buffet restaurant the cabin was worn the bunks are uncomfortable and it was not properly cleaned
all in all a good experience but in relation to the price and our expectations for the cabin we only land on a small er we had chosen a deluxe cabin where we were placed on deck at the back which is obviously close to the ships machine roomrooms there was an incredible amount of noise in the room especially at night when we had to go in to frederikshavn and out again those cabins should be called something a la deluxe with noise
i liked the service at the restaurant we ate at i did not like the price level of the boat generally way too expensive in addition very messy in clothing stores
the bookings went very smoothly the staff was very friendly and helpful
the breakfast buffet was good but the cabin on crown was very very worn and not least dirty it was almost disgusting to be there not much activity for the older children pearl is better there
we had a nice trip with the oslo boat the children enjoyed themselves and there were many fun activities and good restaurant options unfortunately we had been given a room where the toilet was defective it was very noisy and water ran from the toilet onto the bathroom floor the staff on board were quick to help get the toilet done so it didnt make any more noise but it still didnt flush properly we were not offered to have the room cleaned until the next day when we complained for the second time and we were not offered any kind of compensation for not being able to use our bathroom and for it being dirty and unhygienic
time table was spot on staff were very helpful as usual prices are very good on board food was second to none
for the price we paid i thought the cabins were better it was old and worn but despite that we had a nice night sailing from frederikshavn in clean and delicious bedding
it all works efficiently boarding finding cabins lots and lots of staff around to guide you the crossing etc cabins are very hot and stuffy and the aircon is not really ac more an inefficient form of blowing around a bit of air we all struggled to sleep no matter the temperature outside we ate in the restaurant both ways not the buffet it did not disappoint we learned a few years ago that ferry restaurants are usually great quality and now it is a great kick off to our holiday excellent fresh fish great scallops very good wine list we made use of the dog hotel too although the outside space for dogs is very small
we liked the food and the baraera the room however could realy need a makeover in the bathroom there was mold on the ceiling
good food pleasant service and a good atmosphere a bit noisy in seven seas next time we will have dinner in explorer
very good service nice staff the waiter at the evening buffet exceeded all expectations you learn that job calling the customer is taken seriously wed be happy to come back
the total package great service all the way through great food and great selection and a really wonderful experience all in all and special mention must be made of the beer and wine tasting at nicolajs which was a positive and happy experience on the ship thank you very much for the trip and we will happily return back
punctual departure good organization spacious seating clean toilets
signage is clear fine friendly employees good guidance on boat restaurant is fine in short great
breakfast was good signage for cabins and car decks was poor
fast boarding microsoft food in the priority lounge
generally nice and welcoming staff but a few are more busy selling than providing service we lacked that there were seatingrest areas where staff are not running around where we sell goods if you want just a bit of peace and quiet then there is only the cabin and the neighbours children are also noisy so there is no peace here either of course its a shame that it rained so you couldnt really be out but now we have rested after we got home
everything was easy from loading to unloading food is as good as the staff are to talk to
treat it to dieppenewhaven nothing to say regarding the route of the ship the stay as always fantastic we often use it since we have a dog and it is the best way to always take it with us today i want to focus on the staff of the bar on the first floor which happened this morning at i went to the bar and asked for espressos paid and i literally got small americano full of water to the edge since i love the single shot of coffee without any addition of extra water i asked if it was possible to have single shot of coffee without added water and the man over and black moustache with a gold ring on the left initially looked at me bewildered telling me that that was espresso i insisted saying that i wanted only and exclusively single shots of coffee without extra water not understanding my request he started mocking me with alpha male air he told me to go behind the bar absurdly bad service customers and he called a colleague of his speaking in french in front of me despite the fact that he knew i cannot understand anything moral of the story i threw away the coffees but passing an espresso for a small american is not what wasted money and finally i pointed out to him his rude gesture and he kept snorting in my face and in front of his manager never seen such a thing
the first evening was spent in an icy cold room as the air conditioning was broken the next day the kids were snotty after dialogue back and forth late in the evening we got a new room where the climate worked the climate in general on the ship was freezing the red beef was almost not cooked in the expensive restaurant on board and the staffwaiters apologized for the many guests and that their staff could not keep up
unfortunately the trip wasnt that great the ship is a little tired in places buffet food was ok la carte restaurant wasnt great our first room on level was very very noisy from the engine and rattled continuously so avoid level as its like sleeping in the engine room we asked to be moved and lucky we got moved to a room on level which was much better noise wise good point staff were friendly would we do it again probably not
pros good food in the restaurant nice shows cons very noisy cabine the ship is shaking all the time and crossing is much more expensive than other crossings
delicious food friendly service
staff very friendly and always approachable however the website is not ideal for pet owners you cannot book a petfriendly cabin there
evening meal was delicious
a very clean tidy boat efficient helpful staff and beautiful seating areas inside and out
the cabin was quite small and the bathroom took some getting used to for us tall people the breakfast was ok the cabin was clean and everything was freshly prepared the lunch was reasonably
friendly staff and good food boarding is slow and cabins too warm
surprisingly there were no food options there for vegans being an indian i tried hard to get some asian food and some vegans but i feel disappointed
not enough toilets on board filthy relax lounge no aircon wc terminal building dunkirk filthy
this was our th trip miniferie trip and we keep going back for the good experience and making memories however since last times it has been ruined by the morning breakfast staff waiters unfortunately both times we received impolite and arrogant waiters who were not customer minded at all today morning after breakfast we wanted to switch the table and have our tea next to the window when i requested the old tall waiter with glasses to clean the table next to window he said you cannot change every time and left and this was the only time i requested to switch i went and asked why did he said so and he kept saying he didnt say anything which was an upfront lie it eventually ruined morning mood for us i noticed him arguing with another lady sitting behind us it doesnt cost anything to be polite but unfortunately those basic manners are missing in some of the waiters there during our last trip also there was a lady waiter who was too busy to answer my queries on vegetarianvegan food she was walking while i was trying to talk to her but had time to stop and talk to a white lady and explain her i found her behaviour very discriminating the experience i had in with the breakfast staff at seas was really bad and next time i will reconsider many times to take this ferry because i want my mornings to start with harmony and smiles the only thing to balance this bad experience was with the kind manager on th floor and lady at the reception who took the request who helped us with the step for my old father and came during the night to help us i am really thankful to him for his consideration and help so all the stars in this review are for him
a better experience than expected had read previous reviews on trustpilot and similar to my own experience last summer there were several aspects that could be better eg quality of food service mindedness among the staff this time experienced a wonderful morning buffet and staff who created a friendly and welcoming atmosphere
cabin really nice staff very helpful buffet was lovely and it all was a nice start to a weeks holiday much more civilized than flying there were only issues upon arrival at royal quays on return there seemed to be confusion over which deck the walkway was going to be from could be a rq issue but this led to issue which was groups of people predominantly younger using the staircases as seats and blocking people getting past it may be handy if staff could monitor this and act accordingly to keep staircases and walkways clear for foot passengers other than that which are minor and not neceserally a dfds issue a lovely trip was had
good helpfulness from staff pleasant facilities on board would suggest glutenfree dishes i still am unsure what these were on yesterdays crossing could this be made a little clearer and could serving staff have a clear understanding of what gluten free actually entails please cabin very good but could you please provide a little soap in the toiletshower cubicle not very hygienic to dry unclean hands on towels and carry germs around the passenger areas
we had a triple cabin with a window the ventilation in the cabin was extremely poor the music in the outside sky bar was horrible monotonous and inappropriate constant salsa and merengue on repeat
the staff on board were super friendly and helpful the food was great we really enjoyed the trip
the cabins with windows are particularly good and pleasant the beds are just right everything is clean and the person cabin for two people is good for sharing overall the cleanliness on the ship was exemplary the staff in the buffet restaurant were not friendly though unfortunately the evening meal also consisted largely of or different meat dishes only one fish dish left a lot to be desired it was almost cold small cubes of thickly breaded salmon hard and not very tasty there wasnt even any sauce or melted butter the soup only contained canned vegetables which is not what i expect for these prices the salad selection was good though the cake and fresh fruit are good the bread selection is also good unfortunately the room temperature in the restaurant area was much too cool which meant that the food got cold even faster
the price was very competitive the food was certainly okay the mattresses in our cabin needed to be replaced
very professional staff in the trying conditions very strong winds so making the boat roll more
straightforward boarding good food and good service on board plenty of room and comfortable seats for sleeping
very good and efficient but one negative comment six of us had struck camp near le mans at in the morning and drove to dieppe with nothing to eat looking forward to the usual full breakfast on the ship it was not available to be fair the lunch was good
really good experience and professional and friendly crew good food throughout the trip only downside is that they dont have coke on board at all as they only have pepsi which all reasonable people know isnt real coke in order to achieve stars dfds should make an arrangement that you can postpone your mini cruise if you can see on the weather forecast that a storm is coming as this experience really ruined the return voyage big time because you get really seasick if there will be winds of to mtr in short order
friendly welcome on the boat everything is well organized buffets are diverse tasty and conveniently arranged glad you can go outside it was quiet at our cabin it was way too hot in the hut so we didnt sleep very well we only saw at a late stage that you could slightly adjust the temperature of the ventilation on the ceiling
very limited catering from shortly after sailing shop closed likewise
boarding very quick sailing smooth food was very dry and service was quite poor otherwise not to bad a crossing would use again but will pack my own lunch next time
boarding was supposed to start during the outward journey which did not happen after a while police cars came off the boat there will of course be reasons for that what i really miss is an announcement on the information boards that boarding starts in minutes or something like that keep your customers informed to prevent frustration nothing needs to be said about the incident itself the return journey was very uneventful there were about people in the restaurant we wanted to have lunch on board so we didnt have to stop along the way the food had clearly been there for a while fries that were dried up and lukewarm the roasted half chicken did not have a crispy skin and was no longer properly warm the fish was also dry and the batter had dried hard on the edges so i wouldnt recommend this to anyone i would look at systems that are prepared on request especially when it is so quiet
the service on board cabins staff on board are friendly
ferry dover dunkirk we always ate fish amp chips in the restaurant the portion is now very small and the quality has also decreased significantly
the whole experience was great from the food to the small and clean cabin to the staff always available to help
arrived on time friendly staff comfortable pullman seats clean sanitary facilities everything was great
smooth ontime sailing passenger areas pleasant and modern with enough seating sadly only pizzas at lighthouse restaurant would have preferred a salad but not available would have been nice if picture windows were cleaned of salt spray dfds always my first choice you treat your workforce well unlike po
was not bad in itself but there are several areas for improvement including the food buffet on the first day super on the second day you get the same food then you have to eat one deck lower and you get the leftovers from the day before i find that antisocial and there were a few little things that you have something like that right this is what you expect when starting up such a company but not with a company that has been exploring this crossing for years but the food on day is really not nice hello tom i have sent emails to you you asked me to contact you via the details below trustpilotreviewsdfds i also tried reviewsdfds but it has now been more than a week later havent had a response yet
prompt sailing times helpful and friendly crew clean ship and great food
staff were great and very helpful our cabin was lovely and clean
competive price on time nice crew poor menu choice for vegetarians
cabin as expected however we could have wished for a double bed and completely ok as well as an excellent buffet and service
took a minicruise and overall a good experience the ship is old but nicely renovated and kept clean cabins are small but you have all you need only bad thing in the cabin was the temperature too warm the airconditioning didnt seem to make much difference the buffet was really good value for money when booked in advance if you dont eat at the restaurants well then there isnt much to eat at all would be nice if you can just get a simple sandwich somewhere on board also if you dont get the breakfast in the morning there is only one place to get a coffee and you have to wait in a long line staff are very friendly and helpfull
transport was well arranged temperature in the hut was a bit too high the food dinner buffet and breakfast were a bit disappointing
everything went well checkin was problemfree and on time the cabins are getting old we would still book again
barely enough space to open car door to get out lukewarm coffee cooked breakfast was very small halved in fact
so we set off yesterday evening a bit of a long wait but ok take lane those are the first so getting on the ship was easier than expected small turning maneuvers but no real problem the cabin was perfectly adequate for one night really very quiet journey you do have to queue for food though the selection is sufficient and tastes good too of course not a gourmet temple could be a bit warmer there are a few iron benches on deck to sit on so take a cushion or blanket with you a few seats or loungers here would be great too thats it for now
friendly staff generally very smooth boardingdisembarking
another very nice trip felt like a little cruise everything was good from the food to the cleanliness communication during boarding could be improved though
decor tired and wow how expensive is the food and snacks
left on time good seats on board hospitable catering staff excellent nb it is a pity that there are no facilities during the waiting time on the quay such as a pleasant waiting area and more options for something to eat and drink you are now hanging around the car and that after often a long car journey
the crew were very helpful with every question i asked i am gluten freeand they managed to cook for me a lovely steak with chips and salad
overall a super trip i think that drinks on board are too expensive compared to prices in denmark dkk for beer in international waters
loading unloading mins to get off after docking still no restaurant open
good price and both journeys on time on return journey hot snacks were quite depleted toilets near upper bar need a little attention
really good cabin and nice outdoor area close by when traveling with a dog a disadvantage however is that the door close to the outside area and the cabin makes a lot of noise and is used by staff when they have to go outside and smoke a notice has been put up to close the door and not let it slam but this is not respected others must have been bothered by this before me since the note has been posted
everything was good friendly and helpful staff the evening buffet is really recommended
after notification on the door of the booked cabin report to the information desk it was reported that the booked cabin could not be used after asking whether it was possible to get an upgrade to another cabin we received an upgrade to a person commedore cabin at no extra cost and breakfast at the cabin
everything was really super professional punctual clean excellent food in the buffet restaurant great entertainment program on board cabins clean and beds comfortable very friendly and helpful staff
the booking process and getting onto and off the ship on the outward and inbound trips was excellent staff were polite and helpful generally as well as in the restaurants and duty free shop the toilets were clean and functional as they should be my only areas for improvement would be the lack of gluten free food in the cafe and the quality of the sausages in the main restaurant being very poor get that sorted and this would have been a five star review
coming in to calais the driver was driving at inch a minute turns out someone broke the ramp minute delay got back to the port and they were just loading the ship think delay was due to delay before they were loading the ship with cars your rude worker came over and looked at our ticket and just said no cars were left behind we have been like that before and told you can go on so a ship like that cant fit small cars joke then go into the calais duty free shop wanted to spend to get a free ticket for next duty free run the shop is large with a lot of stock went to the counter to pay and get tobacco no tobacco sir another joke a duty free shop with no tobacco i now know that its all a big con do an offer then no stock still waiting for a reply to my last complaint weeks ago got on the ship late late leaving total waste of a day walking on the ship i come to some seat that had been ripped to bits by some wild creature now in the english channel waiting for the next nightmare one good thing i will not be eating the food on the ship around weeks ago i wanted fish and chips but no was offered chicken and chips cant remember what other things took a bite of the chicken it was covered in wallpaper paste i was close to vomit never in my life anything so vile it was also cold had a chip so cold i had to leave that table before i was sick just writing this gives me nightmares i could give you the cost of what was given your cost p to if your buyer is rubbish there was one funny thing to day when over the speaker it was said the ramp sounded like rudder was not working all the crew were working hard to fix it took a number of photos showing workers just watching funny hard work even your lies are lies now waiting for the boat to break down and drift for days with nothing to eat will post the pictures to back up my wasted day with you now the ship is making a loud rattling noise
very friendly staff the meals are very good i thought the internet on board was quite expensive
low price comfy clean cabin polite helpful staff good food perfect
nice clean and tidy boat plenty of staff organised check in no alternative milk in cafe overall very happy
easy and very little stress getting there and boarding unfortunately the food was not at its best this time cold very small portions and a hair on one of our meals which was exchanged for an even smaller portion
boarding went smoothly clean cabin tasty buffet and breakfast friendly staff
very friendly crew good reception as soon as you come on board delicious food well prepared and extensive cabins are standard but this does not have to be included worth repeating
on time and comfortable seats on board
too many children running around the ship no peace at all
not a big meal but it was just sufficient shop is good for alcohol friendly service
staff friendly and helpful lovely food
easy processing of the formalities comfortable and spacious cabin very good food in the restaurant journey exceeded our expectations
very easy checkin very good cabin great breakfast buffet friendly and helpful staff everywhere i will recommend it
good service everywhere on the ship but too loud music in the lagoon bar in the evening it was impossible to talk together and
good life in the sky bar good food in explorers steakhouse cleaning in the room could be improved beds ok
very friendly staff boarding was efficient
checking in was super fast we were boat terborg and were still able to come along food was okay and everything went smoothly and quickly top
ship very cleaned every where the cars are parking in comfortable way the crew in longe and duty free very kind
we had a great time on boardstaff very friendly also on the quayslept well on deck on the way outon the way back on deck i think right above the engines that was really not niceit felt like you were in an mri scan tunnel all nighteven with earplugs in you couldnt sleep wellit was in princess seaways cabin everything else was very satisfactoryalso the food at the buffet was really excellent
it was a great trip with the king seaways the breakfast buffet and dinner buffet in the explorers kitchen were excellent with a lot of choice the crew was very helpful and friendly and despite a very small cabin i thought it was fine even the shower was nice and warm but there is also room for improvement outside after you have grabbed the railing you are covered in paint grit and when loading the motorcycle i did not find the staff helpful you are a bit left to your own devices fortunately other motorcyclists help unloading also took a very long time and it was hot in the vehicles not nice when you are in your warm motorcycle clothing but i can imagine that this was due to the crowds at customs in summary a great trip but there are some areas for improvement
nice cabin for a few hours in oslo i really missed being able to buy coca cola in the restaurant and shop its a shame that it was only possible to buy pepsi
we came home from a trip from copenhagen oslo yesterday a mini cruise we have already complained but did not want to accept a new trip for nok we get a cabin where there is faeces on the wall by the toilet in addition there is a lot of dirt with dust food scraps etc all the way along the bed so my allergies are going crazy in addition it is insanely noisy in our cabin the whole trip fans running and crazy noise from the machinery when we dock in fredeikshavn it shakes so much and makes so much noise that things fall down everything on the boat is insanely expensive unrealistic prices in their restaurants and very little service from some of the waiters their duty free is also insanely expensive i am an early pensioner and have invested a lot of money to give my son an experience which unfortunately did not go as expected yes i choose not to accept a new minicruise as it is not realistic financially for us to leave again in addition i would just like to say that what they call the pool area consists of a small jacuzzi for people and a very small pool where you cannot swim or anything practice experience
troublefree and pleasant at the ports a nice sailing as well good catering which was not expensive
timely travelling quality of food buffets seems to have decreased since less choice
efficient service and great seven seas restaurant
the school children onboard had no supervision there were several hundred running wild
overall a wonderful experience the cabin was just small enough and then exactly the same buffet on the return journey could perhaps be changed a little one way
easy and quick loading and unloading helpful staff and comfortable chairs and bunks
in the quotnight clubquot i clearly ask for a nonalcoholic drink as i am pregnant and the waiter shows me them on the menu card i choose a mojito without alcohol and one of those in my party orders a mojito with it when the same waiter comes back with our drinks he switches around the one with alcohol and the one without he assures me that the one i get is without alcohol i could taste this was not the case when i took a sip of it on arrival there was only single mans duvet for people the food was extremely satisfying
food was very very poor otherwise a good trip
friendly service nice cabin
the cabin staff are helpful and the rooms are clean and cosy the ship runs punctually and the pricing is competitive its great to check in very very stress free all around excellent
loading and unloading efficient recliners showing their age and quite uncomfortable
as always dfds gave us an enjoyable trip the only fault i could find was on the return journey the breakfast on four seasons restaurantthe bacon was hard and over cooked and the sausage was rubbery and tasteless but everything else ok thanks dfds
the staff are friendly helpful and motivated the cabins are great the dinner buffet is great too the only thing that isnt so good is that during peak times between pm and pm too many people are allowed into the room at once which then gets too crowded we received a text message with the bitra saying that because of the large number of passengers on the day of travel we should come earlier instead of pm to speed up the checkin process which we did in the end we just waited because the examination area didnt open its doors until pm this wait was actually unnecessary overall though we had a great travel experience
had the best weekend not sure why anyone leaves a bad review staff are so lovely everyone you pass say hello always happy to help buffet food was also really nice prices no more than your local town cant wait to come do it again
very poor sound insulation also the bed is not clean
boarding and the offerings on board were surprisingly varied and well organized the food selection in the onboard restaurants was appropriate and everything we tried was very good of course you have to weigh up the prices although the onboard cafe is more or less the same price as starbucks booking one of the onboard restaurants in advance is highly recommended if you want to there was a small quiz rally for the families but at least one family member needs to be able to speak english the actual accommodation was good as expected fourbed quotbunkquot cabin bed linen and towels clean mattresses relatively comfortable if you like quotmedium hardquot the only downside on the return journey the toilet had an odor problem tolerable but worth mentioning
we found the dog walking area downright dirty you can smell all the urine from afar and so you walk into the hallway and into your cabin this place really needs to be hosed down several times it would also make more sense if the cabins and exhaust were on the same deck
the food was good and the staff were pilote
great service on time not many seats available outside and those that were are very dirty overall very good value
nice mini cruise at the weekend in week really good food explorer and seas good drinks and nice entertainment but most of all i must highlight the young man who stood in the clothing department in the tax free store extremely service minded accommodating friendly and patient i didnt get the impression of someone who was just in a job for the sake of it as you can otherwise experience in many clothing stores but rather someone who excelled in his profession i am always indecisive when it comes to shopping for clothes but i feel that i got the best service and guidance and therefore ran with the title of owner of a lot of new wardrobe items big kudos to the seller makmutmahmoud and i hope to bump into you again on the next mini cruise
bad buffet the hot was cold and the cold was hot beef the meat tough and cold cold potatoes and cold ribs people together and the same experience
good clean ship seven sisters good food helpful crewreturn trip departure was delayed by mins approx but made up time crossing
inside the room is was very loudbecause of the machinesdifferent than on the way to newcastlewe couldnt sllep because of heavy vibrationswe had on the way to newcastle we had better also the area for the digs is pretty pooronly m with stones our puppy couldnt pee and kept it for more than hours the breakfast was good
good service clean rooms the neighbours were very loud this was a downside because we were traveling with small children who wake up frequently the water in the cabin wasnt really warm which was a shame cause we wanted to warm up a bottle of milk for our baby we also decided not to shower because of this
it all worked fine checkin was quick and easy the cabin we had was with its own bath and window very comfortable good service in the restaurant and good food
a really good experience in the buffet restaurant fine food and friendly service in the columbus bar the entertainment was poor poorly coordinated between the music and the singers the singers must have had a bad night because they sang falsely and couldnt reach the high notes even if they tried it was poor the cabin was nice it was quiet apart from the music it was a nice trip
had a good journey no delay arrived on time boarding and leaving went very quickly the coffee was tasty the food was good the crew friendly and helpful
competent fast customer service punctual petfriendly clean cabins delicious buffet friendly staff opportunity for improvement also offer cabins for two pets improve dog toilets
straightforward checkin clear guidance on boarding good facilities on board with plenty of food choices and duty free shopping plenty of staff around
we had a really great time everything went smooth the food in the exploresr kitchen was fine the only thing that could have been better was the noise from the engine i didnt really sleep well because i am very sensitive to sound and this kept me awake for most part of the nights
the noise in the room of the dog hotel the dog is well behaved and quiet but cannot sleep due to the noise of the engine maybe better soundproof walls in these areas or perhaps earplugs the food was very good the bill became much too high due to circumstances i had to advance the return journey several times and had to pay twice
love everything except the food in board which is limited and mediocre newhaven terminal unwelcoming scruffy and without facilities staff all friendly and fantastic
we brought our granddaughters on a mini cruise to amsterdam we found it to be really well organised the food in the explorers kitchen was amazing lots of choice and very good quality the girls really enjoyed the cinema and we also thought the live entertainment was great the staff were very friendly and helpful and always on hand without being intrusive i think dfds have really got things right we realise space is a premium but a slightly bigger games area would be an asset somewhere for young teens to hang out im being really picky now but the wine choice in the bars is not great but this is picking at straws because the whole trip was really enjoyable many thanks to all at dfds
everything seemed to run smoothly and on time the food in the cafeteria was decent and the french lady serving it was friendly and thoughtful
good food friendly staff clean ship a small minus is that you cannot buy a cup of coffee at when sailing into the oslofjord in general it must be possible to buy or withdraw coffee from on the whole trip keld
dirty cabin had to change cabin no soap in the shower no table between the beds we travel a lot and would like to enjoy a good meal but the menu in restaurant explorer is always the same boring one and not very tasty the food in seven seas was very good the waiter lost interest in her guests after a while and seemed more busy with cleaning after the guests difficult to call her to our table
the unforeseen cancellation of our outward booking was very short notice as we had to alter our plans to accommodate a four hour delay of departure otherwise we always find the staff at the ports when checking in as well as on board extremely helpful and friendly we always enjoy our excellent meals on board and we look forward to our next journey having said that the premier lounge used to be better value for money as the drink making facilities no more hot chocolate milk unavailable in the coffee machine tend not to work through no fault of the attentive staff
not very correct for the lounge seat that i paid for i did not receive it yet i insisted for the return i had to threaten them with filing a police report he didnt want to give me the place i had reserved and for which i had the heel be careful this is a very disreputable company
boat was good food was awful dover was a shambles
good welcome from you both for us and our two dogs what we did miss was a drinking bowl for the dogs and perhaps a slightly larger space to walk around with the dogs
had a great crossing only the lounge chairs at seaside seating were less quiet than expected it was next to a fairly noisy kitchen and on the deck above i think there was a pool table where you could hear the balls falling into the hole every time a good restaurant and friendly staff
the trip was easy to book the staff at the port are friendly and professional the staff on the ship are exactly the same the ship was clean and the restaurant was good
traveling with children is somewhat challenging but when you also experience the less enthusiasm and stiffness of the staff you as a parent become tightheaded unheard of that there is no doctor on board people with food allergiesintolerances are little taken into account
everything went well checkin punctuality and friendly staff breakfast was also great i would definitely come back
first the positive the vast majority of the staff on board were incredibly nice and helpful but that didnt help much we experienced several unpleasant things that together make the trip quite boring our cabin smelled of diesel and when the car deck was directly below you could hear car alarms all night long incredibly tiring this must be sorted out in addition to the fact that it was very hot in the room but the crowning achievement was our dinner buffet experience we were placed at the end of a row and this was in the middle of the blade where people passed and we had a long table next to us with people those sitting closest to us were the children of course i was hit with bags by those who passed by and the commotion on the table next to me was intense the adults yelled from that end which made the situation worse then there was chaos around the buffet where everyone went in different directions and people gave you ugly looks if you came from the quotwrongquot side we tried to ask nicely for a new table as the waiter was too busy for us but no it was not possible even more tables by the windows were vacant maybe those with nicer cabins were reserved but you could have been informed about that in advance and for information water per person costs a staggering nok dinner is an incredibly important part of the experience and could make this trip much better unfortunately it meant i wont be back
hello the staff is top notch very friendly and helpful ok we only had normal cabins but the upper beds had no lights or lamps otherwise we are very satisfied best regards peter winkler
good information during the journey comfortable hut good food
the cooked food was very tasty but both were unfortunately lukewarm we could not understand any of the announcements as the sound quality was so poor all the soap dispensers in the gents and the ladies wife were empty on the plus side the staff were very polite and very helpful
good organization when boarding good service nice staff
flexible and quick checkin furnishings and seats a bit worn
the atmosphere on board is great beside the student groups doing running races in the corridors of the cabins until boarding is a little bit tricky one really feels the age of the boat also the cabins are like in the ths you can see the extensive use
nice staff fresh cooked food clean boat everything worked as it should first time customer would recommend
well organised on time friendly and helpful staff excellent dinner and breakfast buffet with wide choice sufficient entertainment comfortable beds economy hut shaky stairs to the bunk bed economy hut very small showertoilet room economy hut
charged twice for upgrade of cabin still waiting for refund on return journey shower head in cabin was filthy above and below bathroom mirror covered in rust three course meal scallops returned uncooked lamb fatty and had been heated up on grill so could only taste charcoal all in all not the best experience of dfds
efficient on time loading good food clean cabin all good
wifi was exceptionally slow and i was unable to work or even listen to the football unacceptable considering the cost exceptionally noisy in the cabin with noise from other cabins nowhere to buy something simple like a sandwich or burger set menus are a waste of time and money on this specific trip there were also a lot of big groups of children who were out of control running around bumping into people i would suggest you ensure this is better managed in future and they or their guardians are policed
i am so sorry to have to give a bad review but a good one is simply not possible with the nonexistent service bad behavior and poor food that my friend and i experienced last week the first evening we ate at seas lots of food to choose from but not delicious food got a vibe from dalle valle we ate our fill of meatballs from the childrens buffet and soft ice cream there were no more forks left so i asked a waiter for more another guest had done that together before me so there we stood and waited could see waiters out in the kitchen but no one came out with more forks after min i went into the kitchen and asked a rd waiter for forks he said quotarent there any over therequot and yes they did at another buffet in the evening we wanted a drink and went to the northern lights we sat down at a table and after minutes a waiter came and said that he had promised that table to some others there was no reservation sign on it therefore we were allowed to sit on the windowsill we ordered a coke and a strawberry flavored lemonade we got a coke and a passion fruit lemonade a little later the band a man on a piano and a singer started to play we sat right next to it a middleaged man from the bar unfortunately i must not mention his name went down to the band and they started arguing we only heard some of it and it was about them playing too loud and not playing according to their agreement the young singer left the room right after the middleaged man comes up to my friend and i when im talking on the phone note the band had stopped and there were no guests nearby he tells me in a very rude way that im not allowed to talk on the phone i immediately tells my brother on the phone that i will have to lie on the phone he says quotyes you willquot of course i lie on the phone and then i say quotgood eveningquot to the middleaged man he comes back and asks if we cant figure out how to conform to his rules we answer yes but leave it was really an unpleasant experience when we come out of the bar the poor singer is shaking and crying after the argument she had with the middleaged man in the bar my friend and i are speechless and ask if girls are okay and if she has anyone to talk to she says she has and we tell her that its not her but that middleaged man who has something wrong with him we decide to go down to reception and talk about our experience they listen and ask if we are okay i myself am very shaken and felt sick to my stomach to be in a place where as a guest you are treated badly but almost even worse to know that the staff are also treated badly we got drink tickets that we could use in the other bars and we were of course happy about that but i hope that the girl in the bar got the help and support she needed and possibly a fire note for him the middleaged man from the bar the next day we decide that we want to buy pizza at little italy we go there at to book a table you cant tell the lady at the counter that we will be back at to eat food we are told there are ahead of us so we now order pizza and get a quotbeepquot that beeps when the food is ready after an hour and it still hasnt beeped we go back to the restaurant and ask when our food is ready she says we are first in line to order we thought our food was ordered an hour ago we ask if we can eat in the restaurant to which the lady says that there are many in front of us we are quite confused and then ask if we can eat our food on one of the other tables on the boat to which she replies quotyou have to ask the others about thatquot then she asks quotwould you like to eat here at the restaurantquot and we answer yes because we had just asked if there was room for us and then she shows us to a table we are so confused a male waiter comes down to us and asks if we want to order at this point im ready to cry we answer that we were here at over an hour ago and ordered food there is no control over anything fortunately our two pizzas arrive after minutes nothing to shout about and certainly not worth kr we ask if we can have two glasses because we want to share a coke it is not possible but we must get two straws fortunately we are really good friends and we have really laughed and cried over this horrible experience to make the best of it we cannot in any way recommend others to go
missing a burger bar cinema and slot machines the staff are nice and nice but if you want to increase turnover introducereintroduce the things sincerely tina
the staff were very helpful and polite there was an issue with the cabin we had been given and after speaking at the service desk i was shown cabins to choose from plus a complimentary drink voucher thanks to all the staff for your cheery disposition and helpfulness just one negative though i was unfortunately very disappointed with the kennels for my dog these are more like cages no way would i pay for my dog to stay in there so i upgraded to a pet friendly cabin
sweet and helpful service good food
noisy in the dog cabin pee poo area could be improved by option to clean with e g water everything else was ok to good crew was very good everybody very friendly the ship s is a bit outdated and should be replaced anytime soon
well arranged we were able to catch a boat earlier both there and back breakfast on board also excellent
helpful staff lovely evening meal in bistro restaurant but the massive overcharge on bill was very odd chaotic breakfast in a grubby dark dining room with overcooked food long delays in disembarkation of vehicles was it helpful partly due to unmanned channels in border force tired washroom in cabin
well organized problemfree transfer from copenhagen central station the ship is well equipped the evening buffet was first class the cabin was small but functional everything was great
the cooked meal was very poor quality my pork dish was cold my wifes fish was cremated and both our chips must have been prepared the day before left a bad taste as this was the start of our holiday i failed to take this up with staff as i was so disappointed and didnt want this bad experience to mar our holiday also if the staff couldnt see that this was of bad quality then that raises an issue euros i wont be seeing again im a frequent user and i love our crossings
on time staff lovely boat clean cabin comfortable wish the coffee was nicer
excellent directions and service buffet and breakfast were fine cabin was clean and without issues
travel from kleipeda to kiel all good but cabins could use a makeover carpet so worn off that you actually dont want to touch it with your bare feet still stars because travel was smooth on time and food ok
i travel quite often on newhavendieppe and return this was from dieppe and it was a good crossing my only criticism being that the food in the cafeteria my fish and chips were not hot and looked tired as if theyd been cooked hours before i bought them as soon as i had boarded before the ship left the quay disappointing
clean ship friendly and helpful staff highly recommended for everyone
we made use of the premium lounge facilities very quiet clean and comfortable an improvement might be the option to order food as the provided snacks are very limited this could be at extra cost but away from school parties etc the provision of drinks was more than adequate i would also like to say we found the staff very friendly and helpful
the cabins are comfortable and the food is delicious the staff is friendly and nice it would be cool if they had a fitness room with treadmills
comfortable clean cabin friendly courteous staff thank you
consistant high quality staff food and ease at which we start our holidays always very friendly and helpful
super nice ship nice and clean a minus that would like to be improved you have to wait in line at the breakfast coffee machine for minutes
cabins are very clean staff very friendly
the group booking reservation was bad and difficult this time it is incomprehensible that the early booking discount is not valid for groups group of people bed in the hut was an improvement not yet optimal but slightly better mattress back again a bad mattress with springs coming through the bathroom is really getting old now and you wont notice that in the price meals were fine but its a pity that you had to pay for your drinks for dinner after barely hour at the table and actually had to make room for the next one as quickly as possible because it was busy while you also had to wait in a line for at least minutes for your food too bad this time
boat was on time both ways the boat was presented clean and tidy with good seating and pleasant staff
excellent crossing staff were helpful and attentive lunch menu was a little disappointing unlike dinner on outward trip a week earlier
checkin fantastic staff fantastic buffet seas once again top notch experience despite the fact that they make the same food week after week it is incredible that you can deliver such a poor food experience placement of guests traveling with a child of years i would think this was taken into account when assigning us a room a location updown from the exit to the pool area does not provide much peace during the dayevening its low
we travelled as foot passengers checking in was straight forward and staff were helpful i sampled the soup at midday but it was rather watery not recommended the announcements were not as clear as they might have been due to the system rather than the person making them as the weather was good on both journeys we enjoyed them
everything apart from the restaurant food was fine the cooked breakfast was cold poor quality and expensive
very friendly staff and an excellent band whats up the cabin was also neat and clean the buffet and breakfast were also excellent
good price punctual friendly staff food ok
the booking organisation was great and very helpful to change the booking all vehicle loading is very efficient and the resto is fine
efficient travel nice food friendly staff
we had been looking forward to a nice sailing trip departing on saturday afternoon as soon as we got on board we noticed many obviously intoxicated unpleasantly noisy and shouting fellow passengers on the aft deck the dinner in seven seas was ok from a culinary point of view but our conversation had unequal competition from a lousy playing and singing copycat band in the restaurant the worst part was the noise for a large part of the night from shouting and screaming drunk people in the corridor outside our commodore cabin where there was a fight with pillows and duvets it was not possible to talk it down there was calm at and we arrived dead tired in oslo dfds had a great responsibility for not intervening are drinking trips where you make the money
an excellent experience but food could be a bit more tasty
comfortable seating efficient loading and unloading clean
on time leaving and arrival good facilities plenty of comfortable seating and good choice of food
easy boarding and check in food good and overnight comfortable chairs
on the way back to ijmuiden it wasnt possible to sleep there was a lot of noise and vibration
loading was efficient food variety good and quality seating comfortable and toilets good terminal could do with refreshment area food on board wasnt hot and duty free was a bit sparse
it is very helpfull that in the morning at oclock they wake you but when you arrive the captain is saying something in just english and he speaks loud and soft together so you cant hear what he says so next time please all loud or nothing at all
staff attentive and professional condition of ship very clean and tidy facilties availability good but it was very quiet
everything is clear and easy to arrange good dining option i did miss a lunchroom
amazing first time on a ferry staff made you feel welcome drinks were good and food was amazing
the crew were helpful and polite and loaded and disembarked efficiently the ship clean comfortable and food had a good range from sandwiches soup to full meals we arrived early because of the distance we had to drive we could parkin newhaven but there was no indication of the reception being open once we investigated we found it was and toilets etc could be accessed but it was not clear when we arrived early in dieppe there was no access to toilets or parking and no information i know newhaven is a working port but on arrival back the ship comes in beside a very large rubbish collection area i presume for recycling but what a poor first impression for visitors arriving
very helpful staff food very good will use you again exceeded my expectations
seating was good although was very busy with noisy teenagers food was awful with meat fish choices and only one vegetarianwas vegan choice it was tagine with flatbread and poppadom and choice of veg rice or chips tagine was awful in taste was cold and position tiny compared to the meat choices of chicken or fish or pork which were huge chips were cold and flatbread and poppadom was unedible at best save your money get a better meal before or after the ferry ride
boat was on time staff were friendly and helpful the range of food and drinks was good
good boarding delicious buffet food cabin small but everything is there very good customer service geertjan thank you very much good shop super friendly staff on every deck extremely helpful in short thank you dfds
big compliment i can give a big compliment to the staff entertainment hygiene breakfast and the ongoing buffet dinner a blemish on all of this is that we are scheduled for dinner at pm much of the food was already gone and was not replenished while we also had to pay the full price shouldnt be
boarding with the motorbikes was very chaotic our group booking of was completely spread out during boarding with the result that it took minutes before we disembarked in new castle in the bus parking lot after the check some people stood with motorcycles between the trucks which doesnt feel nice
very satisfactory the ships were clean and the crew agreeable and helpful recommend more comfortable seating as there were no cabins available for the return night crossing
the sea was calm the was nice and clean the food prices was good
the food was poor quality the chicken pasta was cold and it was the same items every night and the fact you have to pay extra for your drinks and water the cleanliness in the cabins was appalling it was so dusty you could see it heaped up near the window etc the cabins need updating the air circulation hot and cold machine was broken and the water temperature doesnt get above luke warm for the prices you charge id expect more investment in the experience that customers receive
all employees were friendly the toilets were clean everything on time because i was early i was able to board a boat there and back earlier
the departure was punctual the meal and the staff were also kind
lets start with the negative the room do not book an inside double cabin unless you are under ft i expected a small room but not a broom closet no photos appear on their website it seems for good reason secondly with the room you either have to choose to have the ac on with the worlds loudest fan or no fan and its be super hot i also didnt expect to book a room where there is literal rust forming in the sink the positives the staff are all super the entertainment great prices on board arent that bad for a pint is ok food is an ok price for what you get but kind of expected this to be a bit high over all i would pay more to fly than catch an overnight dfds ferry again
very helpful staff excellent evening meal grossly overpriced wine new boats are needed the current ones are more than showing their age
we found it clean tidy everything was neatly arranged nice luxurious commodore room tip indicate that it is danish tv due to the distance between amsterdam and new castle you expect dutch or english channels the game room was not really inviting we had a yearold son with us which we thought was a shame
had the most wonderful mini cruise to oslo at the weekend the staff on board were super nice and provided a really good service especially those who were responsible for the entertainment for children deserve a huge high five and a hug the cabin was quite worn and could use a loving hand but thats pretty much the only thing i can put my finger on the food was also super delicious both at seas and little italy
on the trip out we had to move our seats twice once because of a cold draft from the aircon then again as we were getting headaches from the smell of paint thinners or similar chemicals this spread of paint fumes was quite widespread on one side of the ship coming back was fine with no chemical smells and no cold aircon
easy to book staff at reception desk helpful checking through gate was easy and girl very pleasant directions to board efficient easy to get cabin key and given directions to cabin girl on food check out needs to smile more chap in the morning pleasant cabin clean could do with extra sheets as gets a bit chilly crossing smooth disembarking good lady at passport check out in france a bit stern and not very welcoming maybe it was the early start overall good and would recommend
clean comfortable and good food on offer
the ferry was clean and on time the breakfast was horrible cold and unappealing not much choice for the price it was disgusting
usually good food was absolutely terrible otherwise good service
both sailings were on time the staff were very helpful and friendly and the bedroom was quiet clean and comfortable food choices were limited in both restaurants for gluten free but i got bread for breakfast when i asked for it the furnishings are a bit tired looking but overall very good and would definitely use it again
beautiful experience well organised tasty food and friendly staff
nice weather good food nice boat friendly staff
this was an enjoyable way to travel from copenhagen to oslo dinner and breakfast in the buffet restaurant were delicious and our inside cabin was economical and perfectly comfortable
fast and simply boarding tasty decently priced restaurant food clean and tidy shop overall just whats needed for the channel crossing
arriving early we were given an earlier saling also all your staff were very friendly only drawback the food could be improved veg was swimming in water served by ladle without holes and fish was too ready made off a shelf like chicken and chips were tasty
very friendly helpful crew neat sleeping cabins food was fantastic and very tasty both kitchens a la carte and explore kitchen in one word top
much better than we expected excellent dinner in the explorers kitchen dining room great choice and as good as any restaurant and probably better fantastic choice to suit any diet and breakfast was also excellent
i enjoyed the cruise itself but i had very bad service with the waiter at the dinner buffet who was very condescending for no reason i have never experienced such behavior i do not recommend taking the dinner buffet at dfds
we are quite happy with punctuality and our cabin we missed the availability of a proper breakfast also we would prefer to avail of a more comprehensive timetable
we were put on an earlier ferry than booked departure and arrival on time the meal offer is adequate with the breakfast being just warm enough the beef curry on the return journey was very good however
sailing on time unloading reasonably quick friendly crew food fairly good
after been seated for our evening meal no one came to ask if we would like a drink after minutes i stopped a waiter and asked if we could have a drink was told abruptly this is not my section i asked him if he could find the person who was serving our table he then left and no one returned we left the restaurant very thirsty having had no drinks it was pm and the restaurant was fairly quiet
thyme and lemon chicken meal was good the only negative was the cold drinks refrigerator not working unable to drink the tea bottle i had with my meal room temperature make it taste like medication
nice people clean and efficient ship food good and available at am everyone cheerful and helpful
overall it was fantastic a little disappointed with the evening entertainment in the columbus bar the queues in the coffee bar on deck seven in the morning of the th april were very long bought two croissants no preservatives were available thought this was very strange the service was very slow
lovely staff nice food and clean i personally think the times should be worked out a bit better as you dont actually get a day in amsterdam by the time you wait around and get transfers ect you get maybe hours
nice ferry friendly staff tempting hot food good roomy cabin with ensuite showerwc unfortunately long wait prior to boarding unfortunately smelly wastes in what is otherwise a nice showerwc cubicle quiet resting time in cabin unnecessarily shortened by late boarding and irrelevant announcements about eg shopping facilities etc on our nightcrossing
greater engine noise and vibration in the cabin on the outward cabin than would have expected such as it was difficult to sleep
friendly staff well organised it was the first time that we had travelled with bicycles and we were boarded as soon as we arrived buffet meal was reasonable great starters and salads but mains and puds were disappointing certainly better food holland to newcastle than going out although the same menu a problem with the cabin toilet door was quickly resolved with a prompt change of cabins all in all a good trip
it was on time and not at all crowded the staff were very polite the time passed quickly no complaints
efficient service and friendly staff comfortable seating e everywhere even the toilet areas were very clean the breakfast on our journey to france on the th was very good
all good food serviceferry nice and clean
very big difference between service and quality of the boats facilities pearl has tv in the cabins as standard which is not found on crown ordered the same dish pork chops at pearl weeks ago which we repeated at crown yesterday only half the portion here at the same price
well the food was very bad i thought it might have improve since last time witch was about years ago it hadnt getting onoff a nightmare very expensive for instance po restaurants pp yours restaurant put po far superior sorry but not a good experience
on our mini cruise to oslo we chose to have dinner in the explore restaurant and we have not regretted this we got great service from a waiter named farid and a girl whose name we dont remember they were both present and smiling we got the same good service on the trip home this time in steven seas restaurant also from farid the food in both places was great but the dishes in explore were a bit small
just got home from a fantastic trip to oslo overall the sailing trip both out and home was super satisfying friendly and sweet staff everywhere nice and clean cabin the area with the pool and hot tub could have been a little cleaner good evening buffet and also breakfast buffet however some of the dishes at the evening buffet were a little too greasy also really good pizza at the italian restaurant the biggest minus was that we would have taken the shuttle bus from copenhagen central station but due to a lack of signage and no one knowing anything we ended up spending nok on a taxi to the ferry
good food efficient and helpful staff but i always find the announcements hard to hear they are very clear in the aisles and cabins but not in most of the seating areas and never loud enough to combat the voices of loudly speaking passengers
my husband is in a wheelchair and boarding was made easy check in both ways was efficient we always use the restaurant for breakfastsadly by the time you queue behind people getting hot drinks the food is often cold yesterday i observed a staff member putting plate covers over the food of people in the queue whilst waiting to pay therefore you obviously know this is a problem could the drinks machine be relocated so its before the hot food counter kind regards barbara
boarding process very straightforward ship clean and comfortable only issue has been lack of plant milk for teas and coffees
quick turnaround at the ports and clean food areas
all ok but the inside deco with the food feels like s
on a weekend trip to oslo from frederikshavn ked dfds pearl my wife and i had chosen to spend the trip home in the lounge chairs however it turned out that there is an industrial kitchen immediately above the room we were sitting in when it was time for dinner it sounded as if a major renovation was going on up there so that eventually it became unbearable to be there despite the fact that we had turned up to full drone in our headset
we arrived a tiny bit late to check in but were allowed top join the short queue regardless to our great relief all check in people and crew members we encountered were friendly and the cabin was spotless the bathroom was clean the shower worked well the towels were big and soft the beds were comfortable and everyone had a decent reading light were vegetarians vegans and brought food with us which nobody objected to there are plenty of places in the lounges to stretch your legs or play games the crossing was smooth and uneventful the whole experience easy however although we think it is great that dogs can share a cabin instead of being locked up the allotted space for dogs on deck is really small and the tiny smelly sandpit for peeing and pooing horrible i appreciate that theres no room for a park with trees but a bit of turf and hedge would surely be possible
a good service cabins are clean and friendly staff please add more vegan options to the food menu
all was good until we had to queue up for a cup of coffee in the morning of our return trip
had a lovely time all the staff were friendly meals were lively it is expensive but you are allowed to take food on which is fab
on time comfortable journey good food nice staff good value
excellent quality and value for money buffet evening meal good service everywhere on board
very efficient check instaff friendly and helpfulship very tidy and cleangood choice of food available
great trip on the mini cruise cabins were clean and comfortable and plenty to do on the boat only downside was breakfast which wasnt very nice the bistro was lovely for evening meal however
as an old customer of a long time l would say it says it all great little route newhaven dieppe very good staff crew good restaurant good food what more can you say continue like that thank you one all
first mini cruise really enjoyed the experience the cabin ls and ship was clean and tidy throughout great facilities on board
helpful and friendly staff clean ship plentiful comfortable and attractive seating
for a single ticket amsterdam to newcastle with no option for flexible travel daylight robbery food is naff and everything is very very expensive on board such a shame when im trying to fly less rubbish
easy check in easy everything comfortable nice food and drink good value for money my kids loved their adventure
the food it is tasty every time the staff are very friendly and helpful every time we have a small delay because of traffic but they accept as in the ferryreally nice experience
your staff were always smiling always there to help and answer questions they are a credit to your company the evening and breakfast buffet are value for money offering a wide choice of excellently presented food thank you for making the beginning and conclusion of our holiday enjoyable
comadore deluxe not up to scratch mini bar in room very poor no choice in beer in lounge only brown ale no lager wine an champagne cheap and nasty no room service for snacks we have traveled mostly with comadore and this time was a real let down
simple and quick boarding with friendly employees
good organisation great staff all around food is excellent cabins are somewhat mediocre but that was expected its all very clean and well organized we felt very well taken care of only downside were drunken guest making a lot of noise later in the night
we booked for the buffet meal on first night and paid nearly and for what was on offer it was ridiculously over priced my daughter has a hand full of chips and a bread stick not a very great choice and to also have to pay for soft drink on top off the cost of buffet it was a rip off needless to say we didnt book buffet when coming back to newcastle the cost of internet was scandalous too on the morning we were leaving boat none of the toilets would flush either in room or public toilets overall not a happy customer and i will be sending email for some sort of refund for meals
excellent trip staff amazing helpful and cheerful food excel cabin well thought out but just the bed could have been two inches wider plus this is a fortnight later aimee from customer services actually replied to acknowledge my review respect dfds
buffet dinner was very good lots of choices staff were excellent on board ship check in process was very lengthy and disorganised there were queues and only working tellers there was a fourth teller but he wasnt involved in checking people in we queued for over an hour
a great experience our standard cabin was clean and comfortable breakfast was excellent our only regret was booking the dfds shuttle which proved a stressful mistake we ended up taking a taxi to the terminal and wishing wed done that in the first place but other than that we enjoyed it all very much
quick and easy check in and boarding we had paid for priority boarding nice food in restaurant plenty of places to sit nice in duty free shop too we did think the prices of the meals a bit expensive this time at almost
efficient service clean boat and cabins helpful friendly staff
the staff in your shop at dunkirk were extremely helpful and friendly shopping in the store is a pleasure thanks to these youngsters the food onboard however was an expensive mistake the beef curry did not have a single piece of meat in it and the fish and chips were tasteless and undercooked
our sailing left and arrived at the scheduled time there was a good selection of food options onboard at very reasonable prices plenty of seating areas around the boat so all in all a pleasant journey
ship was clean and didnt feel crowded cinema seats were very uncomfortable and rather overpriced cabin was comfortable clean and roomy it would be nice to have a little more choice of snacks on board in the coffee shop
boarding was quick and punctual everything was good really except two things there is too much piped musak so its hard to find peace and quiet also the coffee bar is understaffed in the morning and the queue interminable
the staff are lovely friendly and helpful the food selection is good however its the same every trip and isnt usually very hot but there is a microwave available to help reheat food the toilets have doors with no locks and are often without soap in the toilet dispensers
great experience on time and easy boarding very polite and helpful staff good choice of food would use them again
booking and boarding very simple but a little long to load carsetc hot food on board was not hot but luke warm had to use microwave staff were very friendly and helpful
staff were all amazing friendly and efficient meal in the bistro was the best meal ever
poor selection of food in restaurant cooked breakfast the only option on a sailing that was over lunchtime
cabin clean but small especially showerthe crew were so helpful and polite dinner breakfast such a vast choice and enjoyable
clean passenger areas very friendly staff outside area not very appealing and small upper deck not accessible
fantastic time arrived on board quickly managed to upgrade our cabin to a family cabin which had bunks and a sea view we all loved it staff are really friendly and helpful entertainment was good and we loved bingo didnt try food but i heard it was really nice will be booking again asap
comfortable seats and cabins staff pleasant and helpfulvery little to improve food good but not hot enoughannouncements in cabins are a nuisance when trying to sleep although obviously some are necessary but overall the most comfortable ferry crossing over the chanel
great crossing as always on time friendly staff good quality food
good information when booking easy to find terminals accommodation comfortable food very good staff excellent
plenty of facilities on board reasonably good breakfast if a little expensive
this trip was not going as well as hoped the cabin for adults and children was terribly worn we got a triple bunk bed which the children had trouble sleeping in claustrophobia it was also terribly expensive there and there were almost no games for the children to play about the rest of the boat was full of bars and a shop which i said had very high prices there was nothing for the children to do there the food there was also not that good and not worth the money we paid extra to get a cabin with a window but we couldnt see much other than a lifeboat covering the view and people walking by and looking in it was a very unpleasant experience i do not recommend this boat for families
yesterday march on the way home from oslo our toilet did not work we went up and told the reception who brought a man down to fix it the man couldnt do it and we didnt get the opportunity to get another room not very cozy with a toilet that cant flush when one of us was seasick
boat spotless staff attentive food and drink good
we have just returned home after a trip from copenhagenoslo where we had a commodore cabin the trip was a very positive experience with smiling staff pleasant sailing very clean and tidy on board great that everyone wears a uniform the restaurants were top notch
reliable comfortable i believe you pay your staff better than some companies not full marks because a no vegetarian food left when we wanted a meal b it took a full hour after wed docked to get off the boat and through passport control very off putting late at night
on time ferry all ok except breakfast very disappointing on this crossing tough bacon uncooked tomatoes and toast only toasted on one side very expensive at
nice breakfast served by charming waitresses in a comfortable restaurant overall a lovely journey with absolutely no hassles
great trip yet again but some things could be improved on like rooms not enough pillows but we sorted that no tv in room but apart from that was good also buffet dinner could have had different options as was too much greekitalian staff were all very helpful and security were all very busy making sure we were all safe overall a good experience with very little to complain about well done team
good service on time food is not good and it was cold in the boat
shitiest company ever do not make the mistake to sale with these bastartds all of the stuff is very rude made me lock my dog in the car when i specified that jn my ticket he is a guide dog and he is panicking if left alone even before sayiling i talked to a guard about the dog and he said that it will be fine and thay he informed the captain of my dogs presence on board when i went on board they kicked my dog out saying he can not be there offered to stay outside with him even to pay extra showed certificated and chips of him being a guide dog even then they declined my offer of staying outside again am saying shitiest company and stuff ever i will be sueing if my dog gets depressed or stressed by this situations po so much better even have their own pet lounge
poor and nontransparent conditions unfortunately we had to cancel our ijmuidennewcastle trip months in advance because we booked our trip early we received a discount but that means we dont get anything back if we cancel not even the costs for the meals x dinner breakfast that we booked thats madness isnt it its strange that booking early leads to worse conditions very disappointing
my yearold son sister and brother as well as myself were on the copenhagenoslo route from friday the th to sunday the th of march all in all we had a fantastic first hours however the cabin with the number was extremely cold we measured below degrees in the room even the corridors were more heated than the room we therefore contact the reception to have you look at the heating system in the cabin the person who arrived to inspect the system raised a hand to the inout ventilation turned the quotthermostatquot a bit and stated that quotits an old shotquot and then went on his way again we slept fully clothed the whole trip already on saturday evening my son started to show signs of fever which was also measured a body temperature of the day after our return all men are feverish with runny noses headaches and sometimes extreme discomfort in the body up to date as of dd dfds has refunded the full amount for the cabin it must be said that it is an awesome service thanks therefore the rating has also changed from star to stars
probably want to print stars but before i saw fantastic food and good conditions and even for cheap money
extremely expensive not much to experience there are a number of slot machines to sell it on the site as entertainment philippians staff who are unfriendly and uninterested when asked a question they look at each other and laugh at you in their own language and ignore you completely explore kitchen is the all you can eat restaurant pp poor quality little choice and tasteless cup the person cabin was dirty and smelly the shower was moldy and the sink was rusting and leaking tip take bath slippers with you when you shower stayed nights and times a clogged toilet that was then unclogged in the middle of the night without notice our year old son was wide awake no towels upon arrival now we brought our own towels we only received towels on the last day but we didnt even use them anymore this was our first time cruising conclusion never again dont be tempted by a cheap offer because you will lose double the value since you cannot consume your own consumption in public places anywhere this way you are forced to buy everything there ticket on board euros to spend with people
we are a family of who have just returned home after a super good trip with pearl seaways really good service and more than what you could expect big smiles from employees and they were competent to answer any questions we had it was both restaurants the dutyfree shop and the reception the only small minus was the cleaning in the pool area it could use an upgrade we will definitely come again
we have just come home from a minicruse to oslo the trip lived up to our expectations but still only got stars because the service in restaurant seven seas was not what we expected we got a table at and then at was the waiter came and said we had the table until which was incomprehensible as there were many free tables we had to hurry to throw the food in our mouths and did not get the cake and coffee that we had been looking forward to enjoying definitely not in order
traveled from oslo good boat the cabins lacked towels there was only one more person coffee closes early at pm so it was not possible to buy reasonable food and coffee we were going to buy pizza at an italian restaurant but they didnt have take away this time and the staff werent interested in showing customers to tables and serving at the restaurant dfds can be better
slow service in the restaurant the staff could not find out that the buffet had been booked in advance so the entire companys dinner was spent finding documentation for this in the cabins furthermore it was subsequently also not possible to be allowed to pay for drinks as we were not served in relation to payment of the bill all in all cannot be recommended in any way
nice ship but the staff are absolutely not service minded and they respond flabbily and several times we overhear the staff among them making fun of passengers and screwing them over we need new staff with a new attitude towards customers
we had bought a christmas trip with a christmas buffet it turned out to be so dorglie here is what i wrote to them they dont bother me now moreover you have a week to find a solution that can make us happy very disappointed with christmas trip christmas was ruined reply in thank you our christmas trip is so disappointed it doesnt live up to what it says in the lid first of all we were told it was a christmas buffet as you know we had small children with it should be quick to show that there were several problems with it we sat down to the table the first was a disdain that many people should not eat it made the people sad and difficult to watch quietly as they couldnt get anything to eat have to wait minutes while others eat there they came and asked what we want to drink i said a coke for me and children wife got wine but nothing came for children i had to share with them too long when the cotton swab was empty i asked for one more they hated it not then the next wheel came inside but only my wife and me the one son got food this time they forgot my daughter we asked several times we just have to wait until everyone got what i paid for it in the end we just got that we only now go up and fill up again there we others finished eating but son couldnt like the food he got very upset i tried to walk around to see if there was anything else he could get because you failed children to get something to eat inge help to get then rice salamander came that had cherry berry sauce poured on it there are many people who cant like it so my children didnt get anything no help from the waiter then my wife got angry and argued with another monday he came in with some noodles to try to help which were cold and not new what a christmas you have given us at a price of thrown away i hope you find a solution to what we have done on your trip i have made some recordings and photos as i will post online show in do not take it with a big responsibility will come on them
it was a very lovely experience everything on the boat was great and the vibe was good the restaurants was fine a little overpriced but its okey some off the staff on the other hand was a little bit rude all around the boat and the hygiene in the rooms was very very bad if i could rate the hygiene it would be a the pillows and duvet cases was old and not cleaned they were full off hair dust and redyellow marks probably from a girls period on my first night i started itching all over my body and got all kinds of redness my face cheeks got all red and itchy and i got a rash i definitely still come back though but i really hope they fix their hygiene and get some new clean mates who actually do their jobs i got some pictures which i cant upload
we have just returned home after a new years trip with crown seaways to oslo what a wonderful experience in the nice clean wellequipped cabins there was water chocolate and snacks to entertain the passengers before it got underway however dfdss greatest strength is their incredibly friendly and skilled employees who with sweet smiles ensure that everyone has a good time big praise to them and at least stars the new years food was super good and no expense was spared on the wine even though it was called ad libitum their evening buffet is also a chapter by itself there is delicious food for everyone vegetarians vegans and those of us who like good fish good meat and something for the sweet tooth can only be recommended mvh susanne wraae
they make sea france look good cheap for a reason
it was fine we just needed somewhere nice to sit and a view from a nearby window the other requirement was sufficient heat and that was ok too helen and mike shopland
terrible customer service must travel from frh but cannot book a cabin even though there are available cabins as they are reserved for customers from kbh same ship it makes no sense at all as long as there are available cabins it must be the customer who orders first who gets the cabin regardless of where you stand
on time easy boarding and departure friendly crew and clean and tidy on board
overall nice experience but food bloody expensive
staff were so great and incredibly friendly with the children they had a great time
duty free shop was closed no cava provided in the lounge i paid for people in the lounge bar outside the lounge also closed so i could not buy food or drinks
nice restaurants clean ship helpful staff had a dog friendly cabin on deck yr old arthritic labrador dog walkingtoilet area on deck he refused to climb the stairs at first would help if some doggy cabins could be at level ditto granny with rollator in the partycant climb stairs and lift doesnt go to and from level when ship sailingtook a bit of perseverance but eventually the reception staff agreed to let us use the lift apart from these mobility hiccups couldnt fault the boat or stafffirst rate and will definitely use again
staff and facilities great and the food in the explorer restaurant brilliant cabin was poor as there was no stuffing in the pillows and the mattress was worn out with the springs and wires protruding
fast efficient boarding and unloading breakfast not great but overall experience worth stars as cost very reasonable
really bad customer service and lousy booking system the booking system crashed several times during booking cannot reorder breakfast writes an email days before departure but does not get a reply on the ship they cannot order breakfast the only option is to stand in line then its also mindboggling to send out advertising so that you can order breakfast and avoid the queue when its not possible
had a commodore cabin very pleased with the cabin and extras i think it would be advantageous to have an additional option for food the current options are expensive for families
staff were brilliantfood good cabin clean
wonderful service and food
dear team we would like to say a big thank you checkin reception on board very friendly helpful accommodation cute clean maybe a little noisy although i put that down to people who think they can speak loudly food table allocation varied meals various salads soup pizza burgers vegetarian section hot dishes various breads various desserts soft ice cream waiters friendly funny quick also in the entertainment area singer band were really great everything went really well on the trip what made us a little nervous was the waiting slow progress until we were finally on the bus lack of calm on our part you never have time the staff were also very caring that no one fell down the stairs and wished us a great stay conclusion for us a successful break from everyday life with lovely people who made this break possible thank you very much
fraud and sham no stars from us do not order food from home which you are encouraged to do approx one week before departure we had given some friends a golden wedding present a mini cruise to oslo departing on december first one party falls ill and announces it on the friday before departure which is monday they call customer service and are told that a cancellation costs of the total price incl breakfast since they have not paid for the trip themselves the undersigned is contacted and i call in and get roughly the same answer but i do not think i have heard that ordering breakfast is also included but it is the friends then hope that they can be healthy before departure as there is a lot of money to lose but then the other person also gets sick corona and the trip has to be canceled for both of them i contact customer service and am told that the table captures of the total price cf the travel conditions you could probably have stated that it was better to cancel breakfast just to be safe good thing that by mistake we had only ordered breakfast one way if we have to sail with dfds another time it will probably be a while after this treatment we will in any case refrain from ordering food on board think if we get sick before departure otherwise you must remember to tell your friends that on top of the gift they must remember to take out travel insurance which must then be added to a wedding gift they thought was free greetings sven erik
excellent service staff very helpful and polite will definitely do again food absolutely amazing
just no problems ship was very cleaned the food was just great
sailing was on time crew pleasant food range good and has got better comfortable seating and quiet areas
very organised in all aspects of travel clean tidy and helpful staff
really enjoyed the crossing from copenhagen to oslo great rooms and spectacular views however the only let down was dinner we had a reservation for which was a prebooked buffet with the ticket all the food that was meant to be hot was cold and mostly inedible layout of the food was also very disjointed vegetables raw in salad rather than cooked got charged dkkpp for tap water would use again but wouldnt prepay for food
i gave you but the food was that good need to be updated
nice mini cruise the commodore cabins are worth upgrading as wifi and delicious breakfast are included great options for the children with entertainment the christmas buffet was of course expensive but the food was of high quality and really delicious however found a lot of dried blood on one of the duvets when the cover fell off now we had to leave so didnt have time to tell you but not so nice
easy process throughout booking at the ports on board all good experiences friendly staff who welcome passengers on board is something i never experienced with po clean ship good quality food great crew will be back next year
the crew was very friendly and helpful they helped me with all my luggage i stayed comfortably in a pet friendly cabin with my dog
excellent trip from ijmuiden newcastle food and drink selection was good all staff on board were fantastic super friendly we slept on deck people hut great size for adults motor was audiblepalpable but not disturbing cabins are noisy but not disturbing for us the disadvantage of the cabin was that it was quite warm even though the ventilation was on the coldest setting unfortunately i did not see much of the ship due to severe seasickness but the rest of the group had a good time plenty of activities live music bingo cinema highly recommended
clean and tidy but the staff were very friendly and helpful
we felt well looked after from arrival to departure all staff were pleasant and helpful
good crossing nice food
very clean boats good staff great all round
all good reasonable prices clean comfy accommodation bingo was rubbish though funny but rubbish
cabin was roomy and comfortable and the journey progressed very well however the bathroom facilities flooded when we used the shower in the morning due to the shower not draining this made the bathroom unusable and we had to use the public toilet facilities
the staff were friendly and polite the dinner buffet was outstanding the internet didnt work for most of the triip in spite of paying for the hour package the door key often didnt work meaning i had to go to reception and ask for help the bathroom had a lot of rust and discolouration needs more staff on for the coffee shop in the morning a half hour wait is too much
it was lovely to be meet and greet the staff as we borded the ship and lovely food at a good price well done dfds
nice seats for eating and also the comfort ones are excellent duty free was also great though could be a bit more on offer maybe as theres a world cup going on would have been nice if the teles while able to receive a signal had shown the games
staff always polite efficient and pleasant shame about the announcements throughout the night which stopped me getting any decent sleep i wish there were a cabin available as i chose to sleep on the floor in the loungebar area
after a problem with the car ramp we were unable to disembarkwe were kept informed free coffee and drinks and were offered a full meal before we disembarked great staff and so helpful and polite hope to travel again soon
we booked online to this day there is no indication that you can only book a dog in the car not in the cabin you have to call separately and ask about availability as i said this information is completely missing during the ordering process and is not at all visible ironically it is not even mentioned in the explicit information email quottraveling with petsquot so we were shocked when we arrived that we had to leave our dog in the car overnight we were also informed that you can only get to the car when accompanied by a member of staff and that you cannot get to the car at night when we tried to find a solution no one showed any willingness to make an effort and they sold us the socalled quotdog hotelquot as an incredibly attractive alternative this quothotelquot is a bright and extremely loud room that is cooled to what feels like degrees and in which the dogs are kept in dirty boxes dogs are generally tolerated rather than welcomed on board so they are not allowed anywhere except in the car the quotdog hotelquot the cabin if you can get one and the quotfreerunning areaquot this is a tiny fraction of an outside deck ironically right next to the windows to the restaurant where the dogs are supposed to do their business but hardly any dogs do that because there are only steel surfaces available it stinks and everything screams quotget outquot to encourage the desire to run away there are two benches one of which is broken and the other is very close to doing so finally there is a kind of litter box which was largely ignored by all the dogs there because of the smell in general most dogs seemed to prefer to endure hours without relieving themselves rather than giving in to it dogs are actually not allowed anywhere else the argument is quothygienequot with regard to the carpets thats funny because on the entire ship everyone walks around with dirty boots as well as children who scatter their snacks all over the floor during the race none of this is a problem it also doesnt seem possible to set up a larger freerunning area although almost nobody used the very spacious other outdoor areas it goes without saying that you are forced to go out with the dogs on a hour trip in all weathers and that there is no indoor area at all leaving the dog in the car costs per trip when i ask how this amount comes about no one will probably ever be able to give me a comprehensible reason as i have now found out a quotdogfriendlyquot cabin costs an additional this too is like many things here miles away from any kind of proportionality unfortunately the ship itself reacted to the problem in a very unhelpful or even unfriendly manner and a subsequent email to the service set up specifically for such purposes was simply ignored only the lady on the phone between the two trips apologized to us several times and also mentioned that complaints about exactly this problem are piling up i can only advise against using dfds with a pet and we will never set foot on one of their ferries again especially because of dfds quotproblem managementquot as of december after my first email to the service email address was ignored i followed the request here in the comment and tried a second time quotof coursequot without any response no words never again finally a rhetorical question to dfds why are there comments here or even a service email offered when it doesnt seem to be processed at all as of february out of the blue a response came and apart from the cost of the buffet and without us having to ask the entire price for the round trip was refunded also interesting and important is that since january animals are no longer allowed to be left alone in the car during the crossing by law
i took this trip instead of flying i thought it would be fun and spontaneous unfortunately i got seasick and had to take dramamine which makes me feel worn out when i decided to get out of bed and grab some food i went to one of the nicer restaurants i was seated by the hostess and shortly after nearly kicked out by a waiter the waiter told me i couldnt sit there and was convinced i snuck in when i told him the hostess sat me he didnt believe me and insisted i move he finally grabbed his manager to which i reiterated my story me i just want dinner i was seated and this man doesnt believe i belong here after some embarrassment the manager checked with the hostess and confirmed my story the manager apologized and served me for the rest of the night the problem is the initial waiter who questioned me never apologized and walked near me all night with quite an attitude that experience ruined my trip in the boat and made me feel less than pleasant for the rest of the short cruise
lovely boat we had king going and princess coming back coffe shop on board and a few bars to choose from has band other has solo singer they need to concider having a choice of quick food on board as some people dont want restaurant food
the stuff and sitting area are all clean and tidy thank you
i am diabetic and was hoping to get breakfast before docking but the cafeteria closed half an hour after leaving the uk h and all i could get was a drink also the duty free shop didnt open
very good checkin and better breakfast than last time but that may have been your other boat good crispy bacon otherwise everything smooth as usually
relax lounge wasnt available so booking clerk changed to premium lounge with no extra charge a pleasant surprise ship was clean and all staff pleasant
seats are not suitable for night travels not possible to sleep in a confortable seat
staff very pleasant comfortable journey we before bar food look forward to going again next year
an empty ship a rough weather crossing that he ship made smooth on time return efficient service easy to change to an earlier crossing only bad thing was choice of meals out at lunchtime just breakfast things
clean good food and no delay
ferru paldeski kapelskar is a old school ghost ship wit crapy food on restournat and needs to be off the line asap better order food small bar hopfuly its better then leftovers from yeaterday retournt for eur
staff on board was great however no play area for kids with actual things to keep them entertained just a mat
excellent service polite and reliable comfortable boat good food choices limited choice in duty free shop
nothing to eat for me as a vegan not even a hot coffee the men in the cabin next to mine were very loud
just been for a mini break to amsterdam with the wife booked room and food at same time good price for what we got check in was so quick once aboard all the staff was very helpful and polite we found our room and for couple of nights it served its purpose beds were so comfy with onsuite we had a mooch about before we set off and went for a starbucks coffee ive never liked starbucks but thought id try it yep still dont like it shame there in nowhere else that we knew of to get a coffee apart from restaurant which wasnt open be nice if there were coffee machines here and there we set off and got in the duty free well priced and good selection which was a bonus because we forgot a travel plug as there was no uk plugs sockets or any usb charge points in the room this would be a massive bonus if they did i had pre booked the ala carte for first night sat down and was asked for our drinks order food was prepaid but you have to buy your drinks for a bottle of water ouch the young girl who served us got a bit annoyed because she miss heard my wife asking for wine and lemonade when we mentioned this she got a bit mouthy towards her no five star because of this food was nice but not worth the price tag and then your drinks on top and unfortunate for me the coffee was from starbucks so i stuck with my water they had bingo on i n the main bar which was a laugh but you could have gone to cinema or casino if you wished we hit the hay and soon asleep but sound of the running of the ferry was pretty loud but ok breakfast was in the explorers kitchen which was a buffet with massive choice me being british good ole fashion english breakfast but when i went there was no beans no mushrooms fried eggs i dont think it was out yet as next time we went in it was all there anyway food wasnt to my liking so ended up stuffing my face full of fruit we disembarked and got on a couch into the town all part of the paid package amsterdam is a beautiful place but hours in not enough back on board hit the duty free again and then wend for food in the explorers kitchen again it was a buffet with loads of choice wish we had come here the night before as the food was fantastic and decent coffee brought to you in a jug again all drinks were seperate sat in the main bar area ordered drinks from the most miserable bloke ive ever met think he only had look on his face anyway there was a band on and they was great couple of hours in the bar and back to bed next morning up breakfast chill for abit and the back on uk soil straight through customs with no bag checks and home we deffo going back to amsterdam but for a week next time all in all dfds made a good impression on me and the mrs with most of the staff very helpful and friendly thank you
excellent facilities but food was not hot and chips left too long before serving excellent bar and duty free
due to weather conditions ferry was late and slow the curry was lovely
always perfect good and affordable meals confortable seats
on the whole it was a stress free way to travel from netherlands to the north of england with a car and onwards to scotland the checkin and boarding process was efficient and friendly we travelled on the princess seaways on both legs of our trip the staff onboard were in the main friendly very helpful and polite we had booked dinner in the north sea bistro for both legs of our trip the food was of great quality very well presented and delicious we had booked breakfast for our first leg because we had a long drive ahead but we were quite disappointed with the choice great if you fancy fried foods that have been sitting under a lamp for a period of time it wasnt so great for other options there was a little fresh fruit but not a lot of choice for healthy options i personally found it to be too busy and stressful first thing in the morning at am we had booked an inside cabin with bunks the cabins are as to be expected small but they were clean on both legs of our trip what we struggled with was the paperthin walls and being able to hear the slightest sounds from other cabins or the corridor and there were a lot of inconsiderate drunken passengers we did try to get another cabin but the dutch lady at the customer service desk was rather dutch direct euphemism for rude and seemed very annoyed by us asking if there were any commodore cabins to which we could upgrade and pay for of course this is why my review loses two stars one for the noise and the other for the lady on the customer service desk on the sailing from newcastle to amsterdam on th oct in summation if we could pay a reasonable price for cabins with good sound proofing we would definitely rebook emphasis on reasonable price
hi we went people from friday october to sunday october we book a table at seas on friday at until saturday at we arrive on time and have to say that we had reserved a table for friday ie at and get a long nose quotyou cant book a table in advancequot erm well you wrote it yourself on the paper we got a table well it was for friday well we asked for a table for saturday at so we stood there no buffet to get people we had to eat a sandwich from the coffee shop is it our fault no i certainly dont mean that when you yourself write that you can book a table from home so that statement surprises me a little on top of the hat of course it can be human error but the actual safety instructions in case of fire or similar which are announced over the loudspeaker came first on the way home from oslo has something gone completely wrong here normally we are very satisfied nothing at all but this time we were quite disappointed i know it was the end of the autumn holidays and many people but definitely not a good experience when there are of us and we want food is there something to quotfetchquot or is it just annoying etc the
the team in the office are very rude when talking to customers because we missed our return slot we had to go to the office for a ticket the lady who talks to us is not polite at all
discouraged from taking food onboard however the buffet food offered was of a low standard and coffee lounge items are ridiculously overpriced specifically euros for a can of soft drink
all went well staff in the premier lounge was very friendly booking was straightforward
unfortunately there are no snacks on the ship if you dont want to use a menu or the buffet the dutyfree prices are far beyond what you would expect from taxfree shipping
everything fine except food arrangements which were poor in comparison to the sister vessel
service snd general cleanliness of the ship
good value for money including cabins and food i would prefer to not have the announcements about the shop opening and closing in the cabin because this disturbs the sleep which is very important on a night crossing
the check in process and the cabin was very good indeed on the newcastle to ijmuiden ship the food was nice but why charge so much for soft drinks with dinner or not tell people they would have to pay extra not even free water available at dinner time sadly this is the sort of meanness thats remembered
we travelled with the victoria seaways and had a car with us boarding and directions went well however i saw men smoking below deck booking was straightforward low season now for the bad news the cabin was just disgusting the mattresses look like theyre from the soviet era things are broken or completely outdated everywhere i come from the hotel industry myself and can judge what a cleaned cabin should look like here it seems that only the bed linen had been changed that was it fingerprints everywhere people with high hygiene standards will not be happy here i personally avoided walking barefoot on the carpet the food was canteenstyle but ok german is not spoken on board
cleaning was fine and the food was good but the staff on the boat were very unprofessional and rude inge is in control of anything and is not interested in helping
everything very good and will use dfds every time would just like food to be a little better the fish and chips were very poor
food was average
offered an earlier train on time depot and arrival food and coffee was good enough
hrs sailed from newhaven all good but the onboard temperature was too warm for us difficult to cater for all on this one so only an observation
bad management with a broken gangway unfortunately the checkout in amsterdam was catastrophic the gangway was broken and on october th we were penned in like cattle and waited for an hour to leave the ship via the car ramp thats probably why i got corona despite wearing a mask a precautionary plan is absolutely necessary for such an extraordinary situation otherwise the outward and return journey went smoothly the staff were very friendly the cabin was clean and inviting and there was a varied breakfast a mey
excellent service as usualexcept for a long wait in the restaurant queue due to several coach parties leading to hundreds of people before us in the queue
pretty good all round seats in the tv area are a bit tired now and not too good to get a nap in food was tasty and hot goodon time too
outward bound to dunkirk no negative issues staff were very helpful and friendly food not bad had to wait outside dunkirk port due to departure of liquid natural gas cargo under supervision return journey not up to same standard all cars and lorries on same deck and loaded late blue stairways stopped at level and could not go beyond without exiting outside and moving to red stairways no help from staff food awful with driedvery fish but catering staff apologised and were extremely helpful and friendly in resolving food issues
we had a safe and pleasant journey but we upgraded to the premium lounge and ended up going down to the main cabin for the views and the additional space it was our own fault and next time we will forego the upgrade
this boat was worn out the prices there are laughable glutenfree hahaha yes it was a joke paid almost nok in a buffet for two adults and a child to eat the sour potatoes there plus they should have money for a glass of soft drink up on the price of the buffet no seriously they could have had it all inclusive as they have such high prices the water park shit dirty and disgusting the entertainment for children in the autumn holidays yes it could be like you let it be a big joke sad people who worked there no this boat totally disappointed us
decent trip copenhagen oslo could have been more activities on board such as casino games more selection of food and clothes their small rooms are not good socket plug in the whole room for people does not hold ok selection on tv but should have been sockets by the beds as i said no be afraid to inspire yourselves by other companies the internet on board is too expensive nice staff on board with good help
very friedly and helpful staffcomadore cabin was ideal for our family with free wifi and breakfast included
just went this weekend and there were many positive things apart from important ones had i known that it was impossible to get veganplantbased food i would have either refused the trip or brought food with me you couldnt even buy bananas so i was hungry the whole stay in case of emergency a waitress from the italian restaurant got a vegan burger but it cost and tasted terrible no vegetables in it just fake meat and lots of cream it made me sick to my stomach a tip for you is that vegans do not want fake meat but vegetables it is not difficult to cook food without animals and without cows milk it would be nice if there were a few vegan dishes in every restaurant based on vegetables and not on substitute products slept miserably in the eveningnight and could not rest in the afternoon either due to very loud irrelevant loudspeaker announcements constantly inside the cabin it should only take place outside the cabin where it can easily be heard from was on the th floor
food in explorer restaurant superb as alwaysstaff good as usualsea very rough on return voyage and captain should have kept speed down to ease the ship motion dfds should also ask amstedam council for bus shelter at the new transfer pick up area
the boat was clean and tidy but the interior felt dated and in need of renovation the food and drink prices were also extortionate each for a buffet meal with very limited choice with no drink included not even water getting on and off the boat took forever and the port staff treat everyone very differently when dealing with staff some were friendly and others particularly the lady at the entrance to the buffet hall couldnt have been less bothered about us overall im not very impressed at all well take the eurotunnel next time
we were on a minicruise copenhagen oslo in august everything worked satisfactorily right from checkin in copenhagen the cabin corresponding to what was ordered the preordered course dinner in the ia la carta restaurant lived up to expectations just as the pizza on the return journey was also delicious polite service both in restaurants and bar the only small minus was the lack of changing towels during the stay in oslo
as usual a nice sailing and on time gripe is the food no option for vegetarians except soup or a plate of chips at an extortionate price and the limited vegetables are always mixed carrots and peas which obviously come out of a tin no choice of carbohydrates except rice or chips also the cost of main courses has increased by over the past years i will still travel with dfds next year
nice clean modern ship and helpful crew premier lounge could be better equipped though
there was a very poor choice of food available on our crossing as the snack bar was not open and the lighthouse cafe had only two sandwiches noone seemed to be willing to help and we had to ask for plates in all other respects the crossing was satisfactory
on our outward journey the cabin was very noisy and stuffy and i believe that the standard of the buffet is not as good as in the past on the return leg the cabin was much quieter and cooler and we opted for the north sea bistro for dinner which was excellent as usual on both journeys the staff were attentive friendly and efficient
its always a pleasure to use this company its efficient and reliable courtesy of the staff is great only small regret please change the restaurant menu and start feeding us with proper continental food forget curry or fishchips give us a nice lasagna ratatouillepork schnitzelchipsanything will do better than curry or what ever that bean thing is its revolting just to look at it thank you
bad buffet with lukewarm food that is overcooked or dried out here we are talking about their seafood buffet that you can make such a bad basic pasta dish is an achievement in itself the breakfast in the commodore lounge was nothing to brag about either the bread was dry and the staff rather rude and didnt really care the commodore room was outstanding the entertainment in the columbus club was fun not the wild singing talent all in all i will not take a trip like this again way too expensive for what you get
a mixed picture on board the staff were helpful and the buffet was wideranging and delicious however the online booking experience was appalling as a consequence we lost our booking thrice during the process and finished up paying more than the original cost for a totally inappropriate and uncomfortable cabin i intend to explain our unfortunate experience prominently on social media unless some compensatory gesture is forthcoming
when choosing a cabin from the website and looking at the picture the cabin looked fine however after viewed the cabin on ship it was nothing like the image on the webpage just one point to consider is when you choose to upgrade your cabin on the website and have chosen another cabin when you come to checkout you are charged for two cabins obviously you only need one so you have to backtrack on your order to remove the first cabin poor web design the cabin on deck was noisy right by an engine difficult to sleep and the cabin felt old dated and only had one plug socket the cabin reminded me of the s when all cabins looked this way however we are in s and the cabin fell way below todays standard but was classed as an upgrade we asked to change it but the alternative was the same cabin but without a window and even smaller very poor to make things worse the colleague behind the desk referred to it as that cabin in other words you dont get much with that price however it was classed as an upgrade poor both meals were very good and the choice was excellent and good quality even if we did need to play hunt the spoon please bear in mind that no drinks hot or cold were available you had to buy them entertainment was soso with the highlight of the evening being bingo we had to return back to port after two hours because of a medical emergency but we just about caught that up so a big congrats to the captain shop ok with plenty of stock and with and a sale on clothes and also a few on drinks i have travelled to the continent for over years so i feel my comment should have some weight andrew
very helpful crew good facilities generally and quite good value for money larger duty free and less expensive cabins would have deserved stars
good service nice hot dinner even at am better value than p and o
boat was dirty in toilets chairs looked horrible full of stains floor was dirty
checkin in klaipeda takes place via counters in the port before boarding a security officer checks the boarding pass boarding pass of the car the new ships aura seaways and luna seaways have been operating on the route since cars are parked on the upper car decks decks so that the walk to the passenger areas is not that far all passenger facilities are very modern and bright and there is plenty of space on board there is a buffet restaurant dinner amp breakfast and an la carte restaurant dinner there is also a bar and a caf that offer small snacks amp drinks as well as a shop the cabins are very bright and clean the lithuanian crew was friendly and helpful at all times
the whole experience was good very efficient loading and unloading breakfast was good at a reasonable price the return was a delayed by customs but again loading and unloading was very efficient the evening meal was ok and reasonably priced good all round experience
clean and efficient reasonable food
i have booked a ticket including family meal ticket in february but when it came up to the date of me boarding on they said that it was during covid restrictions but wasnt stated in the ticket when booked very disappointed
excellent service and enjoyable crossing i ate in the cafe on board and had half a chicken and chips it was cooked perfectly overall a very good experience would definitely cross with them again
we found the ferry clean the staff friendly and the food excellent had a lovely beef curry and rice well done
i had already complained that animals were not allowed on deck unfortunately it was not possible to cancel our booking a disappointing experience all round
very relaxing voyage the meal service and choice of dishes was excellent the crew were friendly and the ship was very cosy certainly if budget permits this route dieppe newhaven is our first choice thank you
long queues to get through the check in booth might not be their fault we has the buffet evening meal and it was poor quality for the pice paid the breakfast was also of a poor quality on our return leg we upgraded to the bistro restaurant and paid the difference we had a bottle of still water and they charged p robbers at sea the actual meal was superb come on dfds set reasonable charges and you may get decent reviews
small cabins if you have claustrophobia you should not sail with fdfs as an allergy sufferer the staff at reception laugh at you when you react to the cleaning agent on the boat and in general the staff at the reception are incredibly flabby and not very customer friendly they dont want to give their guests a headache pill when youre suffering and their guards reprimand you when you walk quietly around the boat after midnight in the context of the little italy restaurant which was a disastrously miserable dining experience the trip with dfds was not worth traveling with we will take the car next time to oslo
unfortunately i cant say anything good the bathroom still had the old towels from the previous guest and the carpet was full of crumbs the wastepaper basket was full and the mirror was covered in fingerprints we were very disappointed that we had to clean the boat ourselves for a lot of money and we wont be booking this ferry again
used this company for the first time and both crossings were a pleasant experience on time with good choices of food and drinks on board i would however recommend that a there is a designated smoking area on board outside on the deck as it was not pleasant to inhale smoke for our children thanks to all the staff
the breakfast offered on the outward voyage on was awful the bacon was dry and cold the egg overcooked and cold the mushrooms just cold the toast also cold and rubbery all that for the price o about plus was a great let down after an early drive to get to the ferry however i was pleased to be put on earlier ferry for the return journey
well organised very clean cabin pleasant staff
i advise against ordering dinner or breakfast in advance as this cannot be opted out again even if you contact dfds more than hours before the start of the journey money out the window
this time as never before it was poor experience we start travel later than what we has been told also the food at restaurant was really bad then ever before the fish wasnt been fresh it means bad smelling
on time and exactly as expected on board food is always good
starting with the good points checkin was efficient and the staff were pleasant loading was very organised and once on board we found seats where we would spend the night both our outbound and inbound trips were on the night crossing the boat departed on time on on both crossings we were disappointed that the lights in the seating areas couldnt be dimmed down to allow for some rest they were kept fully bright even when the bar etc had been shut this was the same on the return but with added noise form the staff who seemed to ignore the fact that people were trying to rest also on the inbound leg the male toilets on two decks were out of order and the one toilet that was working had a broken seat it would have been nice if there could be a dedicated quiet dark area for passengers to attempt to sleep
everything worked like clockwork with the ferry however cooked food very expensive and barely warm certainly wont be buying any again actually no different from my previous review pre covid
an excellent journey for the kids the food in the restaurant was amazing
all great just wished they done an all day breakfast instead of dried up fish and chips or a so called curry
we arrived early on the way out and they accommodated us we arrived late on the way home and they accommodated us can not fault them
the way we were treated by the french border security was unacceptable and disgusting
this was our fourth time on the minitrip from kbenhavn to oslo and back first trip on high season and by far the most traumatic for us adults kids and a toddler first i would like to thank all the breakfast staff who by all means tried to destroy our breakfast by blaming my mom for trespassing when she was first in line at am to hold a table for the rest of us next to the oslo fjord view her only sin was that she didnt have her door card with her after my mom insisted on not to go back to people queue and entered the breakfast room to find a table our table was monitored on the amount of food we as a family had on our table and being pushed to leave the table while other tables didnt if you are a foreigner expect to be treated differently as other families didnt get the same treatment at the end the staff closed the curtains for the only reason we went on this sail and the reason my mom flew km the breakfast buffet lacked fruits croissant and decent buns the buffet had one vegetable a day note if you booked rooms in your order the system books you automatically upon arrival and dont expect to get close rooms its the fourth travel and we never had rooms next to each other and no matter how far you keep your phone from the key card as youve been told the key card will stop working at the most inconvenient moment and you will have to drag yourself to th floor and wait in line to replace it the worst part was when i asked customer service representative on our way to oslo if we should clear our rooms when we leave the ship and have been told it is not necessary just to come back to an empty room and discover that the cleaning staff packed our stuff and left us without a room and book our second room so far from each other that they were on both ends of the ship and we needed to pay kr for the upgrade no compensation have been offered or given and the overall feeling is that we are just a problem needed to be solved and we should be thankful we are on the ship
difficulty in sleeping on night crossings need a distraction no food counter
we had an absolutely brilliant trip down to copenhagen in the commodore cabin with free access to drinks and snacks in a cabin on the boat named crown i was a bit put off on the return trip with the boat pearl that we had to enjoy this only in the lounge and could not bring this in the cabin as it seemed like we were doing something criminal to just bring a coffee cup from the lounge when you pay to get a cabin with a balcony so it is expected that you can bring drinks and snacks into the cabin this was very disappointing but the cabin and balcony were big and lovely and we enjoyed the crossing nice and clean
comodor cabin the breakfast itself and checkin in kbh ok we are a couple with grown children and traveling to be together being placed in the middle of families with children for both evening coffee and breakfast both days could have made our experiences much better can it be managed in the future chaos on boarding in oslo and on disembarkation could perhaps be reduced with more open counters getting the escalator fixed that hasnt worked on recent trips or similar i miss general information in the cabin about opening times etc and a direct number for reception
great experience overall food is somewhat overpriced i think everything else was excellent
very efficient boarding and polite and helpful kiosk staff deck crew very polite restaurant staff appear very demoralised and extremely unhappy in their work they were very polite and efficient ship was clean and tidy i will use you again
it seems like a relaxed way to travel but it is actually suffering and being squeezed out the already very high prices actually include surprisingly little the rooms are very small if person is standing the other cannot go anywhere the air circulation is really insufficient which means that the stale air upon arrival becomes much worse as the journey progresses both in the sleeping quarters themselves and the corridors leading to them there is only english socket per cabin which is very practical for people wifi pay per hour for just mb maximum oh yeah and the range doesnt reach the room food and drink pay drinks you bring with you may only be consumed in the sleeping quarters there isnt even room for that products purchased in the onboard shop may also not be consumed on the seats or in the corridors you will even be sent away unfriendly the only option is to use a very mediocre buffet excl drinks at high prices or an even more expensive restaurant the drinks in the bars or clubs are also significantly more expensive than normal entertainment on board is disappointing just watching a movie is casino and game room are quite disappointing these are a handful of vending machines that you will also find in the pub sky bar is just the deck with the counter of a pool snack bar but without the fries and double the price no decoration or appearance at all the whole thing gives the impression of wanting to be a kind of cruise ship but that only works in terms of price the public places are still somewhat decorated but the deck is no nicer than a fishing boat and the rooms are in the style of an emergency building or construction site a striking detail a mirrored rear wall without partitions near the urinals may be chic on a gay cruise but on this boat it is really inappropriate save yourself a lot of time money annoyance and help the environment by just taking any other form of transportation hours from ijmuiden thats not amsterdam to newcastle on board this boat is just really tough this company is only concerned with making as much money as possible from their passengers
even though the ship is empty you are still sent to the lowest deck despite having children aged you have to wait an extra hours friends or acquaintances of the ships staff always get a seat upstairs and unfortunately this is not the first time we have seen this
we went from wednesday to friday last week we ordered a commendor class it was really a different experience than the others we have tried on both your ships between copenhagen and oslo we got two small wine and chocolates and water was also there and small soaps in the bathroom it was luxury and both breakfast and the evening buffet were both good so we would like to come again
good service high standards of cleanliness efficient and so forth food pretty poor at the price but serving staff couldnt be more pleasant
we were very pleased with the service between newhaven and dieppe friendly efficient and according to schedule there were just a couple of little things such as the reading lamps not working in the cabin and only one charge point the walls are very thin between cabins too
brilliant no problems at all easy booking in and loading on board food was good and service quick will use again
journey out very good food has improved tremendously the crew were friendly and helpful journey back okay but we had to wait a long time in the garage before disembarking minutes the air wasnt good and it was claustrophobic
dieppenewhaven a pleasant journey except for the lack of ventilation or air conditioning on a hot day was this due to covid or fuel saving or breakdown staying on deck for three hours was not attractive
booked the danskebten with outside standard cabin dinner and breakfast for travel by car to southern europe onboarding and offboarding was quick and efficient the cabin was clean quiet and had a good temperature even though it was c outside the only downside was that the cabin only had one socket we had chosen a course dinner the selection of dishes was narrow on the return we were offered a wider selection for a surcharge we were very satisfied with the service and what we had ordered but with the surcharge for wine and water it was a relatively expensive dinner the breakfast was better with a large and delicious selection the taxfree prices on board are high but the selection of certain things such as whiskey or sports shirts is interesting and other things such as wine or clothes in general are boring during the journey to kbh there were few places to sit without loud live music on the return trip it was quieter and the quality of the live music better all in all the experience was good even if some things were not ok such as eg a cancellation insurance that only applies to illness not clearly stated on the website rebooking fees and high prices for most things on board especially mobile and wifi as there are far more affordable ways to travel south it will only be stars but for those who want to save miles by car each way the danskebten is a good alternative
the captain last night on the sunday pm crossing was exceptional he was so helpful and guided us to the restaurant ahead of the many students to help us get the meal in time thanks so much we loved our trip and time dj lee dagger bimbo jones
wonderful trip a ususual a point deduction for inacceptable coffee prices
normally the service is fine and good value however for this trip for dinner the meatballs were tasteless and inedible in addition when we arrived at newhaven it took minutes to leave the ship though luckily the border control queue was only another minutes
had a night mini cruise to amsterdam excellent boat with great helpful staff food was not brilliant but it was better than nothing bit of advise tho to anyone going to amsterdam dont believe the signs in the shops stating cannabis cookies was legal to take back to your own country they will get taken off you when boarding the ship as they check your bags
had to wait more than hours in newcastle on the tarmac to embark onboard personnel was as usual cold clinical and disinterested no free wifi in contrast with po decent breakfast good cabin but very small shower stars
on the way to dieppe from newhaven we had a rather rude barman when i asked for a black coffee with some cold water on top he was loud and said that he couldnt do it and rolled his eyes his attitude was so wrong quite unacceptable to treat a customer in such a way on the way back we had to wait mins in the car on the top deck near a very noisy turbine to disembark supposedly at pm we never had to wait so long in our previous trips overall we are very disappointed with the level of service
everything was great clean cabin friendly staff tasty food thank you very much for your support you are the best
boarding process delayed and confused cabin small but as expected prices onboard are frankly appalling for a can of pop or small bottle of water is in no way acceptable food offering in explorer kitchen is similar to the very worst all inclusive wont be returning when a flight is less expensive
would have been stars as boarding was fine food acceptable good crew members in all departments all facilities were clean where we felt let down was depite being one the first lines to board in dieppe we were the last to disembark almost hour after the first to disembark due to waiting for large lorries to be off loaded
when i booked my trip from newcastle to amsterdam and picking my cabin there were two options for economy class these were economy and economy noise may occur i deliberately chose the one without noise on arrival at check in i was given a cabin on deck which seemed fine until we left the port and the noise from the engines in the cabin was unbearable after speaking to the staff on board at the reception they did their best to try and find me another cabin the offer to upgrade the cabin to one on deck was given for the fee of i agreed to this and the new cabin was perfect on return from amsterdam days later on check in i was assigned a cabin on deck after asking at check in if anything could be done to move me to a higher deck this was done without any issues a cabin was found for me on deck again id like to thank your staff for being so accommodating and helpful but id suggest you are more clear on exactly how bad the noise is in economy class on your website as currently your description is not accurate
biggest rip off company i have ever known very rude staff at calais ticket office will never travel with the low lifes again disgusting food onboard curry was served cold orange juice was warm steer clear of this company
clean modern ship with excellent facilities comfortable cabin
would have been stars if it wasnt for a minute delay on the way out due to a special manoeuvre not very busy quite smooth and the decent breakfast is back
we traveled between newhaven and dieppe on the albatre and seven sisters out on the and returning on theth june pleasant crossing professional staff helpful and courteous security and safety was maintained throughout plenty of detailed information over the tannoy system but could have been louder all staff where smart representing a professional appearance on behalf of dfds the food has improved over the years and with both crossings there was a good and well laid out selection seating was fine improved seating on the main deck only issue on the return was that the quiet rooms where closed off
the ship is a bit old all in all it is solid the cabin is clean the toilet smelled a bit unfortunately both the journey up and down take a lot of time that is very annoying mostly truckers on the kleipeda kiel route
it would be very helpful if the television was on the rest rooms to give something to look at
only one deck opened really noisy all the time slow wifi and food in restaurant didnt look fresh
food is very poor rude security guard the smoking area i think should be the same for everyone not the workers smoking wherever they want
noisy very young children in the lounge did not help a quiet relaxed trip after a very long drive
efficient and well priced crossing food options onboard are very limited but fine for the short crossing
efficient and very friendly crew cabin was reasonably priced and clean the shower was perfect after a week camping in france definite star rating
booked the premium lounge unfortunately unfriendly staff floor dirty had to ask for sparkling wine as no service for minutes after leaving port had to ask for food to be filled up as there were a dozen people coffee machine was beeping constantly and couldnt handle drinks in a row hot water repeatedly took to minutes to end up in the mug i regret paying money for this
very unfriendly crew especially the male ones despite the quotdogs allowedquot sign they are not welcome
we were very satisfied everything was on time and quick the crew was always friendly the interior cabin was clean and quiet delicious breakfast buffet with good cold cuts and good cheese very good orange juice crispy bread rolls nice live music on deck
food just for cash but i paid for the ticket euro
easter holiday with the family on the oslo boat was below expectations in almost all areas check in we arrived early and got checked in we were lucky that our cabin was ready but many others were only ready at so a lot of people were standing in the corridors the cabins for the first time we had booked a cabin where there were two rooms with a door between them so the children had a cabin and we had one it was wonderful with each of our cabins however one suggestion could be that there could be a small double bed in the parents cabin we were lucky to have to sleep up on deck but unfortunately it was extremely noisy so much so that we could hear when the neighbor flushed in their toilet the door to the hallway was really leaky and air and light came through the door all the way around the edge it also meant that you could clearly hear other peoples conversations in the hallway the toilets in the room did not work one you had to press times for it to flush out and the other had stopped and could therefore not be used at all there were towels in total which meant that there was no one to dry hands on after washing hands honestly i dont feel like drying my hands in my bath towel that ive been drying my bottom in my pillow was a fiber pillow that was completely worn out and there were large zero men on my sheet and small black hairs in the middle of the night there was a wakeup call when the ship ran into frederikshavn on one way there was a loudspeaker that in the middle of the night started talking about safety rules on board first in danish and then in english it is therefore extremely stressful to be woken up in this way on the way back there was an announcement again this time in the hallway but it was very loud in our cabin that the ship will arrive in frederikshavn in half an hour it arrived at again at at at night a message came that a quotkarinaquot and another passenger should go to deck it may well be that someone can sleep through it but for me it totally ruins my nights sleep food im sad that you can no longer book a table at sj which made really delicious gourmet food on the way out we tried little italy and on the way home the explorer steakhouse little italy was an ok restaurant with expensive prices dkk for a pizza with almost no filling and i think it was a shame that you cant book a table could see a lot of people queuing especially on the way home we saw a queue with maybe people in it i also dont think its that nice that its a glass cage where others stand and stare at you while you eat i saw that all the people who stood in line just stood and looked at the diners and stood with their heads between the glass panes explorer steakhouse the food was nice but expensive dkk for a burger menu i think thats really a lot for a burger and fries the childrens menu consisted primarily of deepfried food and bowls of cheap vegetables such as peas and carrots and then two large ice blocks with chocolate and vanilla ice cream on the other hand it only cost about dkk i myself got a halibut and it was ok but nothing special the fish had also been given too long several times the waiter came and asked if we should pay when are you finishedwe have to use the table and thats even though wed only been sitting there for a little over an hour breakfast we ate breakfast both ways but would probably recommend going down to the coffee barcaf instead of the buffet food there are eggs scrambled eggs bread juice and coffee etc but the coffee is really black and bitter my softboiled eggs had had too little both days so the egg white had not set and the bread was completely white without any substance the juice is the very cheap juice so nothing freshly squeezed here at a price of dkk per adult each way i think the quality is too low wish you could just have a small breakfast where the quality was good service on board in general the staff on board were friendly it seemed like they were a little understaffed though the girls who did the horse racing in the evening were also on never seen it go so wildly the children were happy with the childrens card with drinks ice cream etc on so it was a hit i also think that the staff in the border shop were friendly and for example helped one find the right size shoe for my daughter oslo we arrived in oslo on time approx at but stood in line approx min to be able to enter it is a very long time when you have to be back before pm for us this meant that we had to head back to the boat already at pm previously you could be in oslo until when the ship sailed and was able to see a little more we had a great time as a family on the trip but overall i think its expensive compared to what you get in the end
queue for hours food is just about suitable for a prison canteen the outbound crossing the meal was free with a voucher upon returning to the uk they were charging for a plate of dried up chicken and cold rice worth paying the extra to use the euro tunnel also maybe they can look into using the money from selling old food to employ a cleaner the toilets are absolutely disgusting
i really have to promise that have just returned from a trip from oslocopenhagen with quotpearlquot if only you had known in advance that the underlying noise came from the wildest technorave party from the columbus lounge had we probably chosen to upgrade our cabin rather than grabbing an overnight stay in an economy cabin with an accompanying description that noise may occur because if it is normal that there is to be a techno party until at night in the columbus lounge on deck could it be that one should add a text on the cabins that there is guaranteed to be loud thundering bass rhythms until late at night and if this is a single standing case private party then this is the only point where your customer service has completely failed thanks for l night lucky we were on our way home from holiday and not on the way out on the outing with quotcrownquot where we were also in the economy cabin only engine noise could be heard at night even though the boat was overcrowded with pax as you were reminded every minutes during the breakfast buffet please make room for other passengersguests when the meal is over goodbye and thank you we take the car for the hours and km the motorway between the two capitals in the future
poor wifi no contactless payment methods expensive and low quality food boarding and disembarking processes are smooth
a rare good service experience the entire ships staff were smiling and welcoming
hello dfds we were on a trip from sunday to tuesday we ate the buffet both ways when we got home the whole family was sick vomiting and had diarrhoea my yearold daughter and yearold son were very bad and we had only eaten at the buffet the whole trip
we were on a mini cruise we bought expensive drinks in the shop that were not refrigerated and when we asked for ice cream at the bar we got a no really bad service
terrible money machine we have sailed to norway many times now they are creating the base wifi costs money and if you mistakenly jump on their mobile network you will be ruined everything around the restaurants is terrible the queue system cleaning service the price and quality of the food it is almost impressive that you can make such a bad pizza for example and take dkk paper thin but soft and squishy completely tasteless in the small bite edge that was crispy in some cases pieces of industrial chicken and a hideous chili sauce on it top worse pizza ive had terrible service the employees are wandering around without serving the customers if the restaurants were located in any city they would close within months the slot machines were broken the selection in the store boring and expensive no corona restrictions mr and mrs horsens and their children roll around on the boat without distance or thought there is an ok little bar that plays music from years ago you avoid a long drive thats probably the only positive thing i can find about this trip
just had the pleasure of being served by lauge from customer service and what a wonderful experience i had a gift card that needed to be used and had to additionally order extra seats for the family and upgrades for everyone i ring and lauge tells me that it is true that his colleague takes care of gift card orders but that he can do it for me now that he has me he found everything and we talked about which trip we want to book since the technique is a little teasing he asks if its ok for him to hang up and call me back when the booking is ready so that i dont have to hang up just want to add that i didnt mind because he understood being present even if the technique was teasing i never felt left in silence said yes and he then hung up minutes later i get a call again and everything is clear we talk about corona restrictions on the ship and in norway i for extra information about the restaurants and ordered food on the departure as well everything was handled super professionally by him and it was a pleasure to be a part of he was really committed and just wonderful to order from big kudos to him and customer service
suite booked toilet still in it floor full of hair really disgusting no service that was the last time
i went with my daughter and upgraded my room to a commodore class room with balcony this was a very luxury trip at a reasonable price with good choice of restaurants and bars and friendly staff there is also different activities for children of all ages the view to the fjords from the ship is also worth the experience
the worst food board ever i took dfds ship calais to dover on wed in my ticket was inclued food i ate the food after h i start vomiting and have fever i went to the hospital because i kept vomiting and i felt a lot of pain i will never eat anything from the dfds again worst experience in the world
our family has just returned home after a well organized birthday without me having to lift a finger via booking i got professional help from philliphannah and they were always ready to help when i came up with more during the party dinner the waiter jeanette in blue riband was very sweet and helpful when we made requests and the wine had to be topped up the only minus on the trip was that i had to show my booking to the staff twice to document that i had paid for drink coupons and drinking on the return journey during the meal but all in all a really good trip and several of our guests will use you for their upcoming parties
i have been travelling kiel klaipda kiel for years today on the athena back to kiel such unfriendly staff today at pm and also yesterday evening that is impossible not even the famous lithuanian beer was available everything was ok for breakfast its just a shame that they didnt bring the presents but maybe a lot of people will read it andreas eschenburg
my sister and i with our children were on one of your mini cruises and we had a party but i have a few comments i think there is a lack of places where you can sit without having to buy anything the few places there are were always busy hours is not really enough to be able to walk around oslo im told it used to be and hours is there a reason it changed i also have a question for the shop i have been trying to find out which clothing brands you have i found a knitted jogging set and i cant remember what the brand was etc ida
bland food and not suitable for romantic get away girlfriend trip with crown seaways i have worked in restaurants for more than years and i have to say that dfds needs to improve on the quality of the food and facilities for adults when they sell it as a romantic get away the trip is extended on board and there is not much to do for couples without children boring food all the way through very boring food both at little italy steak house and buffet and coffee house the staff are extremely friendly but it is simply some of the worst food i have tasted there is nothing for adults to do all day other than sit and drink the swimming pool which they describe as wellness there are two small swimming pools full of screaming children the wine bar is completely empty and no music the buffet is boring and not cozy at all you could make a little better food it should be possible and you could put some music on so you dont hear the terrible sound of service entertainment also boring ssmme entertainment days in a row practice the coffee shop is also expensive and dry breakfast the beds were fine and you slept well but honestly you could do a little better with the food you cant get baranaise with your steak either which is totally grotesque the fries are soft and bland i hope that they make the trip a little more adult or make small cozy corners for adults when you have to spend so many hours on board also getting better food would have really pleased me as i love food but that you can make such boring food selections is a mystery to me kind regards camilla would definitely not recommend this tour for adults
i have tried to call and have emailed no response what the f are you doing we thought you were in business to have customers who on earth is the boss of this circus i wonder if a course in customer handling should be granted to the person miserable
we also ate in the steakhouse and unfortunately both ordered ribeye steaks we asked for steaks cooked medium and in particular the steak my wife got was so raw that we had to let it go back to the kitchen when the second steak arrived on the table it was exactly as raw as the first she therefore did not eat very much of it potatoes had gotten too much in the micro wave oven the sauce was thin and tasted of nothing vegetablesgarnishes were also not cooked enough the service on the other hand was fine they did what they could but a chef who cant fry a steak isnt a real chef all in all a really bad experience for approx kroner
now sitting in the worlds saddest commodore de luxe cabin worn dark and unkempt really wondering what were actually paying for tried a little trip in the commodore lounge which was neither pleasant nor relaxing again worn premises and a clientele who were probably most interested in free alcohol however the beds are good and tasty food is served by pleasant waiters it is the only thing that pulls up this crossing from copenhagen to oslo
just returned from a return journey dunkerquedoverdunkerque no complaints at all staff very polite and helpful free breakfast and lunch with a drink very welcoming would definitely use them again
if i could give stars it would have been in its place what a great experience just went on a mini cruise we have done that several times we booked a table at steak house when we arrived the table we had booked was taken and we were therefore directed to another we ordered asparagus with shrimps for starter it tasted great but then it stoppedour waiter was a very insecure young girl as mentioned we ordered asparagus with shrimps for starter for main course ribeye we waited a very long time and after approx an hour later the main course camei took the first bite the meat was very dry and suddenly it dawned on me that it wasnt ribeye at all my husband agreed and we called a waiter i told him we can agree that this is not ribeye which of course he could confirm the restaurant offered to make what we had originally ordered my husband asked because we had waited forever before how long would it take the answer was max minuteswhen most of half an hour had passed and the food was still not served we asked for the billwe got it not so much as an apology or any kind of compensationstop we were are disappointed its the worst service weve ever experienced ewsteakhouse on oslobden cannot be recommended the worst thing was that there was almost no one else in the restaurant
overpriced poor quality food poor security take a short break elsewhere
the food dfds served on board was a terrible i would be embarrassed and the hygiene in the mens bathroom putrid and not to mention your lack of staff
zero customer service i book a triprt copenhagenoslo and at the same time order a buffet in their seas restaurant when i get on board it turns out that they dont have the buffet at all and i am directed to another restaurant this happens both on the outward and return journey now just weeks after my first trip im going on another minicruise with them and again i have preordered the buffet but to make sure they really have the buffet so that i am not directed to the same alternative restaurant again with the same dishes and the same food rd and th time but when you call them and enter my booking number they just say we dont have time call again at another time what do you picture in it takes you seconds to take money from my credit card and when i want to make sure that i actually get what i pay for you dont bother to expedite me
the food for vegetarian people is terrible we paid more for that ticket because included food and we got chips rice and those frozen veggies peas with carrots whole the others have kind of options of meat terrible no food for vegetarian paying the same
poor customer handling service via telephone one can understand that they might be very busy because of lot of calls but the way the staff talked as awful he was speaking as if he is still sleeping did not want to provide even general information and showed a rude behavior such staffs should be fired immediately
i called to make a booking with pet friendly cabin for my daughter and her dog travelling from amsterdam to newcastle i spoke to samantha on the customer services team she was extremely pleasant helpful efficient and reassuring she answered all my questions and the whole process was quick and easy thank you
went on a trip with my son july it is not recommended to go on a boat trip with restrictions everything was closed pools disco etc so there was nothing else to do but eat drink you probably have to play games or download movies from home the internet is not strong enough to handle movie downloads the stay in oslo was ultrashort in the past you had half a day now they have shown hours but because we arrived late the time was reduced to just under hours we reached the town entered a shop shopped quickly and also bought some food in a hurry which we had to take with us it was stressful and not at all pleasant the dinner one day was good the other day was lukewarm ie ok the breakfast was terrible and there was no option to buy anything other than the breakfast buffet bread cold meats and tinned fruit and industrial eggs plus pastries were the buffet there was also yogurt which is good but when you pay the full buffet price its not worth it the coffee bar doesnt open until later so you cant just buy a bun and a cup of coffee the service on board was top notch the service via email does not exist when i booked and bought the trip there was an option to enter your matas card so that you can get points for your matasshop but i have never received any points i even wrote to them a few weeks later in august but got a standardized email reply that it was busy and they would get back to me then approached me again a few months after times the last time was in february the trip was made in july and the first time i wrote to their customer service the email they have written you can contact was in august but i have not yet heard from them ie half a year after
two people in one cabin no consideration is given to highrisk patients
lunch has become more expensive with long boarding and disembarking cars
timely departure clean bathrooms hygiene standards good food vouchers good coffee lots of seating nice outside deck partially covered with tables in the rear of the vessel problems with online booking but friendly customer service minimal waiting time
a mini cruise on the baltic sea very friendly staff the catering on board offers good quality at moderate prices
my second review of dfds which will be more glowing than the first my last trip from north shields to ijmuiden was in october under restricted conditions and in spite of the constant reminders to wear a face covering i found it to be a very pleasant trip this was undoubtedly and in part because of the low passenger numbers onboard around a tenth of ships capacity the ship felt a bit like the marie celeste at times but i enjoyed the ambience at the time of travel onboard mask wearing was requested and strongly recommended but not mandatory as always i prebooked my evening meal and breakfast which were served in the restaurant on deck the evening meal was very fine and served at table breakfast was ok but a bit limited and provided on a buffet basis coffee will be brought to your table one suggestion i would like make to dfds is to do something about the breakfast scrambled egg its really awful and quite inedible restaurant and shop staff onboard are now entirely asian philipino i think and are without exception pleasant friendly and helpful cabins are the same as ever slightly the worse for wear in places but currently more pleasant places to be than previously due to the decreased passenger numbers which means a whole lot less noise and drunkenness on board i no longer have a pressing need to travel but i hope to be able to travel onboard with dfds again next year if circumstances allow its quite expensive especially if you travel with a vehicle but nonetheless highly recommended as a very pleasant and worthwhile experience if you have the time beats flying any day
room below cleaning standard do they now it is corona going on bought the most expensive cabin commodore deluxe no soap or any other common cleaning aids in bathroom minibar was not refreshed either we noticed the reception immediately and went to the lounge area they told us to fix it at once two hours later we got back to the room nothing done i also noticed that the rooms table was dirty from last customer again the front desk said they would take actions we wanted to relax in room but hat to wait for cleaning once more i asked about a new room and at last we got a new room why should we need to ask for this in the sink of the new room we found black hair last customer everything else was ok we did not complain about this but where are your customer service where are your cleaning standard
this trip felt a little strange due to corona far fewer passengers than normal cabin and public areas were tidy staff quite as usual polite and friendly almost to a fault every single one that i talked to very punctual well done
we had some problems with booking travel especially the part with gift cards and departure day we got different explanations when we called and several different prices all in all after countless conversations and discussions things were settled as first agreed due to corona not everything worked as usual the messages and information also fluctuated depending on who was spoken to both by telephone at boarding and on board nevertheless we experience a fantastic atmosphere good mood and irresistible service we tried the christmas table on the way over which was not a great success it was all beautifully arranged and presented beyond all expectations however i could have thought that the pork roast was not fried dry with a slightly burnt taste it seemed as if it had been quotlight friedquot which does nothing good for the roast rice la menden did not seem to be homemade which disappointed us a little on the trip home we try again at explorers steak house here we got tartar fried monkfish and ribeye white chocolate mousse and apple pie it was beyond expectation super delicious juicy and cooked to perfection definite recommendation from here little italy which was the only place you could have lunch must be said to be a mediocre experience compared to the price but overall what you can expect in any case it had not been the first choice next to the other restaurants the price was simply too high in relation to the quality you got the bar as always the bar is a cozy place to come and the bartender did everything in his power to make the stay unique which succeeded thoroughly professional and wonderful service huge kudos to b the breakfast there were no fingers to put on super super delicious we didnt eat at the buffet as we had breakfast with us in the commodore but definitely worth recommending all in all a good experience and something we will definitely do again when this corona hallj is over
all in all a good trip with a cabin but no toilet paper in the wc thinking with the few people passing on board it must be possible to pray everything else was good good food on board with live music which was good
thats all right the food is also deliciously prepared in the kitchen
great crossing from amsterdam to newcastle modern cabins great entertainment delicious food and comfortable loungers on deck
good service good food good value
everything is far too expensive breakfast and children family of a disgrace lunch even more expensive
officiant good crew service nice food clean and comfortable seating areas
booking is easy and straightforward site works very well i always use newhaven dieppe as it suits my needs only bug i have is that the air vents constantly push out cool air in the reclining seat areas so its always quite chilly otherwise i cant fault the company service
crew very friendly cleanliness on board average but every rd passenger did not wear a mask on board and no crew member there to make the passengers aware
very clean ship with a variety of fresh food on board really enjoyed
it was a pleasant travel with a delicious meal i would recommend everyone to book dfds all workers were very friendly
the requirement to wear masks on board was not enforced a disgrace many passengers were without masks and some of the staff were too completely incomprehensible
seamless services very clean food and drinks are excellent too
very satisfied guests despite this vocis time when you have to wear masks in all common areas we had a super relaxing trip and i have to praise the staff on the whole boat they have kept the mood up serviced to stars we have not lacked anything there are not many guests including at the moment which i dont understand everything is top notch plenty of goods on the shelves and in the shop good food in the restaurant great entertainment in the bar and the option of upgrading to a nice luxury cabin if you want everything is top notch if you want to be pampered please danny thomsen nss security
under the current circumstances very smooth checkin boarding and sailing the buf bourguignon in the restaurant was particularly good
the experience was good as usualthe only bad thing is the price being double than previous years with the same amount of money i could buy a flight ticket or travel with travelling companies the positive thing it was the meal voucher included thanks
still the most cost effective way to get to northern france fair price reasonable food seating areas starting to look a little tired and not the most comfortable but adequate normally pretty boring tv shows on the monitors very handy cash convertor machines and shopthe service always seems on time which is good for forward planning will always try to use if travelling via northern france
everything was perfect food hygiene
staff at port extremely pleasant when booked in also staff on board very helpful when checking on dog on the car deck all in all a very pleasant trip

highest rating went gothenburgkiel took a more expensive cabin with panoramic windows friendly and professional staff throughout the boat in the restaurant and bar and also on floor where we stayed the buffet was top class incredibly affordable and good food excellent range of cold and hot dishes desserts and cheese tray the cabin was well cleaned and the bathroom was great the empty shower was good the breakfast the next morning was like any hotel breakfast great the only minus was when we had to drive off in kiel it took about an hour before we could drive away from kiel but that is probably more to blame on the traffic in kiel and not so much on stena line will definitely ride the kiel ferry again
web booking page a complete shambles to book on this site it simply the worst booking site there is crashes errors no pet addition button but states you must book your pet in off all the booking sites this is the worst ive ever encountered awful
stenaline harwich to the hoek of holland charge to much post covid it has got even more expensive whist quality cut backs in restaurants in particular also the stena lounge have been implemented in small stages the breakfast offerings have gone from good down in the same manor to very poor indeed until there is a competition on this route they will continue to exploit us
i am a driver and after a long time i travelled with stena mecklenburgvorpommern the meal voucher is only valid for the evening and the cashier at breakfast was very rude in pointing out that i could only pay with a card if there are such rules they should be presented in a more friendly manner double occupancy is not acceptable being crammed into such a small cabin with a complete stranger is an imposition and should only be done voluntarily
premiere lounge am no labels or allergy information on smooths or yoghurt with granola breakfast euros egg was cold and snotty bacon hard anaemic potatoes like rubber beans dried on the plate tomato was cooked then blow torch for colour fell apart whilst trying to pickup an eat it am no info on any of the cakes or humus looks like carrots celery in it one cake has walnuts no label ive near been anywhere with no info on anything very poor looks like truffs rolled in nuts on as well been a chef for years and labelling on anything very poor this day and age i would give it one star this needs sort asp as some my die from bad management or poorly trained staff
stenaline kielgothenburg really wellprepared gourmet food in the restaurant served by friendly staff we are equally satisfied on the trip with the buffet selection can really recommend stena lines eva and jrgen menus
honestly sickened horrified and shocked at stenaline forcing passengers to park with huge truck loads of baby cows crying out in fear pain stress my van was parked right next to them and as a vegetarian it was extremely stressful and i feel a violation of my basic rights this is disgusting that they are transporting live distressed animals who are defecating with the stress the smell the sound of them crying out absolutely horrendous i will not be using stenaline ever again this was my first time with them but my th crossing in europe and never ever have i witnessed something like this shocked and truly saddened
massive disappointment very poor service the stena plus lounge was used by stena staff to work conduct staff meetings not a peaceful relaxing area any longer luggage storage left unlocked anything could have been stolen nobody cared stena hadnt even noticed until i informed them hours after departure often nobody in service area i had to hunt staff down to serve me drinks general lazy uninterested level of service always pointing you to ask someone else
both on outward and return liverpoolbelfast booked superior cabin to be able to have drinks of tea during the journeys unfortunately both ways there was only coffee making machine took a long walk to guest services and they sent a crew member with kettles and tea bags shame one as to do this if a tea drinker restaurant prices a bit on the high side all staff throughout the boat very helpfull
we went from cairnryan to belfast return what an amazing experience great food upgrades for seating cabins and spa great shop with great quality and well priced products if you have sea sickness or any ear imbalance take anti sea sickness tablets before you sail or upgrade to the recliner seats
the staff were very helpful from the start good instructions were given right from the start with the truck very friendly welcome at reception very good dinner with a good selection breakfast was very good for me kitchen staff very friendly im looking forward to the next time
stena plus lounge on nordica is although clean and bright has the most uncomfortable seating imaginable only soup and sandwiches available at a cost and no water available to drink only fizzy cans of minerals regular traveller but dont think we will use plus anymore
we booked a trip from rostock to trelleborg simply because we didnt want to quotdrivequot as much apart from a few seats there were no options to make yourself comfortable for these hours we first satlay in the hallway and at some point we came up with the idea of bringing chairs from the deck into the interior to rest on not to mention the shop small unfriendly staff and no choice i could still complain about a lot toilets for example result never again
went stena from fishguard to rosslare and return paid extra for stena plus lounge well what can we say supposed to get a choice of comfortable seating complimentary drinks snacks and newspapers a dedicated waiter service and much more seating was hard and uncomfortable not the greatest of food selection some biscuits two types of cakes one breakfast cereal tea and coffee and soft drinks and wine saw very little waiter service not sure what the much more was return trip was cancelled by stena and we were redirected to irish ferries nice seats good spread of food and drink and friendly and attentive waiters will never use stena again very poor irish ferries will have my business from now on
we have taken the ferry to sweden for our summer holidays more than times in the past years and the evening buffet on board was always a small highlight of the trip this year the quality and selection of the food was at the lowest canteen level there used to be countless varieties of pickled herring and salmon but now there was only one type of each the classics such as kttbullar and janssons frestelse were also missing instead there was dry falafel and rice the dessert was very chocolateheavy even though the drinks are included the priceperformance ratio is no longer right here we found the lack of spatial separation from the entertainment area very disturbing
upon travelling today we used deck for food and beverages hospitality was excellent and exemplary very impressed with the customer service and how assertive and polite all staff were special thanks to johnny who took the time to make us feel welcome on board very impressed with the cleanliness of stenaline overall highly recommended and we will use the service again regards from satisfied customers
the service is getting worse and worse at the lift a member of staff reprimanded us for no reason and was so rude the bedding in the cabin is borderline and im not even talking about the food in the trucker lounge the coffee is disgusting we wouldnt travel on the stena privately but as we are truckers we have no other choice
we went to our sons wedding in newcastle northern ireland the trip over took about hours from liverpool birkenhead the staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble we had a cabin for the outbound and inbound journey we had a tv and bunks in case we needed to have a nap shower and toilet very clean and comfortable we couldnt have asked for better service john barbara
we travel annually on stena harwich to hook holland over the last few years there has been a dramatic drop in quality of basically everything the cleanliness of the cabins are pretty dire from sticky carpets to grubby walls and bathrooms in the cabins they no longer supply you with a paper cup or any cup of any kind after asking at a coffee counter the girl there slipped me a paper coffee cup even though she wasnt suppose to this is ridiculous the boarding staff are often rude and rather agressive if we could find a better way to drive to denmark from the uk we we would never use stena again ever prices go up on everything and the service and accommodation is worse than any rundown holiday camp you could imagine
stena vision cherbourgrosslare the positive everything was clean and the condition of the ship was ok but the food is very expensive doesnt taste particularly good and so i dont want to criticize the small portions particularly unpleasant the air and heat in the cabins could not be regulated it was extremely stuffy disastrous handling we have now been in rosslare for almost an hour and nothing is happening on the car deck really annoying i can recommend the stena horizon on the same route it has a nice wellcoordinated crew i will not book stena vision again
good morning just arrived in rostock we wouldnt book the stena line again its very dirty everywhere our cabin was so dirty it was just disgusting for that much money you can at least expect the cabins with bathrooms to be clean it was also very loud cabin and you could hardly sleep and that was after a hour car journey
hi staff very helpful menu a good choice of meals a comfortable crossing would gladly recommend it to friends and family would definitely book another trip to visit family in belfast thankyou
i want to specifically write about the pet lounge and the way stena line is charging customers quid without giving any additional service than what they were already giving we took our dog from cairn ryan to belfast paid for the pet lounge the policy states that they need to be inside the carrier at all times this is absolutely not needed as its a closed space with us needing access to get in and only dog owners can enter the lounge if i had to keep my dog in a cage for over hours i would rather have kept him in the car i would understand if dogs are not allowed on the furniture but keeping them locked up all the times seems unfair even after paying additional fee for the pet lounge my dog started feeling uneasy and didnt want to stay in the carrier and we removed him and they came and told us to put him back in even after requesting one of the employees and the employee agreeing to us keeping our dog outside the carrier another attendant came and told us to put him inside the carrier again again there is absolutely no reason for this as its an enclosed space and can accommodate more than dogs outside the carrier do better stena line
we went by boat from travemnde to latvia for the first time we usually go to sweden and finland we were positively surprised staff service cabin and food were top notch thank you very much
i have travelled on this boat twice the staff are friendly the entertainment programme is amusing if you have previously spent two weeks in sweden with no other social contacts but on the other hand it is almost unbearable the food is perhaps ok if you like pureed fish or the same on every trip but otherwise you will not find anything for children the cabins are ok please do not spend time with five people in one cabin getting any sleep is impossible apart from the really uncomfortable beds without back pain you can forget about that at least in the family cabins a really very exhausting travel experience and you do not have to make an announcement every two minutes that there are snacks on floor believe me once is enough the internet is also crap
on our return journey the choice of vegetarian sandwiches was virtually non existent we just wanted a cheese or cheese and salad sandwich each but this was not available also i was not able to understand the english spoken by one of the members of staff i feel the service in general was unprofessional which is a pity
the food is overpriced thats when you can actually get served i stood for minutes before forgetting it and there was on people waiting the lounge you charge euros each way for a comfy seat but if you cant read theres no point watching the telly dont really know what the euros was for as it rubbish and cold
we are just finishing a very pleasant crossing it was clean and comfortable on board and we were surprised by a really nice hot meal which wasnt bad value the staff deserve thanks as they were kind and very helpful
great confusion about places if you have not booked you will be thrown out of the animal zone if you do not have any animals with you even if no one has animals with you on the trip generally poor service
great value easy booking simple boarding clean and modern ship with lots to do on board good food friendly and helpful staff really very impressed
in short staff in the shop were unfriendly food was catastrophic cabin was extremely loud vibrations and engine humming including air conditioning only the checkin in kiel and also in glteborg was quick
customer service is very poor even with out permission he open my cabin door telling me leve the cabin i think staff need more training
simply an outrage cabins small stuffy loud beds are hard and narrow shower in the bathroom cannot be used i specifically took a bed room for people and at some point in the night we ran out of air so we had to use the very loud ventilation again i dont want to imagine what it was like for others breakfast was absolutely disgusting the quotscrambled eggquot in block form sums it up pretty well staff very unfriendly and the ship is in an extremely bad condition i felt sick from the moment i stood in front of the ship and it got worse every second
we like the stenaline because they have armchairs that you can sit comfortably on unfortunately this year on september st and th we were so cold that we had to leave the room even though we had paid for the armchairs this is the coldest room on the ferry and there is a constant draft we were happy with everything else
i often travel with stenaline and am happy i can bring my dog omboard but why is it that big groups of young people without dogs always settle the same place i cant move away from my spot bc it is a pet area and they are noisy and not respectful this means three hours bad trip i wish i could move around then i could also go to the restroom and get some food etc
we traveled on the scandinavia from kiel to gothenburg and back the ship is not in the best condition breakfast is not recommended we had reserved an a la carte meal for dinner its just a ripoff you only reserve one table the rooms are soso if you find a few hairs in the bathroom you know how it has been cleaned the staff are here and there depending on what they feel like at the time with the checkin with cars and trucks i have no idea what system they use it took agesyou can take a nap in between we paid for the return trip whether thats justifiedhmmquestionablethe only and last time for us
stena line best company we always go to kiel gothenburg and book the pool cabin we cant complain
birkenhead to belfast dont come aboard hungry the foods absolutely terrible tastes like it was cooked days ago and kept under lights
the dining area on board has a canteen feel but with high prices the entire lounge area is poor and not customerfriendly significant delay
worst company going birkenhead port not cleaned ships are terrible stena managers bullies
stena horizon food is horrible and so are some of the staff eastern europeans hope im never on the horizon again
after went back to the car left us sitting in the car for more than half an hour the food is horrible and found hair on my food not recommend to anyone
sailed from belfast to liverpool on the overnight i asked when checking in if their where any cabins and advised no it was suggested to purchase x tickets for the hygge lounge as they are comfy reclining chairs in a quiet room i paid for seats in hygge upon arriving i was extremely disappointed the chairs do not recline they are fixed in a very uncomfortable semireclined position you get free tea and coffee but for each for a pair its a complete rip off to make matters worse upon departing they announced that there are several cabins that could be booked for so i could have had a comfortable bed and shower for an extra rather than a horrendous chair and coffee do not upgrade to hygge there are plenty of seats and benches in communal areas that you can sleep on i asked at guest services can i just pay the difference to upgrade to the cabin and this was declined horrendous experience and complete rip off
seats are almost only available in the restaurant or for an additional charge of course you can also sit on the floor its only about hours i find it more comfortable in the car
we traveled on the britannica and were very impressed everything was clean and worked then we traveled on the european the toilets were locked and the air conditioning was turned up full blast everywhere both were very unpleasant
unhelpful staff poorly thought out pet policy should have a set area for pet cabins and pet walking area instead of randomly placed throughout the ship not pet friendly at all very expensive for extremely basic facilities did not even any teacoffee making facilities in cabin
i would like to thank the reception managers on board who kept us well informed and allowed us to use berths initially reserved but ultimately not used by their bookersall with the kindness of the stena agents the onboard catering service is very satisfactory
we arrived at cairnryan port for the am boat to be told there was a delay boat leaving at checked in then we were told the boat was leaving at as time time went on ppl were getting thirsty hungry the cafe had no food or drinks it was chaotic eventually a member of staff in a purple pick up went out bought sandwiches water handed them out to everyone that wanted them foc we also received a voucher per person to use on the boat we eventually left the port at pm queued for for some food which was limited menu we had a cheese burger chips a plain burger chips they didnt look fit for human consumption burger full of fat my son wouldnt eat it weve never experienced anything like this we were told to put a complaint in to stena which i did on the day of travelling i then put another complaint in ive heard nothing i dont think stena will reply so time for a review
the buffet for was a disaster canteen food no vegetarian alternative
terrible experience the tv turns on by itself at night or turns off during the day the toilet doesnt work reliably you get woken up in the middle of the night by unnecessary announcements and the ventilationair conditioning only works halfway the employees in the kiosk were rude and didnt want to sell us alcohol for example i didnt expect much for but i was still disappointed
if i cant even put my meal together then thats pretty bad for a restaurant if i have to pay then i want to eat what i want from the selection available stena line is getting worse and worse
just arrived thu may in hoek van holland from harwich with my service dog i have never felt so unwelcome with my dog when disembarking the people with dogs had to wait in their cabin until all other passengers had gone to their cars when we were allowed to go to the car deck it turned out that the cars were already driving off the boat our car blocked a row we had to get in with our dog and belongings while cars motorcycles and cyclists drove around us and some made it clear that we were blocking things plus being the last to get into our car feels like being a burden with our dog this is completely stressful for the dog the noise the air steno line could take an example from pampo where they know how to show respect for a pet when you are finally allowed to leave your cabin the hall is already full of cleaning carts and the staff hardly steps aside
no where to sit me and loads of other bikers sitting on the staircase as not enough seats for all passengers we payed our money a seat would have been nice
we really enjoyed our trip with stena line horizon congratulations to the staff very obliging and friendly renato can therefore be mentioned for the big compliment the food was very tasty the captains cabin was great best regards family de cockvelle
staff are rude and couldnt sleep in cabin i thought when you get a cabin its for privacy no not on stenna belfast to liverpool they allow the kids to run up and down corridors and have rooms to themselves and no adults shouting and screaming asked the staff for help or be moved but just got rude answer ended up giving my room key back and sat in lounge its quieter second sailing and my last staff need manners
my son asked for information in the lounge in rostock and was treated very rudely by the staff on the ferry itself the concierge was very friendly and attentive so much so that i even treated myself to a cabin and got a free upgrade with a window because i got claustrophobic in the inside cabin i didnt find the food attractive or very tasty but it was edible coffee from the machine is awful free internet is only available on the deck restaurant the cabin was clean and the bed linen smelled fresh the toilet smelled unpleasant but it was clean prices are absurdly expensive for germans i assume the swedes are used to it so definitely bring snacks etc
hi i am on the stenna line ferry to belfast i just had a meal and have never been so disgusted with a totally over priced and meagre portions of what was served i remember that the food use to be fabulous but i am sure the accountants are setting the prices and not the quality or quantity two chicken drumsticks with rice a total disgrace i wont be using them again
disaster cabin paid and confirmed and spent the night on the floor due to overbooking can happen but super arrogant behavior of employee at the service desk never again stena line
booked the hygge lounge for a night crossing as all cabins were booked up waste of time and money the tannoy never stops reminding people to turn off their car alarms when the restaurant is open what films are on in the cinema etc etc seats are permanently in a semi reclined position which i found uncomfortable for trying to sleep the allocated seat number did not exist and in spite of the fact that the tv has no sound an indication that this is a quiet area others sat on their phones or talking loudly with at least one f word in every sentence so no chance of sleeping my advice dont waste your money you will be just as comfortable elsewhere on the ship not impressed
cot that was provided in our room stunk of baby sick when we opened it used baby pram instead so they could sleep
first impressions on the ship were really good very fancy lots to offer and mostly pleasant and very helpful staff but the bad experiences started with the food pound for a sandwich are you actually joking i obviously paid it due to this trip being last minute and not prepping lunch youd think a pound sandwich would be great but honestly it tasted awful ive had pound land sandwiches that taste better then during the wait to start the return trip there was a guy being aggressive and very rude to check in staff and the officers but was still let on and an old guy that literally had to be pulled away from me by stenaline staff for being rude and aggressive toward my dog but was still let on the ship so i had a hour return trip filled with unease because the first guy just kept harassing everyone how is there no security on there i wondered back to the food twelve pound for what looked like a microwave burger and barely cooked chips tasted awful so to wrap this up stena line put on a fancy show and a heavy price tag but really its just a massive con
there were other people who had gotten the same room tickets as we had the same room number and the same pass to enter the cabin i am glad that these people were honest and requested new tickets at the service counter for the same they had entered the room when we were having dinner and our personal belongings were stolen from the room this gives an unsafe feeling i think well go with finnlines next time
we have booked a short trip from kiel to gothenburg with stenaline for the umpteenth time from december th the fact that the gangway has been out of service for a long time is annoying but access to the individual floors via the car deck worked well nobody could be blamed for the bad weather in gothenburg the fact that passengers were not allowed back on the ship until pm was also communicated in advance there are enough toilets in the terminal nobody has to endure anything with their legs clenched what we noticed is the apparently major shortage of staff the cabins not dirty but dusty smeared windows the floor in the bathroom was still wet buffet one employee for the hot buffetbread guests stood in line for several minutes waiting for refills unfortunately we also saw a lot of guests filling their plates so full that those following them looked into empty containers but stenaline cant do anything about that what was annoying was that only the taste restaurant was open this morning completely overcrowded rightly annoyed guests crying children guests had to take refuge outside the taste restaurant then there were no more knives the water smelled and tasted of chlorine many dishes such as the cheese were so cold that it could not be taken out individually important announcements could not be heard due to the noise why was there no information about the restaurant being closed for breakfast today thats why we only give it two stars we know stenalines short trips better
ship was good however the staff am not sure where they get their workers from but there was this guy called rolando at in the kitchen who never heard of customer service in his life before he was rude we asked him for hot water for our baby who is months old he refused to serve us and told us to complain this experience was the worse ever and he ruined our christmas
stena adventurer kitchen served out of date breakfast avocadoes were so old even sour taste beans changed their color and taste family members were sick and vomiting it was not sea sick because one of them skipper of fishing vessel disaster for bad breakfasts
hello today my wife and i are taking the am ferry from harwich to holland we are muslims and my wife wears a head covering when we wanted to go to the canteen the philippine gentleman told me that my wife was not allowed to sit in the canteen like that i was shocked and we left immediately shame on you you racists shame on you i will never travel with stena again i cant find anything like that on pampo or dfds
trip to dublin was horrendous so bumpy virtually the entire boat was throwing up staff were so kind and helpful and understanding everyone especially the cleaning crew and they had the most horrific job trip home again everyone really nice even though i refused to pronounce hygge as anything other than huggie ha ha cant wait until stena work a way to be able to dim the lights in the huggie lounge so we can use those cute reading lights assigned to each chair ps its feckin cold in there but the coffee machine makes up for it kind of ace staff really lovely as always
i hope they can evacuate the ship faster than they serve food and drink stood in line for no less than mins waiting for a cold coffee where are the instant machines food was awful and like warm at best beware they con folk using the own ships network there is no information on this anywhere clearly visible im sure they very kindly put it in very tiny letters at the bottom of the terms and conditions that were not given to me but finding out ive been charged for three msgs to be sent through whatsapp is almost criminal far far far too many people on the ship packed in worse than sardines way too many people than the staff knew how to handle kids run free so if you wonder what its like to be an overwhelmed primary teacher on a school trip youve found your ship provider they fall over every seconds as their parents do not know how to act right or teach their kids how to behave in public
ive just sailed on edda from birkenhead to belfast and back comfortable ship lots of seating two movie lounges free wifi electrical outlets the trip from birkenhead was a better experience than the one from belfast oct for the latter checking in at terminal due to construction at terminal we were not invited to check our large suitcases which had to accompany us up the escalator to the waiting area onto a bus to the kiosk at terminal off that bus and onto another bus which took us to the ship up the lift to the lounge decks and around the ship during the voyage staff shortages may mean that tables in the lounges are not cleaned during the voyage children are allowed to run around shrieking including into the quiet living room area and people get away with vaping inside i appreciate that the restaurant menu includes some vegan choices the breakfast plate was not good but i liked the bean chilli and warm roll at lunch lunch menu begins at pm so a mixed experience i would sail with stena again
kielgothenburgkiel there were two of us in a very narrow cabin with bunk beds the upper bed is right next to an air conditioning system that cannot be turned off very annoying and not exactly healthy the breakfast and evening buffet were absolutely top notch unfortunately there are no small bistros on board the staff were friendly and helpful throughout and the evening entertainment offered was forgettable so no comparison with the color line ferries by the way a visit to gothenburg is worthwhile
the staff is super nice and friendly the ship is kept very clean and the cabins are even very adequate the staff look after the customers we lost a tire from our suitcase and the staff kept it and even painted on it you cant get better food there everything was just great there was no fear on the ship perfect for children who want to move around so the parents have something too
cabin was wonderful but had a couple of problems on board one member of staff using foul language to another member of staff and being given the wrong duty free cigs but didnt realise until we got home
hallandica gotenborg to kiel we had the most expensive cabin but those places were right next to people who were there for other purposes drinking as much as possible together which caused a nuisance until late at night thin walls drinking is strongly promoted including an alcohol lottery you could no longer go to the restaurant despite trying to book online weeks in advance vegetarian option the classic veggie burger compared to colorline stenaline compares poorly on all fronts not a onetime experience but now a review after several years
we were completely satisfied the cabin was clean and the ship was clean and the staff was friendly
we traveled with stenaline from kiel to gotheburg on sunday august with persons we were very disappointed with our experience on board the cabin provided us with only one towel no cups in the bathroom no shampoo stains on the sheet in one bed and a broken down heating system when we reported this at the info desk we got an extra towel and cups without any explanation or excuse it sounded as if it is normal procedure that guests have to ask if they need a towel each there were more guests at the desk complaining about the heating failing the problem was not fixed but we got extra blankets and just had to put on some extra clothing all in all a sub par experience we complained by email right after but got a very late and copypaste style of answer more than a month later
poorly organized checkin vehicles that have just arrived are processed before others that have been waiting for hours the booked buffet time could not be used due to the slow checkin
trip with the stena danica from gothenburg to frederikshavn nice family corner with a playground for children unfortunately there is one big catch the seating area is separated by slot machines absolutely no go the planner didnt deserve his money all the changing rooms were locked only a changing table in the mens toilet next to the childrens play area was available the smell and condition were appropriate dear stena team saving is one thing hygiene is another
rostock trelleborg almost everywhere stairwells halls even on the floor of the restaurant gypsies are sleeping i couldnt sleep myself because it was warmer in my cabin than a sauna apparently you cannot determine the temperature of the hut yourself early in the morning i was woken up by a loudspeaker which literally hurt my ears and while i was walking out of the shower naked a cleaning lady walked into my cabin without knocking and then started shouting at me in swedish i wouldnt recommend anyone to travel with stenaline but what else are you going to do driving through denmark without a camper
add for a dining experience in connection with the holiday we have sailed on the route frederikshavn gothenburg with jutlandica we are now sitting at the buffet on deck we have bought buffet both ways and we have never had such poor food before in our lives the breakfast buffet seemed to have a good selection the quality is just not there the dinner buffet is totally poor in selection and the few hot dishes were cold but for nok per person i expect a little more than dry chicken skewers with the taste of fish fillet soft slathered chicken wings spaghetti meat sauce and chops it doesnt look very nice and it generally seems like the staffchef has given up better choose fewer dishes and focus on quality we wont eat here again so better a packed lunch the drinks are probably the only thing that can get top marks
only wanted coffee but had to queue for ages as other people ordering breakfast should be a separate queue just for coffee the decaff coffee tasted like dishwater in fact no taste at all decaff sachets apparently then overcharged for biscuits went back to show them the receipt member of staff grumpily put the cash in my hand with no apology chairs in standard lounge not very comfortable good calm crossing though and toilets were very clean
on the ms skane the indoor seating area with dogs has seats of course also for passengers without dogs with a few mini tables you can forget about wifi and there is no electricity at the seats either the hours in one place packed tightly together with other people can be fun and after a lot of research and inquiries to the german hotline i decided to go with the more expensive stena line well
with the stena horizon from cherbourg to rosslaire the cabin was in a very bad condition the bathroom door was practically hanging off the side and could only be opened or closed with force great force the catering area buffet was chaotically organized one person puts the food on the plate one operates the cash register and the coffee machine if you just want a coffee you have to wait in line for minutes truckers have a separate area people were standing there waiting their legs off because there were no customers if you want to be served at the buffet you are thrown out even though there are no other guests there
return trip dksweden worst first the return trip was to they decide to close the restaurant shortly before normal meal time actually starts no reasonable explanation why i asked getting off and on in gteborg is horrible also wifi was sketchy outbound had reserved seats these are placed in the middle of the childrens play area a mindboggling stupid decision left the seats i had paid for on top of this it is expensive never want to go again with stena line
stena britannica line from uk to nl is a disaster extremely slow and delayed boarding to the point that you wont manage dinner with your kids even though the boarding was supposed to start at we managed to get on board at around in the cabin were only two blankets and two towels for our three passenger crew and they kept making very loud and completely for us unnecessary announcements over the whole ship also inside cabins way over when our by then exhausted kid was trying to fall sleep also the bathroom smelled like rotten eggs and there was no soap this to be compared with the absolutely amazing experience on stena hollandica where boarding was from so we comfortably managed great dinner clean nice cabin with all we needed no nasty smells no announcements one company and such a huge difference sort it out
at the end of may we crossed from rostock to trelleborg on the quotmecklenburgvorpommernquot i already knew the ship from earlier times when the ferry still sailed under the german flag i actually had good memories of the ship from back then in contrast to its partner ship quotskanequot but since the reflagging to the swedish register the quotmecklenburgvorpommernquot has unfortunately also taken over the poor service on board unfriendly staff if you can even find anyone for this i give we had booked a breakfast buffet to our surprise the restaurant and the shop closed immediately after leaving the rostock harbor so there is hardly any time for breakfast the selection at the buffet was small but ok i can only advise against the scrambled eggs as not only the egg but also the eggshell was processed in them at least it was crispy but otherwise inedible all in all the breakfast was disappointing and is rated my tip bring all your food with you because you are allowed to sit in the restaurant area even if you dont order anything the seating area remains accessible even when the restaurant is closed the cabin was tidy and gets a rating of otherwise this ship has nothing to offer but thats not meant to sound negative after all any additional equipment would also increase the fare which is clearly visible with the competitor quotttlinequot instead it gets conclusion the priceperformance ratio is fine when you consider the crossing in future i would prefer to bring food and entertainment for the long crossing from home overall i give the ship a scant
good staff thats about all thats good food is horrible
unfriendly crew no information upper outside decks closed without explanation only crowded with smokers with a single bench for the whole ship possible a very unpleasant end to the holiday
everything is so over priced on this ship from wifi to food to cinema would not use again ship is overcrowded getting in wasnt too bad
just returned from a trip to ireland with stena i was so impressed with the staff the service and the ships delicious food in stena plus and the crew could not have been more helpful facilities were spotlessly clean too well done stena well be back many thanks
cabin was too loud due to the ventilation food was cold and breakfast selection was very limited you couldnt even take a coffee to the car in a paper cup because everything was immediately dismantled again as a truck driver you really cant sleep peacefully there because there are enough people who think theyre partying
service was ok the taste restaurant was terrible we ordered fish and chips at extortionate prices and a simple plain cheeseburger was a hassle for the chef when ordering kids chicken meals we expected chicken nuggets not rock solid cold dry half chicken breast not impressed at all upon returning the terrible kids meals the chef had a crappy attitude this was cairnryan to belfast on the save the money and bring your own food taste restaurant is a rip off and terrible food
ive travelled between belfast and liverpool more times than i can count it has been a very positive experience most of the time when the ship is quiet staff will go above and beyond they are all kind and helpful i feel like i can always ask for help and they will assist hot drinks are a good deal the food is reasonable they never have plain cheese toasties only ones with meat in the rooms are tidy and comfortable but the dust can be overwhelming the sky bar is usually empty so i do wish they served alcohol later than pmits a really long journey i do recommend stenaline however if you are travelling at night make sure you get a cabin because the hygge lounge chairs dont recline and the lights stay on full beam throughout the ship
belfast birkhead ferrynice new boatfood in the truckers lounge is absolutely brutaldry burnt un recognizable cheapest of cheap trashnearly always cheap porkworst food on the irish seasad to be honest
food overpriced and grim ship clean staff polite
myself and my husband are regular users of both the belfast to cairnryan and the belfast to liverpool ferries we have been using them for twenty years the standard of food in the stena plus lounge has recently become abysmal the dinnerlunch menu has been changed and it is impossible to eat a healthy meal or a tasty one chips are the gluten free choice apparently i had dry chicken breast bring your own sharp knife served with chips and no vegetables or salad i dont think its fair to blame the poor serving staff or in our case one steward but i wont be buying another meal on board a stena line ferry if this has been caused by covid restrictions or supply problems then it should be explained and people will know to bring their own food with them or simply fast until they reach dry land i wonder if the continental crossings serve such awful food or is it reserved for the englishscottishirish route perhaps an apology
just been told its mandatory to wear a mask if im walking about on the ferry there are alot of people walking about on the ferry without a mask but the old woman behind the barista bar told me to wear a mask i refuse to she was arrogant im not wearing a mask at all im the only one she has told me to wear a mask what about other people walking about or is it cause im not the same colour as her very awful arrogant woman there is staff that arent wearing masks aswel some that are wearing mask arent even covering there nose lol what a waste of staff
cant believe the generosity of some of the staff on my trip from liverpool to belfast am from phone staff helping us changing bookings due to restrictions to the staff on board a man on his first week with stena line went above his role to make sure we were comfortable and well looked after as if we and surrounding passengers were vips his friendly manner made our experience so much better as well as this a lovely lady went above and beyond to help us with a feminine hygiene emergency after explaining there was no products in the shop she immediately ran to grab some of her own for me an act of kindness i will never forget i wanted to thank them personally however also didnt want to distract them from their work as we were arriving to belfast thank you very much for your kindness and care have a lovely new year x
the usual targeting of individuals who need to bring a car needs to stop the prices are absolutely extortionate the stenaline service itself is the worst ive come across never any cabins available so made to sleep on the floor of the restaurant the restaurant itself is probably the worst thing about the crossing and thats saying something absolutely disgusting food that left me and my partner sick for days of our holiday and guess what it was overpriced they target individuals who need to take a car for one reason or another youd be doing well to find any travel service be it in the air land or by sea thats as bad value for money as these guys but they get away with it as they are let get away with it
paid for the premium lounge from holyhead to dublin no free wifi alcohol free beer no food other than cheap crisps and a cheap muffin coffee machines are out of order why on earth did i pay extra for premium ive had to leave the so called premium lounge to get food at extra cost very poor experience overall wont be paying for it again two stars as the ship didnt sink
what a tawdry experience the belfast cairnryan sailing is currently expensive too this tired and sad ship is a pale reflection of the wonderful hss that used to operate between belfast and stranraer id say this crossing has an element of the land that time forgot about it a case of regression instead of progression firstly the breakfast ive experienced it a number of times now to know it is beyond redemption a luke warm breakfast bap that is cold by the time youve rushed it to your table by the waydo not apply any of the cheap stena versions of ketchup or brown sauce as they seem to have been concocted by someone with a vinegar fetish breakfast was accompanied by coffee that tasted like tar it was the perfect foil for the bacon that tasted like it was cured in a wet salt mine breakfast bap is not cheap either be warned before your disappointment the seating areas are woeful pretty much cattleclass i havent experienced stena i hear its nice but why should i upgrade when i can write such a negative review from the discomfort of the bar seating areaand im talking fixed roundel chairs a kind of dr evil type of seating here so tight that you are trapped in your discomfort please stena just apply the electricity and be done with me the staff are lovely though a kind of hopeless camaraderie amongst the collective a real we are all in this mess together about them fair play they try but they know i could only recommend this route to someone incapable of swimming the distance themselves
booked the most luxurious cabin of stena line every year for the past years route goteborg kiel this year it was very disappointing no bubbles in the suite no wine no chocolate no bathrobe no slippers no fruit in short very poor you could get a glass of wine outside the hut but all extras were gone so it was very disappointing better to book a normal cabin dinner would start at pm we had booked a window seat which you have to pay extra per person at stena but this was suddenly not known at the counter after a lot of hassle we got a window seat but suddenly dinner was at pm instead of pm didnt receive any message about this in short bad business
the mandatory mouth and nose coverings are only worn by the staff of passengers do not wear masks and are not asked to do so by the cabin crew the food in the cafeteria is of canteen quality at best and the coffee is barely drinkable
on the sailing today from belfast to liverpool on stena edda enjoying the trip however the ladies serving food in the restaurant have absolutely crap attitudes making everyone feel like a nuisance i am a waitress who understands frustration with annoying customers but i have not in any way been annoying tone it down girls
great cabin clean and enough space and the bed was also comfortable good service good food a bit vague about the corona requirements but a phone call with hardly any waiting time provided certainty it is quite pricey but we arrived in kiel rested
during covid stena line makes you book a cabin during the journay supposedly to decrease risk of contagion this would make total sense if it wasnt because all the bars buffs etc were open and no one using face mask stena like had a great idea about how to make some extra cash out of the pandemic
really recommend travelling by stena line excellent service very friendly staff brendan was extremely helpful with regard to our kitten and went out of his way to ensure she was safe in the kennels cabin was spotless and comfortable had really nice breakfast as well thank you stena line for a pleasant journey
brilliant service from all staff especially john on the holyhead to dublin service john does the food and he is a true asset to the firm and a gentleman nicole also was great helping me with my cats thanks to all
absolutely fantastic company customer service couldnt have been more helpful as i tried to navigate corona tests and returning from the uk back to germany harwich to holland route i spoke with maybe or people and they were all so polite and helpful impressive as for the ship whilst most of the facilities were closed due to corona what was open was clean comfortable and convenient especially the amazing duty free prices the food was adequate think ikea restaurant quality the restaurant clean and the staff friendly the cabin was spotlessly clean spacious and the beds comfortable with towels provided really good value for money and an easy way to travel
never again service and friendliness are missing passengers are reminded of hygiene regulations but the crew does not wear masks and does not keep their distance cleanliness on board leaves a lot to be desired
use them all the time even this difficult year always warm with comfortable seating areas plenty of room and friendly staff will continue to recommend
do not use vending machines in holyhead port they rip you off with no way of refunding
i travel a couple of times a year on the liverpoolbelfast services and must say i really quite enjoy travelling this way it is expensive for car and person even factoring in the costs of flying and hiring a car but the pace suits me much more the new ship is significantly better than the outgoing ones and was a welcome improvement one area for attention is cabin cleanliness my most recent crossing was on both the old and new ships and i was surprised and a little disappointed to observe a fair amount of dust on the cabin floors finally crew can be a real let down generally the guest services staff are more interested in chatting across the lobby with the shop staff and my interactions with them were delivered without even making eye contact in the restaurant service was fine but again not friendly or welcoming and it is frustrating to sit in the bar and have to listen to the loud music coming from the kitchens along with the occasional shouting and colourful language from a covid perspective many staff could use instructions on how to wear a mask as they were being worn everywhere but where they should be on my crossingforehead chin neck in pockets the beauty of this though is you can simply limit your interactions with staff by staying in your cabin but theres no doubt that if they were friendlier id be more inclined to spend more money onboard
everything was ok except for the lack of lounge areas and wifi everywhere on board i will travel with stena line again
