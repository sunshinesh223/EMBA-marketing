i would never book aida again absolute ripoff i was promised something by ms khlellers aida travel advisor which was not kept i am traveling from bochum to hamburg airport the same goes for the return journey the trip costs euros for a week in an inside cabin during the summer holidays but i was deprived of a day in mallorca due to changed flight times instead of leaving at pm as promised the flight back now leaves at am so we have days left for that price the trip would now cost the same for a week from dsseldorf but with a sea view cabin aida is not taking any of that so tough luck if you type aida ripoff into google you will find it very quickly because zdf is now on the ball too you feel like youve been really ripped off never again i have no desire to even go on this trip anymore
it was another really great experience as always but only almost perfect aida experience suggestions for improvement free wifi must always be included in the package the current regulation is no longer up to date marseille was not such a good port of call we would have been better off staying on the ship journey home transfer by bus all passengers had to put their suitcases in the bus themselves that was surprising and particularly unreasonable for older passengers
unfortunately this shipping company is not right for us we tried it a few times but we couldnt get used to the concept far too many children we have them too and we love them just not so many on one ship everything costs extra far too few staff the poor team works tirelessly and still cant keep up fortunately there is enough choice so there are plenty of happy aida customers and we would be happy to continue traveling with the ship in the future but then again with a different shipping company
for me it was very adventurous because it was my first time but thanks to the friendly staff i was able to find my destinations and my cabin very quickly the terminals that were distributed all over the ship with a signpost were also very helpful in finding your way around the internet still needs a bit of work because there were always problems otherwise everything was really wonderful and highly recommended i will definitely recommend aida see you soon
the ship and the service on board were great the shore excursions were sometimes disappointing and generally too expensive for what was offered the tour at the beginning was helpful for orientation as the ship was impressively large the fjords impressed me a lot even though i had read about them before
for the first time we treated ourselves to a cruise with aida aida cosma a western mediterranean balcony cabin with the full allinclusive premium package it was a lovely trip for us and all in all it was perfect now for the things that werent perfect if i book the allinclusive premium i expect everything to be included and not have to pay for certain things eg ice cream and beer in the brewery a joke for me and then the shuttle from the ship to town around minutes for two people euros completely overpriced those are the things that bothered me and marseille isnt worth a trip totally run down but thats my opinion of the city
overall the number of people on board was too large for us in the future we will choose a smaller ship
i was on the aidacosma with my granddaughter from february th to february th the route was gran canariamadeiragran canaria my th trip with aida on february st my wallet with all my papers was stolen from my handbag during a shore excursion in tenerife despite repeated inquiries the ships staff did not offer me any help and i had to go to the police alone without any knowledge of spanish later the onboard bill was incorrect drinks were charged despite quotall inclusivequot despite repeated inquiries my complaints novg c were not answered to this day i have not been reimbursed for the overcharged drinks result never again aida christa niehus
one day after completing the booking i wanted to change the flight to another airport the lady at customer service was friendly and after consulting with an authorized person told me that this was not possible customer friendliness looks different
a few alternative ports and routes would be great always the same destinations are boring in the long run
when i got on board i was extremely skeptical i disembarked with an aida ship
the experiences were all good especially the organization for mobility impaired and otherwise disabled passengers was very good
the ports visited offered many sights
the forwarding of the suitcases is very bad
very personal despite the size of the ship
negative experience with aida shop we had bought a travel film of the aida trip quottreasures of the mediterraneanquot from april th to th we received it weeks later about a third were neutral technical pictures which you get on any trip a third were neutral impressions and only a few isolated excursion pictures the label was neutral with no reference to the trip why does a company take so long to make a boring meaningless film for a lot of money on previous trips the film was made by the crew on board was much more meaningful and you received it when you left the ship conclusion money wasted this piece of work is not a real memory
it was a great trip with a few small setbacks but they didnt spoil the overall trip the destination ports were very well chosen
the elevators were often full and there were long waits perhaps one could mark one elevator for disabled people
far too many passengers less would be more
we found out about the monthslong problems with the alleged norovirus on the nova from the internet and there was nothing else on the ship except alert level yes hands had to be disinfected but that wasnt enough difficult with the german health authorities on an italian ship too
german guests staff had to speak german even though many could speak other languages many announcements and information only in german internet service too expensive but that generally applies to all cruises boarding and shore excursions run smoothly
our anticipation of gothenburg was taken away from us what would have happened if the sea or wind on arrival and departure in warnemnde had been the same as before gothenburg would the ship not have been able to dock and the guests would have been able to disembark and the passenger transfer could have taken place on previous cruises there have been stormy days higher waves and more sea and this captain did a masterful job and brought the ship safely into port but captain marcdominique tidow seems to be quite inexperienced having decided too early not to go to gothenburg all ports are now so well protected by the piers that you can pass through them safely captain tidow was also not very talkative unfortunately very taciturn compared to other aida captains who welcome passengers in every port and welcome the guests back when they set off and wish them a pleasant day on land this little something makes a big difference just put yourself in the guests perspective there is a saying that fits perfectly the fish always starts to stink from the head you get the feeling that the management on board trains the employees to educate the guests but sometimes they are not doing it with their heart and passion the quality of service and the fun of working has declined enormously as always coffee machines with taps were ordered in advance for the cabin but this time without water when we asked at reception after consulting the manager we were told to use the water from the tap in the shower which contains chlorine not really true is it on all other trips there were bottles of still water with the coffee machine not on aidamar because we booked the drinks package we had to stroll around the ship every day with glasses of water to enjoy our morning coffee no service just do it yourself so the glasses were piling up in the cabin thank you for that positives the feeling of being back on board the view from the balcony entering and leaving the harbor watching the ships dock and cast off the smell of the shower the homemade bread and rolls world class on the unplanned sea day instead of gothenburg there was a special sale on board at the aida shops for if the shop manager hadnt advised us so well to choose a third item because the third was free the shop employees would have kept it a secret from us when we wanted to pay for the three items at the cash register the employee charged us the full price instead of just items only after the manager served us again were we given the for discount apparently the urge for commission was too high unfortunately there was no apology just a grimace on the sea day we used the snack cake at the bar for the first time the selection was no longer available after minutes and by the time the cake was served the coffee was already cold again or had to be reordered thanks to the drinks package we didnt mind the coffee in the restaurants has also become undrinkable the quality has dropped dramatically compared to years ago fully automatic coffee machines have become indispensable two machines in the restaurants are recommended as the queues show how much importance is placed on quality and taste not to mention the better canteen food in the buffet restaurants some of the food in the chafing dishes looks unappetizing the soups used to be more appealing but now they look like leftovers
i prefer traveling on mediumsized ships
its a shame that the company no longer has small ships such as the aida aura we took it to greenland the port of ilimanaq greenland is not suitable for larger ships smaller ships can call at several small ports this makes the program more colorful and interesting
we have been travelling with aida for years and actually think it is great service food drinks friendly service great excursions actually there is nothing to complain about this year there are bills that were not used when i left the ship the remaining bill was euros a demand for euros came in the mail aida noticed the error but i have to pay first before i get a refund
hello everyone i am now traveling with the aida for the third time and was seen at the entrance at am but we could not send in because we did not book early check in for me this is a pure ripoff
unfortunately i have to give it one star this is too many what happened due to a serious illness coma i forgot to transfer the deposit on time aida cancelled the trip and on the same day that the cancellation was announced i paid the deposit via realtime transfer aida charged me around cancellation fee per person people to reinstate the trip so a total of additional costs this will be our last aida trip im not looking forward to it its very sad how aida insists on their arb aida doesnt focus on people only on money in my opinion charging around for a job that takes a maximum of minutes is extortionate aida only knows one thing driving up prices instead of giving people a nice vacation it should also be mentioned that we have already travelled with aida several times this year will be the last time but that doesnt bother aida as they have enough cruisers aida acts completely without empathy and insists on their terms and conditions
this was our second trip on an aida ship although i wasnt really happy with it the first time the trip fell perfectly in time for the whitsun holidays and the route was also very nice so we thought wed give aida another chance a few weeksmonths before the start of the trip there was a change of route so we spent a total of days in copenhagen in the weeks however as copenhagen is a really beautiful city this was not a problem the journey there was no problem and shortterm parking at the cruise terminal was also very well arranged checkin was quick and convenient so we were on board quickly unfortunately people underestimate what almost passengers on the ship mean almost all areas are overcrowded most of the time the pools are a lot smaller than on the other aida ships despite the higher number of passengers when traveling during holiday periods there are often people in the pool which is only approved for lifeguards are generally not provided here we can only recommend switching to smaller aida ships or another cruise company the spa area is subject to an additional charge which is not a big deal in principle as you dont spend every day in the spa however you are then tied to certain times morning or afternoon if you are on holiday with children you may also like to go to the sauna spontaneously room service unfortunately it is often overloaded which means that the rooms are often cleaned after pm used towels that were deliberately placed on the floor were then folded up and returned to our bathroom damp and with makeup residue after this happened repeatedly i changed the towels myself however it should be the guests decision how long heshe wants to use the towels and not left to the room service the empty water bottles were not regularly replaced with full ones our hammock was taken down for the balcony cleaning but unfortunately it was not hung up properly on the hook which meant that it was on the floor unfortunately the balcony drain was right there which meant that our hammock was lying in a broth of pollen and dirt and was completely wet restaurants the restaurants were consistently overcrowded because of the strict opening hours passengers were already standing in front of the restaurant in masses and rushing in like crazy to get a seat in the buffet restaurants the allergens on the dishes are clearly marked in other restaurants unfortunately this is not the case at all the staff are unfortunately no help here instead of giving the kitchen free rein they simply leave out everything that you cant eat then you quickly end up with a pork knuckle without any side dish or sauce at casanova they were particularly kind to me when i ordered spaghetti with prawns and pointed out that i cannot tolerate dairy products after asking the kitchen three times i was served glutenfree penne without prawns just for your information neither spaghetti nor prawns contain dairy products so you would have expected a different sauce when i went to reception because of a broken tv remote control i pointed out the allergen problem in the restaurants and also recommended that they add this to the menu this makes it easier to find something suitable unfortunately the lady at reception then lectured me that it was so much better and that my criticism was completely unfounded in addition the batteries in the tv remote control were replaced even though i explained several times that it was not the batteries that were the problem as some buttons still worked but not all of them and lo and behold the remote control still didnt work excursions we only booked one excursion through aida as we received an onboard credit when we booked now it must be noted that you have to book the excursions before the trip begins in order to get anything at all unfortunately you then have to pay for the excursion via paypal on board the excursion was then booked to the onboard account but the amount already paid was also booked to the onboard account at reception we were assured several times that we would be reimbursed for the unused onboard credit from our paypal payment we have now been home for days and so far we have not received a refund from aida now in addition to the hassle during the vacation i also have to deal with aida after the vacation conclusion never again aida it even rhymes
some people are now looking for ways to earn money it used to be free but now its a paid trip previously checkin was only possible for a fee even though the checkin staff had nothing to do but then suddenly there were passengers at the same time some ports arent that nice you cant see anything else there all in all i actually love traveling with aida hopefully that will change again soon
the departure booked through aida was a disaster once you get off the ship you have to take matters into your own hands
poor communication and information with passengers in the event of problems on or with the ship the entire holiday relaxation is gone in just a few hours a shame
the shore excursions are about to times more expensive than with the local company which ultimately runs the excursions a blatant example a km bus ride to the foot of a mountain and a subsequent hike of about m up the mountain and back to the ship duration hours costs per person with aida i find this to be a complete ripoff
let me put it this way the evening before the return flight which would have been at am there is a note on the door saying that you are flying back to frankfurt instead of cologne where the car is of course aida only takes you to germany and not to the airport you booked in despite aida changing the evening flight you are of course thrown out of your room in the morning and taken to the airport much too early you also have to pay for the train ticket from frankfurt to cologne yourself and can only submit it afterwards there is no willingness to compromise at reception for me this was the last cruise with aida
unfortunately the berths in the harbors were right next to or opposite docked ferries these make a deafening noise so that you cant leave the balcony door open weve never experienced anything so extreme in all the trips weve been on
we have been travelling with aida and other shipping companies for years that means we can compare well when you see how much aida has cut back on quality customer focus and service in recent years but has always increased prices you realise that something is wrong its a shame i hope that changes and improves again
now that we are back home and everything has returned to normal i wanted to share my not so great experiences here traveling to major cities with the aidaprima from may th to june st transfer hamburg we booked the transfer from hamburg hbf to prima online and then had to wait a good half an hour to drop off our luggage because there was a line all the way into the station at the bus terminal we then had to queue for a good hours from the zebra crossing to the bus charging money for this quotservicequot is really not worthy of aida premium we booked premium unfortunately it didnt feel like that bottles of water in the cabin every day which we wouldnt have gotten if i hadnt pointed this out to the room staff or reception almost every day towels were not replaced without request although they were put down accordingly toilet paper was not replenished promptly either so you could only do your quotbusinessquot with your own towels drinks amp bars after the rd or th day there was no more nonalcoholic sparkling wine available at the bars so many of the drinks we would have liked were no longer available these drinks were then served to customers at one or two bars with tonic water as a replacement for the sparkling wine without any information being given from the th day nonalcoholic gin was no longer available at various bars and so were mixed drinks made with it one final word we are enthusiastic aida passengers but the last two trips were very sobering at times i have already sent my quotexperiencesquot to aida customer service but all they said was that they were sorry and would be happy to welcome us back on the last trip they at least apologized for the inconvenience with a small consolation prize
the crew was always there for the passenger problems were minimized or if they occurred solved thanks to the crew
i have to report a very unpleasant experience with aida on thursday may th my husband and i found a used condom which must have been left there by previous passengers on the floor in our cabin at around pm our year old son had previously been playing in the lounge of the cabin and moved the mattress of the sofa there he was being watched from a distance at the time but we did not have him in our sight all the time it is therefore quite possible that he touched the condom or in the worst case even put it in his mouth we immediately contacted reception and the hotline housekeeping cleaned it straight away but the damage had already been done the reaction from aida was more than disgraceful the incident was described as an inconvenience and minimal compensation was offered i find such a health risk for small children more than an inconvenience we will cancel our trip which we had already booked for december and will never go on holiday with aida again i am appalled at the casual handling of such an incident for us this does not demonstrate a sense of responsibility for the safety of passengers
disgusting ripoff in absolutely every respect not even of the price would be justified i will never board one of these rotten boats again not even for free the biggest waste of money and time i have ever experienced never again i dont even want to start talking about these clowns in customer service whether in writing or by phone
we had a great week on board with lots of new impressions the ports were great and we also enjoyed the days at sea the service staff were motivated and always helpful
i would like to summarize my experience with aida the day trip was well organized and we felt very comfortable on board my conclusion on departure if i were to use aida again other shipping companies also have beautiful ships i would definitely not book the shuttle and train through aida aida recommended that the train should depart at am at the port quotnot before amquot our train left shortly before without us the baggage claim was delayed and we queued for more than minutes at the quotaida shuttlequot in response to our complaint aida replied with the text quotbook a return train journey with enough bufferquot this is of course a nice statement we had planned too little time with hours mind you from the hamburg pier to hamburg central station i would now like to get an answer from aida as to what quotsufficientquot is or hours to be honest ill also be in new york during that time the fourstar rating does not refer specifically to the departure or to aida customer service but because i want to be fair about the quotcrew performancequot on board
rarely have i seen such criminals real robber barons not only are the prices beyond good and evil which cannot be justified by anything the cancellation fees they rip you off for among other things should be punishable by the maximum penalty miserable vultures never again and the trip is also an absolute disaster even of the price would still be too much actually the saying goes quotif you have nothing positive to say then if in doubt you shouldnt say anything at allquot but it would simply not be fair to these guys to let it disappear in silence so here you go
an excursion booked through aida is an absolute disaster a signed nautical chart was offered as compensation but the message only came shortly before leaving the ship so there was no opportunity to talk very unprofessional unworthy of aida handling of the complaint no reimbursement of costs
great ship great route but unfortunately many services could not be used because there were simply too many people on the ship and some things were not organized properly
better information via the onboard portal often not accessible carry out excursions as offered directly with a tour guide on the bus improve service at the bars very long waiting times
very good organization by the company booking and paying was childs play full cost control wide range of offers in all areas personal contact person on land beautiful harbors that make you an explorer
we have been travelling with aida for almost years the smaller ships were more personal i can understand that some things have to be cut back or that they can no longer be done due to a lack of staff but you shouldnt overdo it for example new cocktails or monotony in the selfservice restaurants
two years ago we could cancel excursions we had booked on the ship free of charge up to half an hour before the trip started you got your money back immediately as onboard credit now you cant do that anymore you are obliged to take part in the overpriced excursions you have booked this flexibility is what made aida stand out families could cancel free of charge if they had sick children migraines or other personal reasons aida has become very impersonal and digitalization means you have to carry your cell phone with you all day two years ago you had the onboard program every evening in the form of brochures on your door
very good service on board we felt very comfortable however the shore excursions have become very expensive
the shore excursions
it was a great ship there was something for every age but there were too many people on board the entertainment was great and the service was very very friendly
i have booked a trip to spitsbergen for next year from may th to th it was supposed to be a unique experience for my birthday on may rd of this year i received an email saying that aida was not going to spitsbergen but to great britain we were offered a rebooking to a date in july when i first asked i was told that i could rebook to another trip today i tried to rebook i wanted to go to southern norway between may th and may nd since this trip is cheaper ms karaurgan told me that rebooking was not possible my recommendation for anyone who wants to book a trip book at short notice and choose the vario tariff saves both your nerves and your wallet
incredibly good service the staff were almost always in a good mood and constantly performed to give us a great travel experience our expectations were more than exceeded there was something for everyone and at the highest level
shuttle harbor buses excursion on your own
free decision how i want to spend my shore leave
never again aida valuables approx forgotten in the desk drawer on departure reported to aida the same day and immediately reported the loss including photos of all valuables after about weeks a terse email was sent saying that nothing had been found in the cabin for me that can only mean a the cabin is not cleaned properly otherwise the jewelry would have been found by the onboard staff and handed over to the lost and found office on board b there are quotblack sheepquot among the onboard staff who embezzle and appropriate found items another attempt to contact aida received no response but that was just the tip of the iceberg the failures bad luck and mishaps ran like a common thread through the entire trip only the route norwegian fjords and the impressions on site were fantastic but that is the credit of the beautiful nature and not aida this was our th cruise with aida and we had already booked another cruise for december but we canceled it again despite the high cancellation fees you dont have to put yourself through that sorry but we will never travel with aida cruises again
disappointingly let down we were on the aidaprima from hamburg with a day at sea to southampton le havre and zeebrugge we didnt get any further my daughter started to get ill on the ship we went to the doctor once and he said she had a cold she had a fever and was on bed rest but two days later it didnt get any better she also got a rash and a coating on her tongue so we went back to the doctor and were told straight away that it was scarlet fever but they hadnt tested for it an antibiotic was obtained because my daughter is allergic to some things and they asked for a different one in le havre according to them no suitable antibiotic could be found in any of the surrounding pharmacies and we were told to leave the ship the next day in zeebrugge and now we were there and were left completely alone with it no transport home didnt get off and look where you are poor aida never again thanks for nothing
the aida holiday feeling has unfortunately been lost on the large ships we have been on aidanova twice in months and were disappointed by the ship both times it is like a fair on the sea in the buffet restaurants plates were constantly missing and it took a long time for the buffets to be refilled the food in the individual restaurants hardly varied at all and the themes of the individual restaurants were completely lost the elements and the pools on aidanova are a joke for the size of the ship the facilities are completely overwhelmed by the number of passengers depending on occupancy many services have been cut if i as a family spend almost per week on a trip without flights then i have certain expectations i think after cruises in years with different ships and shipping companies i can compare quite well the famous aida feeling and the cruise feeling have been lost on the nova its all about maximizing profits and the regular guests feel it too you have to pay extra for many services that used to be included there are far too few staff on the big ships even the staff say that about the nova cruises were a passion of ours standing at the railing and looking out to sea but this illusion was destroyed by the nova unfortunately you feel like youre at a fairground for a week its also a problem when passengers disembark in small nordic destinations and completely overcrowd them so its understandable that the locals are happy when everyone leaves in the evening
actually cruises are only about making money for the company you can arrange it a little differently so that you as a passenger have the feeling
the entire package including arrival and departure was organized almost perfectlyi cant fault anything
they werent taken just to see a ship from the outside didnt even get the money back for the upgrade booked aida for the first time and never again you want to do everything right and book by phone so that all your questions are answered everything was answered its just a shame that there was also a false statement that our vacation was already over before we got on the ship my wife is a filipino citizen we have been married for years and have lived in germany since then i asked on the phone whether she needed a visa because we were docking in great britain and was told quotno just a passportquot so i trusted that and the nasty surprise came when we checked in on the ship and they werent taken on after we were told that a ship was leaving the next day that would stay in europe i was supposed to call customer service and ask if we could rebook however they were not at all accommodating and said straight away that all the money was gone and that it wasnt possible i would have paid an extra charge but no chance its a real shame when you save up for a whole year for your vacation and get no help at all ive never experienced anything like that before ive never given a bad review before but theres no other way here
norwegian fjords are worth several trips
aida is very active in advertising a deposit for the next trip with onboard credit but unfortunately i booked it on site on the ship and didnt get any confirmation it didnt work after several phone calls no effort was made to correct the mistake quite the opposite aida is catastrophic in terms of organization employees on the ship provide different information than the shipping company in rostock
traveled in the mediterranean on the aida stella unfortunately the whole thing didnt quotpick me upquot in my opinion aida as a premium cruise operator has problems with the service the priceperformance ratio is not right beveragecocktails very different long waiting times at the bars mainly poor and inattentive service furniture sometimes not up to date oldfashioned too few service staff in many areas of the ship for me an aida cruise is no longer an option its a shame aida didnt manage to leave a lasting good impression on us
we have traveled with aida many times and will continue to do so but there are always things that remain unpleasant in our memories for example the aida diva was in a very bad state of repair during corona and the engines were not working properly so that ports could not be called at how aida deals with such things towards customers is always a problem one would wish for more friendliness in order to solve the problems easily if necessary through compensation usually this can only be done with a lawyer unfortunately no customer wants something like that dear aida my sister suffered a slipped disc on this trip she had to lie in the cabin for days until the departure airport my husband and i had to handle the food supply completely on our own aida did not manage to assign someone to look after my sister at least partially so that we could also have a vacation after all we had also booked a vacation and our own cabin sad the medical care was great most of the time experienced older doctors travel with us we were satisfied with that even with a broken rib that i sustained in after a fall on board but even then i had to fight for days until i could get a better firmer mattress and the ships doctor had to intervene at the end of my sisters trip it was not possible to organize a wheelchair to the transfer buses in the end we hobbled laboriously to the buses she in pain all of this bordered on failure to provide assistance conclusion as long as you book pay are satisfied and dont complain or do any work aida cruises are great we love the uncomplicated cruise on the smaller ships but nothing can go wrong then you feel left alone and your opinion discredited im already curious to see how my descriptions will be downgraded again my husband and i currently wanted to book the world trip on the diva i am severely disabled with a chronic illness because of the vaccinations i wanted a short list of the countries the order in which they would be visited the yellow fever vaccination is mandatory if you come from a highrisk country aida was unable to send me a list of just the countries all i ever got was a page pamphlet with all the countries that aida generally visits and what visas and vaccinations are needed for each country but i couldnt forward that to the rki they wanted to help me find out which vaccinations were really important and necessary in my specific case the foreign office had told me about it and the route description only listed the ports so i was supposed to sit down and write a list myself i found that strange considering the high price of the trip there was no sign of the advertised help and there were two more obstacles that concerned a possible free rebooking from our premium booking it would only have been possible to rebook to a trip of approximately the same length so days we had hoped to split the trip into maybe trips with a heavy heart we decided against that with years until departure it was too risky for us despite travel cancellation insurance with adac just under eur so as i said aida is great when nothing out of the ordinary happens on board you dont want anything special apart from the usual and youre happy with everything which is often the case but aida often reacts strangely and stubbornly to disruptions or not at all our penultimate tour with the nova over christmas was also strange the last port of call copenhagen was canceled due to a storm warning the large ship was probably worried about sailing on the elbe in a storm so the port was canceled without replacement and we were back in hamburg a good day early we were then offered a shuttle bus to hamburg city and of course only for a fee that sums it up thats how aida works by the way how aida deals with problems on the route in storms or similar cannot from a legal point of view be to the detriment of the customers but a solution based on consumer law does not come automatically both aida and meinschiff are already booked againwe are not going to let the pleasure of a cruise be spoiled especially since air travel is very stressful for us we have also traveled with ncl there are good and bad things everywhere but unfortunately aida always deals with problems noticeably worse so i am still happy to recommend aida despite the concerns mentioned just take a look for yourself
size of the ship good
uncomplicated booking very friendly consultant everything went very well from arrival to departure day
unfortunately the priceperformance ratio is getting worse and worse some employees are extremely unfriendly seem annoyed and prefer to keep themselves busy and whats more changes to the departure date that were already planned and known within aida beforehand were not communicated or were only communicated incompletely or incorrectly and services that had already been paid for were not provided we were actually quotparkedquot on a finca in the middle of nowhere including a socalled lunch menu that bordered on impudence and despite having booked allinclusive services drinks that were subject to payment you were practically forced to do this if you didnt want to stroll through palma with all your luggage from am and then take care of the return trip to the airport yourself by taxi note we booked the complete arrivaldeparture package and allinclusive
the trip was accompanied by emails and information from the beginning no room was left to chance
impudence to the third degree we were sent to a finca on the last day a disaster there were lice and ticks in the food the allinclusive package we had booked for the last day didnt count at the finca we were driven to the airport hours before our departure if thats aida then congratulations to tui cruises i will travel with you again
we had to pay for a taxi to barcelona airport ourselves for although we could have used a transit to the airport for free if the promised bus had been there the staff at the appointment were wearing polo shirts with aida logos but had no idea and were completely overwhelmed with us the lack of organization and repeated misinformation at reception are probably responsible aida cosma barcelona
a nice party boat aida land tours are very overpriced
aidasol scotland the crew was friendly and helpful the ship was clean and well equipped the food was good the excursions were only partially recommendable as there was immense time pressure and everything had to be done quotat a breakneck pacequot the tendering in newhaven and the communication about the reasons was inadequate in kirkwall we were stood up by the tour guide which would not have been bad if the futile waiting had not cost us valuable time
the bed arrangement was a challenge for people with limited mobility as stated distance between bed edge and wall m getting in and out was difficult
excursions revised in terms of price and service provided
cruise quotroute norway amp metropolises from hamburg to kielquot if you want to get to know western europe or norway a cruise quotroute norway amp metropolises from hamburg to kiel with aidanovaquot is recommended excursions are good and expensive if you speak a second language you could save a few euros service and food on board are perfect and evening entertainment is more economical than previous trips on smaller aida ships sea days and evenings are more familyfriendly and comfortable and you can also make use of the bar more often aidas priceperformance ratio was a lot better some time ago egi
we traveled with the aidanova from may th to may th unfortunately a lot went wrong my eldest wanted to do his seahorse badge there unfortunately there was no lifeguard on board the staff in the kids club were very annoyed and unfriendly to us so our kids didnt feel comfortable there and didnt want to play there on the other hand the restaurants were overcrowded even though we had often visited the family restaurant fuego eating with the kids was therefore very stressful for a shore excursion we booked the hop and off bus unfortunately the bus didnt arrive at the stop until hours later which of course is a disaster with kids in the heat despite complaints no refund was given conclusion we cannot recommend the aidanova with kids priceperformance ratio is too expensive
not correct company have nothing to do with passenger pbs advice to run away because they are not respectful in many things
ive already been on short trips and it was always something special in my opinion the safety instructions have been simplified for everyone but i felt a little safer that way it was also a bit of a spectacle even though you had to wait for every single passenger the service has deteriorated a little over time but everyone is still friendly and helpful as usual
there were too many guests and far too few crew on board we were actually allowed to use the quotfast lanequot but it took us minutes to get there in the terminal
everything is ok but the prices for excursions should be urgently calculated
this was my th cruise but my st and last with aida in order to get a place to eat in the evening you have to reserve a table in the la carte restaurants or speciality restaurants long before the cruise begins this is of course an extra charge like everything else if you dont want to be pushed back and forth furthermore in order to get a free lounger on deck you have to get up very early and reserve a lounger otherwise its almost impossible to get a free seat it is also the only shipping company i know that compulsively builds in sea days to make money you have to pay for everything that doesnt happen on msc and costa and if your suitcase breaks on departure not our fault then you are left with the costs they even say that if the suitcase is only years old it is under warranty and you should submit it yourself hello that is not a warranty case but damage caused by force majeure in any case the damage will not be compensated in any case this is actually the worst shipping company i know and i will never book another cruise with aida because they just rip people off
priceperformance ratio has dropped significantly fewer service staff return journey chaotic hour delay can happen but after that no support from aida although aida was the sole tour operator we were referred to the airline next time another shipping company can try
from booking to the journey home everything worked great again thank you
the tour and the layover times were good the ship urgently needs an overhaul
we were on the nova twice and on the cosma once this time we wanted to go on a smaller ship and test it out we liked it times better than the huge ships great crew great program and everything in an ideal size stars for the auidablu simply top
to get to know the ship in size
promised onboard credit is not paid out with crazy and deceitful explanations out of stars a disgrace
short trip from gdansk to bornholm warnemnde the ship is showing its age the staff are strange and seem to be without leadership no drinks package except for light ones the ship travels at knots and then only stays on land for hours why
i would prefer to give zero stars the service that aida is providing is absolutely unworthy according to the travel documents checkin is from pm on site we were pushed into the last time slot no one could show us where this was written in black and white it was an absolute disgrace to make people stand in front of the ship for almost hours without giving a reason would i still travel with aida certainly not with the poor service
the arrival at pm was too late the departure at am was too early we lost a whole day of vacation
top service on board good selection of shore excursions to book
hello your customer service is the worst i have ever experienced we will not travel with you again there are so many providers and you stood out in a very negative way having to deal with your customer service weeks after the trip is more of a sad rather than positive reflection on the trip
aida railampfly is promised but of course the code doesnt work after an hour flight with no children aida doesnt want to know anything about it of course we were left with the costs a very very bad thing for such a company my ship is happy
poor service high excursion prices
friendly staff who really try hard nice tour nice ship
departure by bus to the airport it was not an orderly journey instructions to the bus very unfriendly people
i give the ship and its crew
the journey on this ship is an experience if you are booking a cruise for the first time you should choose a smaller ship than the cosma otherwise there is no way to increase the size
the trip was recommended by a friend who raved about his last trip on the aidacosma so we went on a day trip from the canaries to mallorca unfortunately the first problems started with the safety briefing even before the trip the aida app offers the entry of access data name cabin number and pin in order to be able to access the onboard portal via wifi more quickly on board if only someone had written in the app that umlauts have to be written out ae oe ue because of failed logins both travelers in the cabin were initially locked out of the onboard portal for security reasons on the onboard portal page which you can access via the mobile phone browser you are advised how to deal with umlauts and the safety briefing on the cabin tv didnt really work in the first two attempts these are the small problems that simply dont have to happen after a hour journey by train plane and bus in the end it somehow worked out even though i was really annoyed at times unfortunately the onboard portal was not really errorfree for the rest of the trip the display of the weather information and the ships position froze in midapril so you either had to wait for the captains announcements or look for the small patch of internet on board from land to check the weather so you could dress appropriately for the shore excursion at some bars i found the service to be very slow long waits before you could even order long waits until the ordered drink arrived unfortunately several orders for example at the art bar were simply lost at some bars this improved over the course of the trip at others it did not but there were also bars that had excellent service right from the start for example the tokyo bar the entertainment and the excursion offers quickly made up for the initial negative experiences but new different problems quickly emerged in the bars and specialty restaurants drinks and dishes were repeatedly missing from the menu something was always missing which is why there was no drink unfortunately even for several days in spite of all the misfortune we left with one of the first transfers in palma de mallorca i also couldnt understand why all the specialty coffee machines were turned off at breakfast time in the market restaurant it cant really be the fault of the billing as we had booked the drinks package so all we had was coffee from the pot which wasnt exactly convincing so you look forward to going home where the fully automatic coffee machine is available even at am all in all this trip had the potential to be really great a lot could have been avoided with better itapp support better personnel planning and better inventory management i could have lived with one or two minor things without wanting to mention them here but the minor things added up what a pity
aida charter flight changed aida will not cover any costs for changing the package tour
i booked a trip for people for eur i then booked the rail ticket for two people with aida and then the train journey now aida wants cancellation fees for this train ticket because an employee canceled it they tell you on the phone that the cancellation fees will be taken out and nothing will happen the next day they say that the employee made false promises emails are answered in an irrelevant manner or not at all i am very disappointed
we were in kirkwall with the prima in midapril among other places there we had to give up our berth to the aida sol the unplanned tendering caused chaos with long waiting times the quotcustomer servicequot responded to a specific complaint with a standard email and then went into hiding that was probably the last trip with aida
we traveled with aida cosma the ship was great the service during handling to the airport and the subsequent service communication with aida couldnt have been worse enormous processing times no insight and no solution whatsoever aida left us at the port with two small children and did not carry out the airport transfer booked through aida the taxi costs incurred were not covered due to the ignorance of finding a solution we are having the matter examined by a lawyer
our th cruise in total the second with aida unfortunately it will be the last with aida the metropolis tour from hamburg with the aidanova was great in itself but unfortunately the hygiene on board was catastrophic under our bed we found dust and lots of things from previous guests such as socks hair ties ear plugs toys chocolate balls etc despite reporting it immediately it was not cleaned only after repeated reports unfortunately this was just one of several disruptions after a nice conversation on board we were asked to submit the report directly to aida which was done the head office seems to have a different opinion especially in terms of cleanliness and the other points as written in an email quoteven if we have different views on the description and assessment of the events described i do not deny that the overall circumstances have upset youquot we were offered compensation in the form of a euro travel voucher well id rather not travel with aida again
the whole package is right from booking to returning home
overall the ports were very beautiful and you could also go on individual excursions
aida luna great ship outstanding staff everyone is super nice and polite whether its with older people or the very young everyone is treated with great care super cleanliness super service big drawback at the port of copenhagen we are pretty annoyed with the bus company hopon hopoff they said the tour lasts hours this is not true it took us hours to get to our desired location with constant changes so there was little time to see the great city euros for two adults and a yearold child taxis are actually much cheaper unfortunately we asked local taxi companies afterwards next time well be wiser unfortunately the nice people who sell these tickets are of course gone by the time you get back to the ship
the team took care of each individual passenger and helped to identify and overcome any problems that arose
unfortunately the ships are becoming too big too many people and confusing
we were completely thrilled and felt incredibly comfortable on board thanks again to the crew
everything on the ship was perfect excursions as always were a bit too expensive for what you get
when a child cancels their cabin days before departure aida makes a lot of money even though no major damage is caused to the child you should probably read the small print i feel like ive been ripped off
that i feel at home on the ship and well looked after and accepted
ship sea entertainment and all this without the phone ringing and without internet
a sea voyage visiting countries in europe is simply unforgettable
probably ok for such a big ship i liked smaller ones better eg the possibility to read in peace or listen to music while looking out to sea
the very best at the beginning of the journey from sending in to cabin minutes it couldnt be better
of ports not called at no alternative offers on board despite announcement by the ships staff
if you cancel your sea voyage you will be charged of the cost of the train journey even though you dont have a booking code and you havent issued a ticket youre not provided any service and youre charged for it dubious business practices so never again aida
once again there were very very nice moments on board aida the whole organization whether excursions buses transfer buses events etc getting off the ship getting on board no waiting times everything was well organized perfect
a great experience it was nautical miles and ports in days the trips out of the ports were always something special
i like the wide range of offers for shore leave although the prices are a bit steep the entertainment on board is good even on days at sea you never get bored not to mention the food on offer everyone will find something they particularly like the service staff seem well motivated
many ports and countries to see in a short time
i dont want to have the feeling of being ripped off all the time a german ship without a german captain thats not possible i want to at least understand him and feel safe in his hands this was not the case on our last cruise with an italian captain who did not speak german and was also barely understandable in english
we are frequent travelers it was our th cruise that we recently took we were on the nova in december we played mini golf on the ship everything was fine but when we were on the cosma we played mini golf again twice unfortunately we only looked at our onboard account after playing for the second time on the nova playing golf was free but on the cosma we paid five euros per mini golf club per game and per club including for our fouryearold son it was not stated anywhere that such high and disproportionate fees were being charged neither at the sports counter where we rented the clubs nor at reception were anyone willing to talk we only got the terse answer thats just the way it is thats clearly a ripoff its a shame aida that you treat your guests like that why dont you communicate it openly you have probably now finally managed to make us no longer travel with you but rather with my ship
friendly staff who enjoy their work clean ship well coordinated route
the ship was actually too big for me
that it is a club ship
too many frail fellow travelers resulting in considerable restrictions for other travelers especially on excursions
update customer service called me about the complaint ive never had such a cheeky woman on the phone she said quotwe can change everything as we want periodquot quotwe dont care what was previously confirmed to you by email periodquot then she hung up the fact that she always says quotperiodquot at the end of the sentence is really sad that customers are treated like this i was practically not insulted for complaining aida is now advertising with false facts we booked the festival cruise on the aidaprima in january we were confirmed by email that there would at least be the light drinks package this was also stated in the terms and conditions when we booked now aida has changed its terms and conditions weeks before the trip and is no longer offering the drinks package that was previously confirmed in writing when asked it was claimed that there was a contingent that had been sold out they checked daily to see if the booking was now online i am in a group with over travel participants most of whom have had the same experience but have heard different excuses sad for a company like this to change the conditions weeks before the trip and after all bookings have been paid for so unfortunately i have to advise against booking with aida as there are breaches of contract who then pays for the rental car hotel parking etc
from booking to departure everything was very well organized the crew membersaida employees on the phone were all friendly and helpful the program on board and the excursions left nothing to be desired we are thrilled
cruises are fundamentally special and cannot be compared to anything else arrive and dont have to do anything
assisted living on the high seas with the aidamar lots of variety on board and in the ports without any annoying flying route hamburgcaribbeanhamburg
we were on the aida stella in the mediterranean from april th to th most of the time we docked in the container ports which means that the port days were extremely loud and the view of containers and cranes from the ship was not really that great the highlight however was barcelona the berth was very far away the berthing costs for aida are probably much cheaper there but they charged a lot for the necessary shuttle bus at euros per person great aida thats how you really make sales but scare away the guests after having even more trouble we will no longer book aida holidays in the future and would rather switch to another cruise company
the overall package i personally prefer to travel on the smaller ships on nova and cosma it is often very loud and hectic
from the booking to the arrival the cruise itself to the departure everything was well organized and to our complete satisfaction
bad service at the onboard reception after a theft in barcelonas metro we were misinformed and treated badly but probably in the belief that we had acted well
great shipping company and travel destinations unfortunately it is getting more and more expensive and the standard is falling
if this is your first time boarding a ship dont go with aida no information in the first day app doesnt work reception wont help much they just take payments very well do everything yourself find offers online yourself make reservations at the max restaurant early because everything is booked find out for yourself where the restaurants and buffets are open book excursions days before departure the excursions with aida are great much better than taking them on land and if youre old this is not for you
scotland over easter with the diva the trip was a socalled selection trip why is unclear though no lectures about the country and its people just excursion sales shows and presentations of other routes edinburgh was cancelled that would have been the highlight of the trip because aida chose a cheap tender port instead of a pier and as expected the north sea is not completely windless at the beginning of april the chance that tendering would not be possible was therefore quite high there was no mention of tenders in the trip description so that borders on deception the excursions have become incredibly expensive for example a mundane twoandahalfhour panoramic trip in a full bus costs euros per person during the whole cruise you felt like you were in a continuous commercial because you were constantly being asked to buy or book something i had never experienced such intrusiveness before unfortunately the quality of the food in the buffet restaurants has also deteriorated considerably the service in the bars is also severely understaffed the waiters try hard but you generally have to get your drinks yourself from now on we will avoid aida
unfortunately it was far too expensive for the service provided the holiday with aida was a complete disaster no opportunities to play or swim anywhere with our little daughter everything costs extra even normal water in summary we are just disappointed and will probably never book with aida again
the reason for skipping the main attraction edinburgh because of the waves should have been resolved not just carried on driving at least the bike tours are overpriced
aarhus is an unrecognized modern city
my trip was absolutely smooth from the start and went as expected my cabin and the ship were exactly as they had been described on the website beforehand so there were no negative surprises overall i am very satisfied with the service i received
a great trip but marred by the unprofessionalism of the tour guide team the onboard shop saleswomen who had no training were not able to accompany the excursions well no communication about the country and the people or the content when we complained that the services were not fully provided we were kept waiting on board for days and then referred to the aida land team many fellow travelers had the same experience we therefore cancelled the excursions we had booked they are not exactly cheap excursions the staff on board were otherwise great everything was clean tidy and always friendly bi
additional day on land
ship trip and service staff were top notch the excursions were extremely problematic due to weather equipment and the organizer
i have traveled with aida about times now i say never again what has happened to you information policy is catastrophic accommodating what is that they are being converted without offering excursions familyfriendly used to be now it is just commercial with no consideration for the guests where has the friendliness and the service gone unfortunately aida was sold off cheaply and you can see that in all areas
for the quotscottish highlightsquot trip over easter aida seriously planned a tender for edinburgh at the beginning of april the weather was naturally a bit windy at the beginning of april thats why edinburgh was cancelled without replacement something always cancels with aida but this time skipping edinburgh on a selection trip because they chose a tender port in the north sea at the beginning of april is quite a feat unfortunately the ship was very full the food wasnt particularly good and the fluff from the first day was still on the carpet on the day of departure it seems that no vacuuming had been done we were very annoyed that was definitely the last aida trip
unfortunately we were disappointed we thought it would be great no information on arrival and the children were very disappointed by incorrect information from reception service staff were sometimes very unfriendly lots of things cost extra some things werent possible because everything was already booked probably because everyone had already reserved everything at home it was probably the first and last time a shame a lot of money wasted
ever larger ships are no guarantee of an ever better vacation more than passengers are simply too many ultimately it is mass processing to optimize costs
the ships are fully booked and the many little things we are missing are no longer important we are a dying breed anyway
on the last trip on the ship i had booked a trip that was intended as a surprise for my wife for her th birthday the friendly employee assured me of absolute discretion as requested unfortunately aida did not keep to this and sent my wife a socalled anticipation email a few days later the reaction to our bitter disappointment began with a letter of explanation and regret for the inconvenience and ended after almost a year of further correspondence with the following compensation luggage tags and bands for the boarding passes which we of course already have after several aida cruises a disgrace for such a faux pas
the organization of the arrival and departure was catastrophic when booking the return flights we were lied to and misled by the staff at reception
the journeyflights were a disaster hardly had internet despite allinclusive trip high extra costs for drinks wifi climbing garden etc
the size of the ship
an incredible trip was planned the travel documents contained incomplete information on entry requirements unfortunately we were not allowed to board the aida ship when we checked in and were then left completely alone because errors with the passport documents were only discovered on site there had been no complaints about entering the country in dubai beforehand aida did not provide any onsite support on the ship or by emergency call by telephone aida leaves you alone in a dramatic travel situation the hotline was no longer reachable after we had initially indicated that it was our own fault this was a catastrophic experience for us which could easily have been supported together with the large aida crew after a hour journey we found ourselves in front of the ship in a terminal alone with two small children the family split up excursions could not take place because aida had not organized the excursions well in advance high and low tide the expensive cabin was an additional disappointment only partially used with restricted visibility and loud background noise a bitter disappointment i have never had a worse experience in my entire life and i felt left alone and uncomfortable for the rest of the trip i recommend that aida work on this so that no other family has to go through this terrible experience
we have already traveled with aida twice and were very satisfied that is why we have now booked another trip which we are already really annoyed about in advance if we adults ie cabins had booked the trip days later we would have received euros onboard credit per cabin when i asked about goodwill i was told that we had booked too early and nothing could be done then there is the thing with the drinks packages that is outrageous since we booked the trip together all of us would have to take the premium all inclusive which then costs a total of euros or other drinks packages although these always have to be the same for both people per cabin when i asked whether my son could book a package with alcoholic drinks and my daughterinlaw who is pregnant a package without alcohol the answer was no the previous alternative the connoisseur package credit card is no longer available either we also went on a cruise with another very wellknown shipping company where you cant book a drinks package because everything is all in they were also much more accommodating when our cabin had to be rebooked they even offered us a higher category for the same price
the priceperformance ratio is no longer right the ship is completely overcrowded people have to queue everywhere wait push their way through and pay extra unfortunately it doesnt give you that holiday feeling even though we have always enjoyed traveling with aida
we spent two wonderful weeks on board the aidasol we were completely satisfied the meals in the buffet restaurants and in the brewery met our expectations the excursions were well organized and accompanied by local guides which meant we saw a lot and learned a lot about the country and its people the crew was concerned about the wellbeing of the guests and always tried to find a quick solution to any problems due to the weather conditions we were unable to sail to honnigsvg and trondheim the costs for the excursions we had booked in advance were refunded without any problems it was possible to book new excursions on board our special thanks go to the captain who together with his crew managed to steer the ship well and safely through the sometimes rough seas despite adverse wind conditions
hello we booked a cruise with aida to the caribbean with everything included including the flight on the way from the baggage carousel to the ship my suitcase was damaged which was also confirmed to me by the reception of the perla when i returned i reported the damage to aida and after submitting all the documents i have not received any information or a refund for more than weeks despite multiple calls and ages on hold
opaque pricing policy and lack of flexibility tip in advance book as late as possible we booked the vario price for the nova then the prices fell sharply by which is of course annoying for loyal bookers so we contacted the hotline to upgrade to a higher cabin category a winwin situation the additional payment according to the vario website would have been eur but we were offered an upgrade for eur this is of course a way of maximizing sales however it does not serve customer satisfaction or the companys image
experience has shown us that we will not travel with the cosma again but with one of the quotsmallerquot ships
the trip was wonderful unfortunately one star is deducted for the threeperson band in the rock box bar it used to be five please bring that back and for the fact that all the pools are overrun with children all day long who simply have no regard for adults please introduce curfews for certain times and areas in the pools i also think its cheeky that the social media flat rate is no longer included in the allinclusive package when prices are really rising significantly everything that wasnt criticized was great
great ship with lots of options aidanova very good
far too little time for shore excursions even though the ship only left hours later internet in the cabin very complicated for people you always have to log off so that your partner can log in etc
the excursions should be better organized if something goes wrong the company should admit it and give a refund which didnt happen we were taken to the wrong camp and so we didnt get anything out of the vacation except for a hour bus ride we also missed the opportunity to experience something important to us if we had booked externally it would have been cheaper all in all very outrageous
aidaprima we wanted to test a quotbiggerquot ship so far we have traveled with a maximum of passengers and will continue to favor the smaller ones in the future but if you are traveling with children aged you will find everything on the prima
we had booked a trip to norway from march and it started with the train strike we booked the journey through aida the day before aida itself said it was none of my business because i could arrive on march without any problems so i took a flixbus and was left with the entire cost its all good you want to remain open even though aida does everything it can not to help you the first stops on the trip went smoothly in alta however we were told in the evening that we were not leaving and would be driving backwards the next morning because of a low pressure system so all the excursions that had already been booked were simply canceled by aida and that was it for them you simply get nothing for not seeing the rest of the trip to the north i mean i paid for it and i dont get anything for it we then anchored in troms for days we arrived at pm in the evening and a makeshift transfer was offered until midnight at the latest after the long unplanned stay in troms the next bad news came the last stop had to be cancelled too and we were being taken somewhere else again no compensation for this during the stage program i was able to see a couple of really good shows but also how the aida stars performed queen tods songs live in front of an audience on the excursion in troms we were scanned and put on the bus when it was about to start we were told that the excursion could not take place in its current form and the alternative route was not possible either but they would come up with something so what do you choose do nothing or at least drive around i asked the travel guide and he said it was normal for this excursion to fall through aida said you would get a small refund for it which two days later still had not been booked when i asked i was told that it was more important to sell excursions at the stops that were not planned i cant really fault the food on the aida sol you can choose from buffet restaurants asian restaurant with a sushi bar where you can have your own plates fried a la carte with no extra charge and a la carte with an extra charge there is the quotsushi all you needquot offer for euros per person which i would not recommend to anyone there is a much smaller menu from which you get one piece whether you like it or not after that you can eat until youre quotfullquot from this smaller menu although you were already half full from stuff you didnt like anyway some of the bars have such stupid opening times that i had to go down two floors to get something to drink why dont they just open all the bars on a sea day in conclusion i can say that aida does everything it can to get their money and have to do as little as possible you really ruined my first cruise for me i would never choose a cruise with such an underground shipping company again
aidacosma is simply too big for us with passengers and a length of m and a width of m you take steps a day we now have another experience under our belt we will remain loyal to our little aidas
great trip the ship waited despite the plane being delayed because of bad weather day was lost but the money was refunded
i think it is more familiar on the smaller ships than on the cosma
a club ship through and through you dont want to leave the ship for fear of missing something on board theres something for everyone
the journey with sun express wasnt particularly special no announcements in german even though there were only aida guests on board
aida and the airline solved problems during the journey in a routine manner suddenly a changed route accepted the inconveniences of the journey were also given a quotconsolation prizequot not exactly aidas strong point
simply great best german cruise provider unfortunately there is still a lot of room to learn from american providers
not again aida cosma we are already full of aida far too many people children on board ship was far too full otherwise ok
a transatlantic journey should be an experience and not feel like a crossing into the shipyard
the crisis management is working excellently due to strikes in germany and storms the information on deck is comprehensive at all times as a passenger you feel very well looked after and safe the crew is careful and helpful
we took a caribbean cruise with the aidaperla from february nd to march th we were actually quite happy with the trip but the end was a disaster on march th aida informed us that there were no more flights from frankfurt to vienna on march th strike and that we would get euros back per person and that we would have to look into and organize the trip home ourselves at reception they said we should take a taxi from frankfurt to vienna unbelievable right then i had to argue so that i could at least get internet access for hours but they didnt even want to give us that for free the stupid thing was that they simply canceled our flights of their own accord and we didnt actually find out until march th at the airport thats why we couldnt rebook with austrian airlines because we were no longer in the system we were completely let down by aida we booked the third flight ourselves that day we flew again at pm the previous flights were of course already fully booked we paid euros for the flights to vienna which aida does not want to pay regardless of whether i paid for a package holiday with aida for euros it would have been so easy if aida had not canceled our flights on its own initiative because then the airline would have automatically rebooked us i have now handed everything over to the lawyer and he will sue for the costs never again aida they just let you down despite the package holiday
annett and the whole show team in front of and behind the stage were great the digital tendering wasnt well organized either the shore leave in england was a disaster we stood in the aisle for over minutes close together with other people
security has an inferiority complex and unfortunately considering the number of passengers there are not enough service staff
very nice moments unfortunately not as it once was the little ships are all gone
i dont think its right and you get the impression that aida often tries to get money out of their guests with a trip price of over they shouldnt charge per person for showering on the last day before departure thats cheeky and customers have to shower before the flight aida knows that and takes advantage of it departures are easily and if half of them just shower everyone knows what theyre earning thats a ripoff
service has deteriorated significantly in all areas a full ship may be good for the operating result but it does not create holiday enjoyment
interesting travel routes ships depending on the year of construction topnotch or old expensive excursions the supposed price advantage over other providers no longer exists
everything works wonderfully from the arrival to the luxury on the ship to the departure top
very good advance information as well as the itinerary and the information on the ship were decisive for the good rating
overwhelmed by the size of the ship
the fellow travelers stood out due to their sometimes very low standards
from booking to the trip we were well looked after only the return journey during the lufthansa and gdl strike could have been better supported
unfortunately the departure was a bit chaotic the onboard internet was down very often this meant that the social media flat rate was hardly usable its not worth the money it costs the reception is hardly any help
long waiting times at the reception as people for passengers
we are big aids fans however the last trip was a total disaster i have never seen such an overcrowded ship it was a complete mass processing no space in restaurants bars the pool lounge areas shows kids club in addition the hygiene standards were completely inadequate this time and we had a terrible stomach and intestinal outbreak on board we got it too and unfortunately there was no way to get to a doctor the ports were absolutely unspectacular the cities that were advertised such as london and paris were hours away by car there was still a traffic jam though so there was no time to see anything at all in england everyone on the ship had to go to the authorities and show their id whether they were going ashore or not waiting time at least minutes you hardly have any time to go ashore
we were on the nova this ship is a floating kindergarten and is developing more and more into a ballermann
the lt front officer knew that the sewer in our cabin at sea had been stinking since nevertheless the cabin is rented out without any indication of impairment
never again aida cosma the ship is a complete failure customer service is also nonexistent
the trip on the aidastella was my first cruise apart from a few minor things bus transfer in agadir it was a very nice trip with a lot of luxury however if i were to book again i would make sure to book either days or days to avoid unnecessary days at sea in my opinion days at sea are only used to avoid berthing costs in the ports but are not necessary in terms of time
unfortunately you can see that its all about profit and not customer satisfaction it starts with seat reservations on the plane aida has put a stop to the airlines practice of only booking seats through myaida and not booking them separately with the airlines a normal seat in economy class costs nothing with most airlines with aida it costs between and a seat with more legroom costs between with aida depending on the flight route what does the flight route have to do with the different prices we were also affected by the strike and suggested to aida that they please rebook us at another airport so that we could still arrive on the actual day according to aida however this was not possible but according to the airline it was but they were not allowed to act because aida has to manage it as we were booked through a group booking there was a few euros on board credit for the lost day on site but this was a more than ridiculous amount for me this was the first and last trip with aida
we booked seats with more legroom directly with aida for the outbound and return flights there were no seats with more legroom on either the outbound or return flights eurowings had swapped planes we didnt get any money back from aida we had the additional seats we had booked they werent responsible for anything else unbelievable aida profits from its guests if you book seats with more legroom you should definitely make sure that the invoice for this additional service clearly states that you have booked seats with more legroom and not just quotseat reservationquot like it did with us never again aida
missing usp and no longer the product it was the new large ships offer everything but are very impersonal it should be mentioned that the ship is very popular with families with children all year round the prices for drinks and extras are significantly overpriced compared to what aida has to spend on them personnelpurchasestaxes the same goes for the excursions these are often significantly cheaper on getyourguide or similar portals unfortunately the documentary from the zdf media library fits very well it was a top product but is no longer my thing sucking money from every corner but unfortunately no development in quality and performance this expressly does not apply to the crew and staff who were great and tried hard
a lot of effort was put into the travelers our expectations for our first sea voyage were met or even exceeded
a visa for great britain is missing for the trip this is only briefly mentioned in one of the emails you get a mountain of emails from this provider before the trip the aim of which is to generate sales we then stood at checkin without the necessary visa we simply didnt know that we needed it and were sent home we were promised a travel voucher on the spot apparently the same mishap happened to many other travelers and they were also sent home the following working day the hotline no longer wanted to know anything about a travel voucher saying that all the money was gone the case was already sent to my law firm today i can only warn everyone to be careful with the visa the organizer only gives marginal information about this anyone who misses the visa will lose all their money never again aida
i hadnt expected that the aidadiva would come so close to my experiences with more expensive sea voyages in many respects the size of the ship the ambience and the service were almost ideal shore excursions on the other hand were often unsatisfactory i had better experiences and higher expectations in this regard except for the golf day
most important tip make sure you take enough foreign currency in our case us dollars on board the exchange rates on board are a ripoff at a rate of us dollars gt eur aida charged us dollars gt eur in addition to the already hefty surcharges we have never received less us dollars than euros but here we did unfortunately we had to exchange them on board because the various atms on our route only gave out local currency otherwise aida is expensive everything costs money which is often offered free of charge by other shipping companies eg spasauna area or other activities such as folding towels etc shore excursions are also overpriced definitely do them on your own there are always people with whom you can share the cost of taxisbuses
top trip top ship and top service
overpriced far too short layover times in most ports zero flexibility drinks package policy included drinks of inferior quality both beer wine and coffee overpriced excursions of too short duration
although there were over children on board everything went smoothly the ship is very well divided into areas there was therefore no concentration of guests that made me feel anxious as a walker user
great ship great crew very diverse offerings on the ship would go back on this or a similarly sized ship anytime
first trip on the aida nova for us the ship was too big and there were too many people on board so we prefer smaller ships
was skeptical about going on such a big ship but was pleasantly surprised
the ports were good everything is still affordable simply a good experience
we took the blue aida that toured the seychelles mauritius reunion and madagascar right from the start they specify that the cruise is designed primarily for a german audience so all activities and shows are in german ok for a ship that flies the italian flag and pays taxes in italy its quite strange but we decide to accept it and book its a shame however that everything was really taken to the extreme because we can understand activities and shows but not be able to understand what were eating due to the absence of an english menu or labels at the buffet rather than the paper program they leave in your room it could be written in english at least for nongerman passengers but no not even the application provided the possibility of changing languages you almost get the impression that other nationalities on board dont want them if all this can still be in some way acceptable the very serious thing but truly serious is that during the journey the captain of the ship decided to change the itinerary and leave one day earlier than expected from that nation la reunion because bad weather was forecast to communicate this to the passengers an announcement was simply made obviously in german by the speaker which even if i had been german i might not have heard it if perhaps i was in the room taking a shower or in the gym with headphones rather than at the wellness center having a sauna no paper communications in the room not even in german moral of the story we seriously risked staying on the island some of us without even having our passports with us only chance meant it didnt go this way when we complained about this at reception the response we received was quotwere sorry we know we have this defectquot well try to do something to resolve it because its very serious from my point of view shows and activities are few and not of excellent quality food for us italians is not very good nothing to do with the other companies another big flaw is access to drinking water we had the all inclusive drinks package paying per room we only had glasses of water included if you wanted the bottle to take to your room you had to pay for it madness even spirits were not included in the package and i honestly dont remember it being specified on the other hand they had excellent beer
travel preparation i was registered under two customer numbers my first call to aida took about minutes i explained my problem to a nice lady and asked her to merge the duplicate entries including club membership she promised me this unfortunately nothing happened further calls to aida failed because no one answered the phone after waiting in line for about minutes each time i gave up the menu navigation on the aida website is a disgrace im a programmer myself something like this would never have passed the qs at the companies i work for arrival was ok life on board was ok sometimes long waiting times at the bars but it was still ok the island of la gomera was not visited for safety reasons i can understand that but it was still annoying massages that had been booked in advance were rebooked without us being informed including for a different time we had an appointment for pm we went to our room at pm to change at pm we got a call we were told we had an appointment at pm then we were blamed for not looking at the board portal the new appointment was listed there we should have called in beforehand the spa manager who was called in was also rude and blamed us sorry whats up with that we had written confirmation it did say that we should contact them in advance for a consultation but why do i need a consultation in advance and i would have expected information in the form of a letter about rescheduling an appointment in principle the information about rescheduling via the portal would have been ok but nobody told us what the board portal was for when i first looked in i only saw advertising i dont need that on vacation the reception was not aidalike at all no welcome cocktail like there used to be hardly any other information either poor service apart from the prebooked appointments for people each we actually wanted to treat ourselves to a massage every day well we didnt feel like it anymore and cancelled all the appointments the long queues for a cappuccino at breakfast when the planes werent out of service were extremely annoying there were also a lot of families with small children on board all you could hear was the children screaming everywhere it wasnt exactly relaxing either the departure was a disaster the plane was an hour late but thats not aidas fault then we had to wait another hour because the passenger for one of our suitcases wasnt with us and after landing we had to wait another hours for our luggage because there were apparently not enough staff there was no one to talk to in the end planes were waiting for their luggage there were tons of complaints and angry passengers a member of staff told me in private that condor apparently doesnt pay the service provider well and that other airlines are preferred thats just not acceptable in the end it was hours late well the lawyer has something to do again these were too many negative experiences at once for my taste aida is therefore no longer an option for me the next ship will probably be quotmein schiffquot
the ship was good the foreign crew made a lot of effort the excursions were not so well planned hectic with little time to enjoy the special places
arrival and departure not possible despite paying for seat reservations excursions did not take place or did not take place as booked chaos at reception when there are complaints quottheres nothing they can doquot is no help they didnt try very hard either service staff were very friendly everywhere though but for the price never again with aida priceperformance ratio just doesnt match
very friendly staff in every area we felt very comfortable on deck unfortunately all the excursions were in english only one excursion had a germanspeaking tour guide on board
the accessibility of the ship which also gives people with disabilities the opportunity to experience beautiful moments but also the achievements of each individual member of the entire crew
i cant complain it was good maybe show a bit more of the ship
after two great cruises in and i am now very disappointed it is as the previous speakers have written the prices are rising and the quality is falling the quality of the food has dropped considerably and i eat a lot but somehow it doesnt taste good the program is always the same x queen in days of cruising x abba and the same ballermann playlist every evening the same performances on every trip i was really bored on board the loungers are reserved the courses are fully booked as are the excursions if you can book one they were great more and more often ports are not called at at short notice for reasons such as weather or similar ive had this happen several times and i wonder if the system works does this save you the berthing fees i am really very disappointed after i traveled from antalya to the seychelles in november and have now been to the canary islands the staff are super nice and friendly what really annoys me however is that solo travelers are apparently not welcome although we pay for people and only eat for one trips are increasingly no longer bookable for one person alone what should you do if you live without a partner and still want to go on holiday i think its completely ok to pay a surcharge but paying twice as much or more than someone who is travelling with a child is really not ok almost discriminatory
overall a very good holiday except that one port was cancelled
everything was great but there was a discrepancy when booking a cycling trip similar tours in terms of the number of kilometers but a price difference of almost euros per person
describe the walking routes on the ship each individual deck
arrival and departure are well organized only the train service doesnt work
the customercustomer satisfaction is the focus at aida the aida shore excursions and the stay on board were to our complete satisfaction the only criticism was the mass processing at passport control in the port of dubai when reentering dubai with the aida people on shore excursions should go through passport control in advance so that delays are not caused the passengers who remain on board we had a few in the long queue should go through passport control at a later time some of the shore excursionists felt that this was a mistake in aidas coordination
in some ports we booked several excursions the quality varied greatly which leads to an average rating however a very positive and a very negative rating would be correct
i made a sea voyage for the first time and was very surprised and would like to do it again
it was the last big trip with my husband we are both over my husband is in a wheelchair we booked it through a travel agency that specializes in wheelchair travel runareisen medical documents were submitted a severely disabled persons pass and it was pointed out that my husband can only walk a few steps i was assured that we would be met at the airport taken through customs and accompanied to our seats we would be the first to board the plane it was all a lie i had to get help myself in munich despite the priority sign on the wheelchair we were the last to board the plane and had a seat in the back third of the plane for my husband that meant crawling from chair to chair there are people sitting everywhere who feel harassed as soon as you touch them it took almost minutes to get to our seats my husband was completely exhausted sweaty and just wanted to go home in frankfurt it was even worse we were afraid we would miss the plane because no one was coming to guide us through the huge airport at the last second we reached our destination at the last minute running at the very back again again the exhausting struggle from seat to seat we felt like second class passengers but the crowning glory was arriving in barbados as usual we were the last to get off the plane the cabin crew had already left we were supposed to be picked up by the aida crew who also accompanied all the other passengers to the ship in the pitchblack airport area there was only the ground staff who pushed us into a taxi i hardly speak any english have no idea what the lady was telling me and where the taxi was taking us it felt like we were on a onehour tour of the island until the aida prima finally showed up our wheelchair was still on the plane so we had to wait again until one of the ships staff brought a wheelchair the crew knew that we were coming in a wheelchair so why is nobody absolutely nobody prepared for this the excursions continued i had already booked several beach trips at home and a walking tour of the city well if only the excursion description had also stated that instead of buses there were only vans in which a wheelchair would not fit we were only able to go on excursions the rest we spent in the cabin with a view of the grey walls of the various ports are we paying more than euros for that to at least make the return flight less stressful i asked at reception for seats in the front third of the plane no luck instead of row like on the outbound flight we had row so the drudgery all over again and that even though aida advertises wheelchair trips we didnt see any of the islands and on christmas eve we didnt even get anything for dinner the buffet restaurants were full even after an hour and the other restaurants only accept advance bookings which we didnt know last but not least we took off three hours late of course the last ones on the plane and the last ones off at least a replacement flight was available which we managed to catch with great difficulty but our luggage wasnt there at the counter there was a man who only spoke english who immediately pointed out that lost luggage can only be reported online aida cant do anything about the stress and difficulties at the airports they are only responsible from the time you board the ship and the same applies to disembarkation the airline cant do anything about that either the airports are responsible for that and they in turn have staff shortages whether its illness holidays or something else i paid for a service that i didnt get but which was suggested by both the travel agency and aida the only nice thing on board was the balcony cabin and a bright spot was the really friendly staff both in the room cleaning and in the restaurant conclusion never again
first cruise expectations exceeded
the onboard bill is incorrect but without insight also because communication at reception does not work as neither the receptionist nor the customer communicate in their native language german is of little help here the photo service is catastrophic costs for iris pictures and at the end you have a stick with the wrong names incorrect data and the uncertainty as to whether it is really your own eyes and then there is the confusion between father and son because they have the same first name aida is completely confused in the digital world and fails across the board failing to separate the boarding passes properly in a weeks vacation poor performance here too a major problem no german at reception
everything is great above all the staff on board are the best entertainment activities service friendliness competence interest and appreciation are outstanding everyone does their best unfortunately it is clear that from year to year fewer and fewer employees are working on board and solving problems without sufficient support from rostock likewise communication with competent customer service outside the ships is becoming increasingly limited and the hurdles such as accessibility competence and loss of time as well as missing email replies are considerable but also certainly intentional the management obviously makes a lot of mistakes but that can get better at some point ill stay tuned
the shipping route in the indian ocean is varied and eventful
unfortunately the service ends on the return journey even though a rail amp fly package is included due to a rail strike not a single train ran on the entire day of the return journey we had already obtained permission the day before both at the reception on the ship and by phone from aida to travel home using alternative means of transport and to have the costs reimbursed after submitting the receipts to aida customer service we received no response for weeks only after we asked again was the reimbursement of costs refused we were told to contact db they responded that we should contact the tour operator after another contact email we received another rejection no concessions whatsoever or the offer of a travel voucher several inquiries about the official complaint procedure remained unanswered we are now sending a letter of complaint by post to the management
priceperformance top always striving to maintain the ship constantly striving to make the holidaymakers feel comfortable with success
the information about the trip was incomplete was not mentioned beforehand or was not clear we had to land at a different airport and were driven km to the port x tendering in the ports takes up an immense amount of free time not enough berths on days at sea unfriendly staff at reception it felt as if many people here did not enjoy this trip very much
the trip itself was nice what is really unacceptable however is the fact that aida charges eur per seat and person for seat reservations on the plane for us adults and children and thats eur extra on the outbound flight we were quotluckyquot and all sat next to each other but on the return flight from dubai we all got different seats in different rows if the cabin crew hadnt reacted my yearold daughter would have been sitting alone somewhere among strangers
unfortunately it is becoming more and more a massprocessing business the flair of the cruise is being neglected
our th cruise this time again to the orient we had a veranda comfort deluxe with lounge cabin on deck as we always book the vario tariff we were unfortunately a bit quotunluckyquot with the cabin this time which was between two infinity pools it was sometimes a bit louder the view was therefore also restricted we always had breakfast in east which was not as full as the other two restaurants unfortunately markt and bella donna were always full in the evening that was sometimes annoying but to be expected on a sea day i recommend booking paid restaurants we really enjoyed the trip but you can tell that the service is declining that was different on the other cruises the staff were always friendly no matter what area they were in however the service staffs german skills should still be constantly improved we can communicate well in english but that is not the case for all guests or children aida prima is simply a huge ship that was almost fully occupied next time we would prefer a smaller ship in the fleet
aidanova with lng propulsion a step in the right direction please continue to convert the fleet
we took a trip to the canary islands with the aidacosma to be on the safe side we also booked the flights and transfers to the airport on gran canaria through aida we have now been sitting at the airport for hours a new flight is due to depart tomorrow morning no question there can always be problems but as a package tour provider it is aida who should now inform us after calls to the emergency hotline we were told that eurowings was responsible not aida we should now find a hotel ourselves by tomorrow on a popular holiday island in the middle of carnival great performance shifting the responsibility and leaving your guests who paid a lot more money for the flights stranded at the airport without luggage etc with quotcontact your airlinequot i will never travel by flight with aida again
it can offer the more expensive excursions in german
aida has taken the system of compensating supposedly low travel prices with exclusive services in order to generate additional profit to the extreme
a trip on the cosma was the worst experience of my life the managers on board are beyond arrogant you pay so much money and get nothing out of your vacation it would take hours to write down everything negative aida offered me a refund which i politely declined
madagascar unreasonable feb ill say right away that i am not turning a blind eye to the misery in this world but offering us an island as a destination where the plague was still raging about months ago is beyond words the fact that the misery of the people and animals is completely tangible and unbearable is bad enough but dumping it on us is bordering on tactless on aidas part then making us fill out forms saying what we thought of the excursion shows me that in my opinion aida operates from behind a desk i cant imagine that anyone from aida went on this excursion to see if they could offer it if that were the case then all i can say is that aida knew how to upset people of course we rated the forms as quotgoodquot we didnt want to cause the locals any more unjustified trouble aida managed to make me want to go home aida also managed to make me feel like i was constantly being ripped off we knew that the aida blue was an older ship but we didnt expect to be really shocked by the condition of the suite never again aida unless youve booked a drinks package and drink your way to a better life kind regards annett schindler suite aida blue
excursions not only overpriced but also poor quality
access to different ports canary islands and morocco
booking unfortunately i can only judge the booking process the hourslong wait on the hotline and the customer service as my trip was cancelled by aida on the same day as the booking i booked in the morning and paid immediately by credit card the debit was displayed in my visa app and i received a payment confirmation email from aida then in the afternoon i got a shock i received an email informing me that the trip had been cancelled due to lack of payment after contacting my credit card company by phone i was assured that everything had gone correctly on their part and they even gave me the payment authentication code the aida hotline is extremely difficult to reach and after an hour on hold i was told that the cabin had probably been booked by two people at the same time or that there was a bug in the system i was offered the junior suite for an additional charge of over which i politely declined due to our budget i was told to call again later in the evening there might still be cancellation cabins our trip was booked last minute in the evening i received the same information again that i had not paid and that only the junior suite was available so i resigned myself to staying at home the next day another email said that the cancellation had been initiated by me and that the amount paid would be refunded to me free of charge i then contacted my credit card company again and was again confirmed that the payment had been debited long story short i have now received the amount refunded after a week but am currently losing around due to the exchange rate i am now hoping for goodwill from visa aida offered me an onboard credit of today for the next trip as compensation after all this hassle and frustration i will certainly not book another trip and therefore cannot recommend the shipping company to anyone
indian ocean top route recommended
so it was our first time on the aidacosma and it was a dream i think you hardly notice that the ship is so full everything just gets lost its a dream ship
i booked a trip with my family in with travel cancellation insurance the trip was canceled due to the current situation in the mediterranean the deposit for the travel cancellation insurance was not refunded with reference to a claim for reimbursement from the insurer of course hanse merkur refused to refund now aida says offset against a new travel booking with a deadline for rebooking does aida really need it ive lost the desire to travel with aida
warning never again aida we booked days on aida luna in a balcony cabin in the caribbean the balcony just under extra charge was in a terrible state when we arrived there was paint missing everywhere many places were rusty the room was also not cleaned properly when we arrived hair on the bed and in the bathroom smeared windows remnants of previous holidaymakers hammock full of rubble dust and paint residue after complaining to reception for the first time on the day of arrival and asking for another cabin we were told that they were fully booked and that the ship was old when i said that we are actually meinschiff customers and have always been satisfied there we were told quotwe are aida and not tui so you will just have to go back to meinschiffquot and after three days they suddenly started building work on the balcony it was not possible to use it during that time we had in total days with a building site outside the door until i finally lost my temper and insisted that the construction work be stopped noise pollution from sanding work with the flexibility a tapedoff balcony dust dirt and a strong smell of paint in the cabin thats what you imagine a relaxing holiday to be the internet package for euros is too expensive considering that the connection was poor on several days the ship is very old overall on days we couldnt shower because the hot water was turned off on the whole ship due to different burst water pipes overall aida is lagging far behind meinschiff tui is a completely different ball game the buffets seem to be the big hit for pensioners and the many guests from the new federal states but anyone who has certain expectations of their vacation doesnt want to be fobbed off with this canteen food our construction site complaint was acknowledged by aida with euros onboard credit for a travel price of euros and a bottle of champagne we sent it back great since no one at reception wanted or was able to help us for days we forwarded our meticulously documented pictures and videos to an rtl consumer magazine which will broadcast the grievances from aprilmay in the coming days all of the documented grievances will be available in advance in a comprehensive video on my youtube channel i hope you and aida have fun with it we advise everyone against a holiday on aida luna which is a shame because we were actually quite happy on the perla but for us and other guests it was a horror trip that you would have expected in developing countries in future we will only book meinschiff
poor organization when tendering by ferry from the town hours of waiting in the hallway and stairwell no information when guests can tender without excursions organized by aida on the cayman islands tendering with aida boats also hardly any information
aida has to put the customers as most important and not the investors of carnival cruises like vanguard blackrock and so on due the negative experiences ive decided that after cruises in the last years this has been my last one
tour operator only ranked th out of travel provider only st out of that is more than bad what is the reason for that the customer service which unfortunately is nonexistent when a complaint is made aida always takes it to court even though there are clear laws for package tours route changes etc that is why aida does not take part in any arbitration proceedings beautiful ships but extremely poor customer service this cruise provider is therefore no longer an option for us
the aida nova is a great ship and if there are any problems they are solved i would go again anytime
it was great that the layover time in the ports was very long finding your way around the ship was very difficult there were too few or too late information signs i would like to see better announcements of the activities and more of them on sea days i would like a pool for adults clean chairs in the buffet restaurants too and checks for appropriate clothing long trousers and no flipflops
a little disappointed on january th aida finally cancelled the quotsuez canalred seaquot transvoyages due to the events and are offering new bookingsrebookings with voucherspromotions from january th but all guests who had already assessed this terrible situation as unacceptable for themselves days beforehand and did not want to travel through the suez canalred sea will unfortunately not receive a voucher from aida because they were too early with their rebooking customersguests are treated so differently herethats what we were unfortunately toldafter we asked on the website under current information it says all guestsbut apparently the customers who rebook earlier are no longer all guests
the evaluation is a bit too strenuous for me as i cant assign the ports to the islands i would have to look everything up including when i did the excursions with aida
my suitcase story continues aida rejected my complaint with the friendly comment that i did not report the damage immediately on board that is not true i reported the damage to an aida employee in the port terminal in the presence of witnesses and showed the damaged suitcase this employee told me to write to aida i specifically asked if i could go back on board to report the damage to reception here i would have had to take the full suitcase back on board as no one from reception would have come outside with me i was denied access to the ship so how could i have pushed my way past security with a heavy suitcase if an aida employee gives me information then i have to assume that he is telling the truth i am now to be punished for an errorthe employees incompetence the hamburg consumer advice center has also confirmed my view in addition to compensation new equivalent suitcase of the same brand i would also be entitled to damages the injured guest must not suffer any disadvantage for incorrect information my legal protection insurer has also confirmed that a suitcase damaged by an employee of the shipping company must be replaced by the shipping company this is not how you treat loyal customers who have already made more than trips with aida for me there will never be another quotsee you on aidaquot in the future
we were with adults and children and years old from january st to february th on the canary islands route on the cosma unfortunately the mini club was only available for parentchild time for of the hours available the rest of the time was for settling in and supervision during the first hours and pm the children are usually asleep so the time is lost and there is only pm left you book a cruise to entertain small children but if you dont want to or cant put your child in daycare you have a huge problem if no children were in daycare at the time you were allowed in but had to leave again as soon as just one child had been registered for daycare its a big room and all the children had to leave frequently because only one child was being looked after there were other rooms where it could have been looked after but all the small children were punished there its a disgrace avoid this ship it varies from ship to ship with small children if you dont want to give them to someone to look after them
always good after several cruises it still feels like coming home we are very reassured that safety is always a top priority like now because of the storm in norway
we found the ship very full despite everything we were completely satisfied very nice staff and service very well organized even if you dont dock at a port because of a storm the aida team has everything under control
the excursions are too expensive considering what they offer
getting to know the ship cosma
we traveled with aida twice before corona and were actually satisfied now we are considering another trip and i am actually disappointed even before we leave everything is getting more expensive and the service leaves a lot to be desired i was very disappointed with the way the customer service dealt with it and the tone thats it aida you have successfully gotten rid of us as customers unfortunately i have a different idea of service taking days to answer an email is not service for me either with kind regards
relaxation is not possible on such large ships
it was our fourth cruise with aida x nova x cosma we are always impressed the service is simply first class no matter who you speak to you get help straight away both ships are great
a week in the canaries with madeira in the first two ports we were able to rent a scooter within walking distance without any problems and had more or less enough time to explore the island unfortunately the opposite was the case on la palma and lanzarote the service on board was great but you have to pay extra for everything
aidanova or similar ships of this size are recommended for families with small children i cannot recommend it for middleaged guests who want to relax and enjoy a safe holiday experience on smaller ships has taught us better reservations and staff were sometimes not available at all nobody can do anything about bad weather and the resulting cancellations but we think it is outrageous to then charge for transfers aidanova never ever
we will not book this big ship again we left early on friday it was just too much for us
zero stars because it was not possible to travel daughter and granddaughter got to dubai with the childs passport but it was over on the aida because it was still valid but not the latest version strange the airport and immigration authorities in dubai did not care on the ship they were immediately informed that since the trip had not been started the return flight would also be cancelled how crazy is that you cant make money any faster in my opinion the german hotline is also a total failure oh well the relatives can take care of it from germany off to the taxi and goodbye scary families are also separated one parent with child on board the other parent with child turned away never again inhumane in my opinion
it would be nice if it was taken into account that there are many dutch people on board and not just germans that people are coming on board in different places and not just in las palmas
poor organization of the tender boats and information about changes was given too late i found the trip stressful
i am really stunned verdi is on strike and aida after it was known for more than a day is canceling the entire trip on the perla in the caribbean on february st no possibility of outbound flights on your own initiative from amaterdam or better to leave cabins empty with the exception of two flights all flights were brought forward or relocated to other airports force majeure or not the fact that aida had no options to relocate them however with the flight arriving the next day is very sad a company like that should be welltested in terms of strikes and find a solution for all scenarios months of anticipation for nothing thank you aida the travel agency i booked with was also speechless and had never expected something like this before layover times in port are extended loyal customers are scared away no comparable trips will be offered in the near future at the same or relatively comparable conditions the individual person there are certainly many who feel and think the same as me is no longer of interest thanks aida for nothing
catastrophic communication from the ships management
good ports very friendly staff successful trip
once a ship always a ship
the last trip was to asia which was also the last trip for us the excursions consisted purely of bus rides over km on motorways and country roads booked services were almost never available always terrible alternatives bad hygiene half the ship had either corona diarrhea or bronchitis terrible vacation
the ship was too big for me personally i had better experiences with your smaller ships
gigantic ship in the sense that you get lost quickly the electronic information boards dont really help its good if you benefit from other cruises the crowd is so low these days that you sometimes feel like youre in a prefab housing project please dont get me wrong but a cruise with aida is no longer anything special and thats also what the crowd is made up of
the cruise was very nice and relaxing the crew was friendly overall you really should give it a top rating stars however the shipping companys handling of the announced rail strikes was less than pleasing anyone who had booked a package holiday with a rail amp fly package was not informed of their rights and it was left unclear how you could get a partial refund for at least the train ticket if the train was cancelled the reception on the ship referred you to the db which is incorrect the shipping company has unfortunately lost trust with this approach
a very great route with a beautiful ship i can only recommend this route to everyone
great route planning appreciative treatment of the onboard staff almost unconditionally friendly staff
when checking in luggage in hamburg you have to queue outside for a while even in subzero temperatures not nice for families with small children and older people it is not explained that not every family member has to queue it took four hours for the luggage to arrive in front of the cabins we were already wondering whether it had been lost the safety briefing could not be played on the tv in the cabin and had to be done on a cell phone for the safety drill you had to go to another deck to present your boarding pass in an emergency follow the signs and take the shortest route i was rudely asked to leave the crew area when i took the wrong staircase these were open because of the luggage distribution and quotcrew onlyquot was not visible in an emergency it doesnt matter i have to adjust my daily schedule in order to pick up a qr code from the elevator on deck at a fixed time so that i can get out of the parking lot in hamburg but when you enter your license plate is scanned and the barrier opens automatically appointments while on vacation are the last straw above all for all those who have paid a lot of money for parking there are only two time slots in which you can get the qr code and then you dont even need it when you leave the restaurants have impossible opening hours when youre on vacation it can get later at pm the dishes are cleared away and the car is vacuumed it doesnt matter that youve not finished eating the wifi rarely works and keeps dropping out even though they charge over for premium its free in every mcdonalds at aida youre guaranteed to pay a lot elevators were temporarily out of service no announcements wheelchair users and families with strollers waited in the stairwells floors by stairs several times an endless number of small children no ban on strollers in the elevators parents dont reprimand their children children even sit at the slot machines in the casino shops on the ship are closed when shore leave is possible if you stay on the ship because you are ill you have no chance of getting anything long delay in departure from hamburg when it is already getting late you would like to be able to eat something the restaurants are closed from pm staggered opening times could help name tags with language flags would be good you never know whether you have to speak english or german often communication only works with hands and feet there is no search function for things on board for example where are the stores you always have to flick through each deck and search endless numbers of emails that you eventually lose track of in general it is difficult to find your way around the booking system one day the heating in the cabin did not work there was no response from reception as to when the problem would be remedied it was c in the cabin only when we asked was it confirmed that several cabins were affected and that the staff were working on solving the problem the next day we were told that the heating was working again but it was working again in the evening in the case of a medical emergency the patient is asked to go to the infirmary if they are not fit to be transported they explain that picking them up in a wheelchair is expensive they then accept it anyway and wait hours if they have a stroke there is nothing that can be done only after they threatened consequences and reported it to reception did the medical service take action the staff in the hospital were very unfriendly documents and medical records were not issued it was inevitably food poisoning on board nothing else was an option the security checks at the destinations are lax and even when the detectors are triggered they are not always followed up so why have checks at all an electronic device was taken from me at the checkpoint after going ashore apparently electronic devices are not allowed on board what i was allowed to pick it up at the terminal when i left total traffic jam when i left despite having my own suitcase because i couldnt get past the people who were collecting their suitcases from the terminal total chaos why not two exits
far too long distances if your cabin is in the front of the ship which is also above the outdoor fitness area which becomes a childrens playground at night and you have to listen to the moaning and screaming of the people exercising all day long far too few elevators for the size of the ship especially if you are traveling with a walker i had to wait up to minutes to get into an elevator and then had to drag myself down decks of stairs with the walker consideration for other passengers is almost nonexistent other shipping companies have a much better clientele the booking process itself was a disaster
very nice ship here the perla most of the ports on the route caribbean islands were ok the food was very good as was the service housekeeping and entertainment our cabin which we had chosen before booking met all expectations was quiet and well equipped service in the caribbean means that you dont have to worry about your suitcases they are brought to the ship or the plane checkin and checkout were well organized and took place directly at the cruise terminal one star is deducted for the partially not all lack of motivation of the scouts directly from aida they mostly acted listlessly and unmotivated i was also very annoyed by the sometimes far too high prices of the excursions eg a little train ride through grenada cost euros with aida the little train left directly in front of the terminal anyone could get on there price ie i paid euros for the accompanied walk of around m
very good staff friendly employees and a very good lecturer who was able to give you very good instructions about the country in question before each shore excursion all in all a satisfied customer
in my opinion the standard and service on aida has deteriorated significantly everyone can be happy as they wish but decency and respect would be desirable i have been sailing for years but the service from the staff is no longer as friendly and customeroriented as it once was
if you have questions before your trip the company is difficult to reach
respond to travelers reports and resolve problems
the caribbean vacation on the ship including shore excursions was very nice the aida crew and the service on board were top notch aida did everything right but access to the internet on board via wifi is a disaster due to the extremely poor wifi implementation the expensive internet package cannot be used properly anyone who has to work remotely from on board from time to time has a problem flying with aidas flight service provider condor borders on physical assault due to the far too small seat spacing on longhaul flights in addition aida charges a euro seat reservation fee per flight in our opinion this is outrageous as there is no service behind it lots of suitcases get broken on condor for us it was one suitcase for our friends suitcases and when we arrived at the baggage carousel in dsseldorf the whole drama was revealed with even more broken suitcases
we only book the cabins and thus ser
the first sea voyage and all expectations were fulfilled the price was certainly a bit high but in line with the offer

unfortunately we can no longer recommend it we are currently still on board aida prima what we are experiencing here is abysmal we have often traveled with aida but we have rarely experienced such unfriendly staff the reception does not help at all with problems you always just hear that it is not possible we mistyped the internet flat rate in aidas tariff jungle and booked the wrong flat rate we were told that it was their own fault thank you in the restaurants you wait forever for refills there are always ice bowls or plates missing our veranda cabin is directly above a public smoking area a no go the evening program is super bad and boring you have to pay for everything even for the sauna the prices on board have risen dramatically in for really bad excursions you pay twice as much per person as before the clientele is a habit to get rid of aida should go back to its old standards we took our first trip in when it was still a vacation we have just been on board for days and still have days to go normally a positive effect but we will be glad when it is over and aida will never see us again thanks for nothing in the future we will travel with mein schiff again we always had a perfect vacation and service there
i booked an aida cruise through a travel agency and wanted to change my cabin because a travel agency only provides the cabin category i contacted the customer service of the aida shipping company after waiting for about minutes they told me over the phone that they were not responsible for this quotthe travel agency always does thatquot who else apart from the shipping company is responsible for cabin occupancy how incompetent and inflexible can aida customer service be should i refrain from making a future booking
you feel comfortable on the ship get help when necessary and problems are solved relatively quickly
app is confusing not enough information received incorrect erroneously sent cabin mail received some ships are run down and have only been moderately repaired
the ship offers a good all round service
it is and was always great on your ship i personally prefer the smaller ones like the sol or blu
the advice when booking is very good the overall concept at aida is right everything fits together on the large and small ships
despite the high basic travel price there are high additional costs for things that are expected to be taken for granted
the service has suffered extremely and the aida excursions are highly overpriced
the nautical miles from previous years will be deleted the aida app on board should be revised so that there are no more breakdowns with an overloaded system in the future
why are you downgraded to a lower club level after a few years break you cant keep regular guests like that we might as well book on my ship there are no additional costs
this was our first cruise and it wont be the last the service staff the captain and the entertainment were all great we felt very comfortable the last day was very difficult for us
we were satisfied so far the only point deduction for us is that the cosma simply has too many people on board this means that it is always very hectic in bad weather and at meal times we prefer the smaller ships in the future
aida cruise hamburg to barbados october november booked an inside cabin sleeping or staying in the cabin is impossible after multiple complaints a new cabin was allocated after days for a payment of euros although i wrote a complaint to aida i have not received a response to date i will now contact a lawyer in addition our suitcases were forgotten on the return flight and were sent on days later no apology worst cruise company to date have now booked with costa cabin number
customer service is difficult to reach no willingness to make concessions only interested in maximum profit i would rather travel with the italian shipping company again
we were unable to reserve the flight slots for our arrival on the portal in advance when it was still not possible days before departure i was able to sort it out by phone
everything is told in german language only besides the safety regulations no explanations are giving in other languages they will send you away on the last day without any warning and without having lunch then they make you wait at an overcrowded airport for more than five hours
the cruise was a great experience all the ports of call were great the food on board was top class the journey with iberojet was extremely bad the extremely short seat pitch on a longhaul flight is unacceptable this will definitely be an exclusion criterion for the next trip
sea of lights over new years eve with the aidanova hamburg denmark and norway
modern travel lpg
we were on the aida diva in the caribbean and attended the farewell show on the second to last evening at the show entertainment manager sascha presented tours for people who were leaving the dominican republic the next day we have booked another aida tour on the way we repeatedly pointed out to the tour guide that we had to be back in time to be able to take the bus to the airport according to the tour guide this was not a problem as there was still an hours buffer in the end our tour returned later the bus left and the aida staff were reluctant and said it was our responsibility we should take a taxi and see how we get to the airport ourselves alternatively we could call rostock and possibly have the return flight rebooked of course after much discussion we took the taxi and still got our flight as suggested by the aida staff we sent the taxi receipt to customer service for reimbursement this was rejected without explanation never again aida
generally very satisfied although the service has deteriorated considerably in recent years there are more and more restrictions and prices are rising it is also very bad that the casinos on all ships only have electronic machines without any flair this made aidas concept more attractive back then with the live tables perhaps something will be changed for the better in this regard if that is the case aida should not put profit first unfortunately i have heard the same opinion from many passengers other shipping companies unfortunately have real advantages here and are better positioned in this regardnot even pole tournaments are organized anymore on the grounds that aida doesnt earn anything from them anywaya shame
too expensive for the service hidden costs service insufficient however a beautiful ship
after around years of traveling with aida i was unfortunately not at all happy with the new years eve trip on the prima an arrival package costing over per person and then traveling with a turkish budget airline and changing planes at am in antalya is simply unreasonable the same goes for the waiting times at the bar on the ship either they only want to sell drink packages and then limit the amount or there are simply too few staff at peak times we waited minutes for a drink which we then picked up ourselves as always the specialty restaurant and the two service restaurants were positive we are now going to try quotmein schiffquot and perhaps aida has lost me after more than years its a shame because ive always been a huge fan of the shipping company but this trip just wasnt good
nice ship friendly staff
i have travelled with aida many times but i have never experienced such a poorly organised tour but who is surprised when the decision makers only have semiskilled support staff nautical matters excluded
surprised by the perfect organization by the effort of much of the staff to help you using english including spanish a modern ship
quality on the aida ships has declined
the port day in copenhagen was cancelled there was no compensation not even a free shuttle to the city of hamburg the ship was full to the brim no relaxation possible you had to queue for a long time everywhere couldnt get a seat had to wait minutes or more for your drinks at the bar the travel staff gave incorrect information the christmas decorations were taken down during the trip on a christmas cruise
unfortunately our christmas trip was cut short so we were back in our home port of hamburg two days early unfortunately there was no compensation with the excuse that we could visit hamburg instead of copenhagen unfortunately we even had to pay a lot for the shuttle buses into the city and we couldnt even book a seatslot because there werent enough available unfortunately we werent allowed to take our car from the paid parking lot because we would have had to pay again unfortunately that was really pretty unfriendly to customers and made the lovely trip very unpleasant towards the end nobody can do anything about the weather but to be ripped off like that especially since the trip to copenhagen was completely eliminated is really cheeky the third trip in a row this year where a destination was eliminated anyone who thinks badly is a scoundrel unfortunately cabin service on veranda deluxe was not good this time usually otherwise very clean everywhere but waiting times are far too long and there are not enough staff you can tell that the fleet has been sold and is declining in all areas including the food unfortunately i usually love traveling on the aida no areas where you can have some peace and quiet from all the small children im a mother myself but with that number it would be urgently needed so that others can have a nice holiday too and not just those with small children who block everything with their things from and you never have the chance to get to or in the pool for example this could be easily regulated with times for example checkin was hell because due to the weather the booked checkin times were no longer kept and everyone wanted to get on the ship at the same time and aida didnt regulate this either even if after the many bad reviews here there is no high amount per person for the next trip it is clear that aida is no longer interested in not canceling trips as soon as the weather allows it or even remotely justifies it the trip was expensive enough euros for a mother and two children for days and then home days early impossible
the trip was cancelled and did not go through copenhagen no apology was offered and no voucher not even free internet to inform our families that the ship was turning back in fact they wanted us to pay euros per person for a bus to take us to the center in addition attitudes are praised such as the captain not wanting to translate to families who asked for an explanation in english why we were returning to hamburg since according to him it is a german company and that is the main language never again
trip was great except that copenhagen was completely cancelled and no refund or replacement was offered
we were generally very satisfied this was our second cruise with aida and we will certainly go on more the only negative point for us is the medical center we feel it is a ripoff our sons plaster cast had to be refixed all they did was wrap a new adhesive bandage around the existing bandage without checking that the splint was correctly positioned i could have done this myself we were then charged for this service of which was for the dressing material i find that outrageous especially since an adhesive bandage only costs a few euros in the pharmacy
arrival and departure were as is typical for aida completely problemfree service on board was great unfortunately the ship was fully booked and the range of excursions was therefore limited
old ship the shore excursions from aida are a disgrace and a ripoff i lost days of vacation because of it hours for an excursion for is a disgrace with zero service you even have to carry the loungers to the beach yourself
we were generally satisfied but one day of our trip was very disappointing with aida we booked an excursion in tenerife for euros per person this excursion could have been cancelled on the day of the excursion my mother had a circulatory collapse at the breakfast buffet in the morning of the day of the excursion she had to go to the onboard hospital where she received an infusion and she was definitely not able to come on the excursion an hour later a corona test was also done which was negative our friends went to reception and wanted to cancel the excursion for our room the information from reception was that you dont have to cancel it because the excursion is automatically cancelled because they pass on the information from the onboard hospital on the day of our payment when checking out we got a rude awakening we would only have had the excursion cancelled or our money back if my mother had tested positive for corona what is the difference here please between having corona and being bedridden with a circulatory collapse unfortunately there was no help from either the excursion center or the reception that was very disappointing
the information via email was sometimes a bit too much and repeated too often the transfer and checkin on the ship were good despite the number of passengers we also liked the onboard telephones distributed across the decks for any questions the information was generally very reliable
generally a good experience above all very friendly service staff limitations in terms of quality the small pool for bathing feet was without water for weeks and the nudist area was closed too often for repairs sometimes the stay in some ports was too short drink prices on board were too expensive too many extra costs
my son had an accident on board the hospital said that they were not allowed to issue us with an accident report and medical records we only received the bill i immediately contacted the aida care office unfortunately i was ignored our highlight copenhagen was simply canceled we had planned and booked for the day because it was canceled at such short notice we were unable to cancel our booking in copenhagen we are not receiving any compensation from aida for the spontaneous cancellation the receptionist ms breitlich treated us extremely rudely and disrespectfully she shouted at us after asking a normal question however she was very friendly and nice to the previous german customer

all in all it was a very relaxing vacation on the aidadiva this time too we quotconqueredquot the ports exclusively on foot and did not book any excursions the staff was as always very friendly and helpful embarkation was on december th in montego bayjamaica and disembarkation on december st in fortdefrancemartinique unfortunately our relaxation was put into perspective by a condor plane that was not suitable for longhaul flights seats were too hard and the legroom left a lot to be desired so that the hour outbound flight and hour return flight were not really comfortable we know better from other companies even on short and mediumhaul flights there was also quite a bit of chaos at fortdefrance airport as they are apparently not designed to handle such a large number of passengers here you should consider checking in for your flight at the port terminal just like in la romana
please do not put ships of this size into service in the future many negative points due to the size problems with ports that cannot be reached prone to strong winds which meant that our trip was cancelled compared to the smaller ships of aida significantly worse entertainment programactivities for example no pool party according to the manager on this ship a different concept
aida took care of everything at the airport luggage was brought directly from the plane to the cabin the return journey was even better organized checking in for the return flight at the port right in front of the ship no one has ever managed that well aida cant do anything about the flight delays
checkin was a disaster i stood in line for hours the staff didnt care they worked pretty slowly and without a care in general the service staff on board were very disinterested copenhagen could not be reached but there was no voucher or anything similar for the cancellation more entertainment would have been important it was boring in places that many things were closed for hours
snow chaos in germany and you only find out when you check in that the flight has been rebooked then you can see where you are staying sad complaint is ongoing no response for weeks
unfortunately one port copenhagen which was the heart of the trip was not visited at the last minute the reason was a storm that was not noticeable no compensation was given in the form of a voucher for a cocktail or something similar instead the trip was canceled and we went back to hamburg where aida kindly organized a shuttle into the city the fact that we had to pay for this was the last straw all family members also got a stomach bug the reception was extremely unfriendly
the holiday was relaxed and good as usual only the seat we booked on the return flight with more legroom which cost via aida was not available because eurowings changed planes the seats were there but not with more legroom just normal economy seats but with aida you dont get money back for not receiving the service just an excuse that you got the booked seats and a voucher for so in my opinion the customer service was poor and unfortunately its not the first experience of this kind so we will change shipping companies in the future others have nice ships too
we were on the christmas trip with the aidanova due to flooding in hamburg the journey was disastrous no information from the shipping company about closures and how to manage the journey on time the checkin process was very lengthy because after the closures were lifted many guests arrived at the terminal at the same time departure to kristiansand ok weather bad freezing rain in kristiansand no information from aida trip canceled after an hour because the roads and paths could not be walked safely due to ice onward journey to oslo ok oslo trip ok then suddenly the planned onward journey to copenhagen was canceled and the return to hamburg was announced the reason given was bad weather in hamburg with the risk of the elbehamburg entrance being prohibited completely understandable but this is not the first time this problem has occurred perhaps a different ship location should be chosen for this huge ship to avoid such problems the joy of the holiday was completely ruined afterwards the captain gave nice explanations but no apology no empathy for the guests with absolute impertinence the incident was simply ignored and the program continued as if nothing had happened it was made fun of in an unbelievable way even though many guests were furious it was boastfully offered that the ship could be used until the end in hamburg as if it were a gift from the shipping company you paid for that in hamburg a bus shuttle service was organized for which you even had to pay unbelievable there are simply too many guests on the ship the behavior of some guests was borderline wandering around bars halfnaked in cheap bathrobes hardly any free seats constant waiting and the work ethic of the crew well if you like waiting minutes for your drink or food this is the place for you some of the comments were sexist and suggestive and you really dont want to hear them anymore the quality of the food varied greatly sometimes it was good sometimes it was overcooked overall a very bad vacation and not a good review for aida we will never travel with them again not recommended in this form
aida is cutting costs everywhere even though the prices for the trips are at record levels prices are well above precovid levels nevertheless decorations are being cut back there are no more nuts at the bars events such as officer shakes and the like are missing staff are missing which is why the service is not working catastrophic trip
unfortunately aida is slowly degenerating into a cruise junk shop unfortunately nothing remains of the high standards of the first few years we felt we were not being looked after and had the feeling that we were just a financial cash cow the service has been drastically reduced in recent years definitely not recommended there are a lot of better providers now
as a wheelchair user you often feel left alone this is due to overcrowded ships and too small passenger chairs
failed to enter port for the fourth time breach of contract
the expectations were more than exceeded the friendliness and service were outstanding the next trip can come
basically no major complaints minor things were accepted overall the trip was well organized the aida employees were competent
theres no point in writing anything here we entered it for all trips and it hasnt improved in the slightest on the contrary
nothing went wrong unfortunately we could not reach the ports of haifa and aquaba
arrival and departure service and baggage handling are very good group shore excursions are very large prices are completely excessive in my opinion better to book individually on site drink prices on board are high good service clean cabin reserve your lounger in good time on sea days
pricing of excursions no longer fits
aida is saving more and more on customers even though the ships are full and the prices are higher than before corona the ratio of passengers to crew is no longer right too many new employees in the main season are making the service worse little things like decorations nuts at the bar but also paper and pen in the cabins are being saved because many are taking a cruise with aida for the first time many dont notice frequent travelers notice the reduction in service but aida doesnt care complaints handling has also become poor before covid if there were justified complaints there was first a coffee to talk to and then an apology with vouchers today its just a conversation and the statement that rostock will get in touch if necessary its a service desert but just wait at some point the boom will be over then youll look for the customers who have run away
great value for money excellent program on board very good service on board and restaurants aida excursions are expensive better to join other ship guests and go on individual excursions internet was only partially available
aida is currently no longer what it used to be service and quality on board have deteriorated rapidly months ago everything was top notch on the nova this time we had to stand at the reception times just because of the absolutely unacceptable cabin each time waiting at least minutes after days we were finally allowed to move only then did we have our vacation but then we got off the ship on day thats saying something aida please please change again as a frequent traveler i am just disappointed and shocked
after around aida cruises i turned my back on aida due to bad experiences and prefer to use other cruise lines the bad experiences ended in a court case which i won for the most part but i was still left with part of the costs in court the beams were bent with the lies that a certain shipping company told you always need a lawyer with you here please learn that it is not enough to report the travel defects and have them confirmed as a defect you also have to give them a reasonable deadline to remedy the defect otherwise you as a consumer will also be left with part of the costs
we were on board the aida prima for days the drinks at the bars usually took between and minutes lots of annoying onboard announcements a lot of time wasted at passport controls and checkin for the return flight the ship was overcrowded the restaurants were overflowing and the drinks dispensers were empty for us it was the first time with aida and definitely the last time we are glad to finally be back home to recover from the stress on board
since we have already traveled with msc and were not at all satisfied with this shipping company we would only travel with aida from now on
a place for parents with children ship suitable for disabled people good cabin facilities meanwhile good internet at sea
a day cruise northern europe norway and then a tour of major cities on the aidanova with once again a fully booked ship and the service checkin border force london bar staff was completely overloaded that is lousy and compared to our first experience on the aidaluna which was just as crowded even with a captains note in an announcement but smaller and more familyfriendly this time it was very bad for a long vacation the quotexperience the brandquot marketing also lacks the great quotyoure on vacationquot moment which was celebrated very nicely on the small aidaluna on the large aidanova there is just mass without class no champagne buffet just a superficial quotyoure on vacationquot much worse was that for three nights in a row on the metropolis tour le havre rotterdam zeebrugge we were in bed with a balcony cabin at am because the docking preparations were carried out with a sledgehammer hitting steel to describe the noise so never again on the th floor with a balcony cabin that is more than just a disturbance of the peace we had paid ie the full price like everyone else and still received no help from reception and we will not accept that but there was no other room available either how could there be when the boat is jampacked terrible in the future we will probably not book with aida again ps checking out with border force in south hampton took an entire morning until late afternoon because for what felt like guests three border force employees took a look at the passport without any technical query completely questionable for the actual purpose and also far too long for the duration conclusion aida has extremely poor quality management no feedback or compensation the main thing is that you pay the full price but no service promise we will avoid recommending aida in the future
left alone with child in london we had been told that the bus would be waiting for us at the meeting point minutes before we got to the london eye the woman from the bus called to say that the bus was full and had left without us seriously another employee called us and told us to take a taxi which would be quicker than the train and if we missed the ship leave our suitcases at the terminal in southampton and we would have to see how we got to kiel now i know that the train takes hour and the taxi takes hours the excursion was booked through aida we should hurry up otherwise were out of luck it was pm we were at the ship at pm and it hadnt left for hours aida doesnt want to refund the taxi fare of even though we were forced to take the taxi such a large shipping company leaves mother and child alone in london the woman from the excursion bus only spoke english we didnt understand anything she said before we were wandering around london
my girlfriend got a gastrointestinal virus on board and was isolated when i had similar symptoms a day later i also contacted the hospital to report my illness since the examination of my girlfriend had already cost a lot of money i did not want to be examined but simply reported that i was also ill and would be in isolation the doctor insisted however that i had to be examined quote quotnothing in life is freequot if i do not get myself examined there will be consequences she added the whole thing sounds different with my girlfriend the day before here my girlfriend could decide whether she wanted to be examined or not intimidated i went to the doctors station and had myself examined my girlfriend was not able to go on a single excursion and at the end of the day we had to pay a hefty sum for the fact that a gastrointestinal virus had apparently been on the ship for a long time there was no hand disinfection anymore as there was an extremely high demand on the previous trip said the doctor we were on a cruise with our parents so out of a total of people fell ill on this ship we all live far away from each other and so we were really looking forward to the vacation but it was just a nightmare due to a storm we arrived at the port of hamburg a day early and we took the opportunity and more or less escaped
the priceperformance ratio is not right the service is better with other shipping companies unfortunately it didnt really meet our expectations
a route is booked because it involves various wishes plans interests if aida simply comments on these with the reason quotthe excursion is cancelled for organizational reasonsquot it is disappointing nobody takes care of equivalent alternatives or in our case they do so too late the only positive thing was the light food offer with a very committed staff member
tendering with lifeboats is not reasonable on cruise ships these are rescue devices and are intended for emergencies even in light seas going ashore is not possible therefore appropriate tender boats must be provided for quottender portsquot
our booked cruise took us on a caribbean trip over christmas unfortunately aida completely ruined it after we arrived we discovered that one of our suitcases was missing the constant statement that it might still arrive on the evening of arrival was not confirmed unfortunately due to the day of arrival i only had a limited change of clothes in my hand luggage we were told that this would be taken care of we only received a toothbrush for the night neither underwear nor a shirt were provided the next evening it turned out that the suitcase had been left at the departure point due to the individual island visits delivery would only be possible on the th day of vacation however we did not receive the luggage again and so we have to go without luggage for days and only get reimbursement on tshirts i have never experienced anything ridiculous on any trip before in addition arrival and departure times on land are constantly being changed and shortened aida never again
as far as the onboard processes are concerned the cruise was entirely positive however the shore excursions offered by aida are clearly overpriced as a rule a comparable offer can be obtained at significantly cheaper rates through thirdparty providers on the internet or from local providers waiting at the docks
we booked a cruise in the premium category for january so that we could use railampfly for free among other things due to the massive widespread and longlasting strikes announced by the railway from january th we contacted aida in order to avoid any possible travel problems early on we wanted to know whether there were any alternatives to travelling to the airport by train possibly also departing from another airport for example luxembourg airport is now available as a departure airport we booked by phone at the beginning of august which was not the case when we booked or rather we were not informed of this by the employee at the time customer service told us that getting to the airport was our problem even if we booked through aida we could arrive a day earlier but what if the railway goes on strike what about the additional costs that arise such as an additional hotel night or if we travel by ourselves whether we have to cover the fuel and parking costs none of them rebooking to another airport is also not possible days before departure although there is free capacity on the alternative flight and the days before departure are not a problem aida is as flexible as a brick wall here and the customer is left out in the cold with railampfly you are suggested that you can have a carefree vacation from the start but it is actually just eyewash that is what i call great customer service the first time with aida and as of today the last time
beautiful ship great ports great service
poor execution and misleading description of the excursions
aidas behavior was really the worst when we checked out of aida some of our suitcases were completely destroyed will they cover the damage no way they want to fob us off with a voucher the letters from them are hard to beat in terms of arrogance they know full well that a legal dispute over a suitcase is not worth it all i can say is that we will never travel with aida again
xxxx booked excursion cancelled and money still not refunded disgusting
these cruises are a nice invention but they are increasingly becoming a moneyprinting machine
aida could do more to provide information on board and in general i suspect that the ships are slowly but surely becoming party ships greetings from mallorca the customs are becoming more and more coarse in terms of decency and behavior including towards the employees
all in all we left the ship very satisfied the team behind the scenes showed everything again during the week unfortunately they cant do anything about the mentality of the people who were on board with us
on the rd trip the service was a disaster
actually only the ship and the captain and some of the service staff were good services such as service internet etc were very very bad
what happened to us in the last few weeks as a result of this cruise booking was not nice my mothers partner had a stroke and we tried to rebook my mother who now has to fly alone onto another flight of course that didnt work they suggested completely new flights for all of us people for a fee of euros per person with transfers so not feasible with our baby anyway and aida couldnt do anything because we booked through ehoi and only had to contact the travel agency the cancellation fees are also abysmal of the total price of euros from the person who cannot fly because of her stroke we only get euros back the rest are cancellation costs its going to be a really sad christmas on the aida cosma this year because we set sail on december rd
there are simply better shipping companies
as far as the cruise the boat and the service are concerned i agree with the positive reports one of the negative reactions below is the language of instruction which is german but if you start in english you will also get an english answer nongerman speakers are also asked for at the shows and bingo and the annoying germans on board go on the next cruise with msc the english do this to a superlative degree but still a minus point the wifi sold for euros for two aircraft for a day cruise speed is quite good nothing to complain about apps from the dutch banks work perfectly but the aida app is unstable and very clear do you use a vpn then you can shake it they know the problems and have a list of vpns that are supported outdated therefore too little maintenance is done aidas piece of advice is to turn on flight mode if you have problems with wifi mi bull shit coverage in buildings is not good everywhere also a maintenance issue for a wifi system there must be management for the installation for updates measurements and correct operation of the wifi the location determination of the gps at sea is influenced by the wifi as soon as you leave the tidal inlet there is no longer any location determination but once you are in a port it is again some apps like grinder are limited in sending messages this can be solved with a vpn but then the aida app no longer works with a number of vpns in short you pay a lot of money for outdated wifi on board after days of cruising i was able to get my money back but then i was immediately without wifi this indicates that they themselves are not charmed by this service in short whether aidas inadequate wifi or being at the mercy of the public networks at sea and in the countries to be visited neither is good hope this is of some use to you
aida stands for arrogance incompetence amateurism and ripoffs the entire organization was not working from day one for example you couldnt complete the mandatory safety training on the tv or on your cell phone as newbies we had to look for the assembly point without any training or orientation when i asked which side port was on an aida employee with a pitying smile explained that port was at the back and starboard was at the front by the helm the entire ship including the restaurants was so cold that you needed a jacket or sweater when the outside temperature was degrees many passengers including us had severe colds complaints about this as well as others were unsuccessful by chance we discovered that we had been charged euros two days before for a tour that we hadnt booked without informing us unbelievable information such as the best way to get from the port to the cities was searched for in vain when asked attempts are made to sell one of the completely overpriced aida excursions local maps are provided with sometimes completely incorrect entries listing all of the annoyances and incompetence would go beyond the scope of this forum however we can give a positive assessment of the filipino waiters and waitresses in the restaurants and the room service
if prebooked excursions are cancelled offer alternatives unfortunately this did not happen on this trip and two prebooked excursions were cancelled catamaran trip to fuerteventura on december th and fullday trip to maspalomas on december th
great mallorcadubai although the general terms and conditions refer to the european conditions for package tours these are neither mentioned nor taken into account in complaints this means that the customer is forced to sue as the cancellation costs regardless of the reason in this case extensive route changes are always adhered to if a direct debit is returned for good reason creditreform is immediately threatened but you shouldnt let that put you off and should contact a specialist lawyer legal expenses insurance pays for this customers have rights too
travel booking was very good unfortunately there were no alternative offers to the flight only one airline was mentioned
simply everything to put it briefly when arriving you could have had the entry forms in advance then you could have filled them out at home in peace i dont speak english so you could have filled them out at home and thats why we are traveling with aida
the ship is too big and does not offer a personal connectionfeeling like the aidaprima for example the owners made a mistake here because bigger is not always better if there are parents with very small children then there are special table rows or dining areas disembarkation or outboarding was a disaster older passengers stood in queues for hours not to mention disabled people and wheelchair users the ships management has obviously never heard of organization although they made a little effort very simple now deck later deck etc but not like sheep all at once
it was a great trip the prices and service were simply superb our respect for the staff
the cruise was very good the shore excursions were not all good sometimes too expensive
the many ports and especially madeira
the worst experience was the poor organization when leaving the ship on the day of departure pure chaos and that was definitely not because we were a few hours late docking in hamburg masses of people stood for hours packed tightly together with suitcases and strollers and walkers on deck and there was no way back or forth its unthinkable how a sea rescue would go
everything went well and worked from arrival to departure we were very satisfied
the end of the flagpole has not yet been reached
big problems when traveling with a family with small children and family members with disabilities aida customer center did not respond to repeated inquiries showed no interest in solving the problem in addition an additional charge had to be paid due to a computer problem that aida has known about for several months
basically the only negative aspects of the trip were that the ports of haifa and aqaba were not visited for understandable security reasons its a shame that these highlights were omitted and the entry procedure through the uae as well as the checkin through emirates in the port terminal
in dubai we had to go through passport control which was at pm at the port it took a full minutes until we got through the entire ship to the port terminal and could show our passports aida should have set up a time slot after that in the evening we then had to drop off our suitcases this is apparently a new regulation in dubai so we stood in a queue with our suitcases for another minutes until we could drop them off at ems in the port terminal
the service begins with the booking and continues until the end of the trip
we very loyal and above all satisfied aida guests wanted to do something good for our parents together with the rest of the family and as we had long wanted gave them a short trip to stavanger norway the trip starts in may booked half a year ago the whole family is coming now we get quotsuper great newsquot that our trip is now going to be a festival tour who on earth wants that and the route changes and that is the greatest impudence ever from stavanger norway to copenhagen denmark if i had wanted to go to copenhagen i would have booked it that way its outrageous and sooo annoying our last route in september was also changed which really annoyed us because instead of italy we suddenly stopped in turkey and we didnt like it at all and now this instead of norwegian fjords we went to a city in denmark that was completely uninteresting to us thank you aida for nothing unfortunately rebooking is not possible except for cancellation but everyone was so looking forward to it just sad because even the recipients are very disappointed
aida has seriously deteriorated in terms of service and quality with its large ships the last tour with the nova on the metropolitan route was a disaster in terms of service we can rate this highly as we have sailed with aida over times in the last years
the bands and djs on board werent great on this tour i wasnt used to long waiting times like on this tour in the bars
at and years old with a lot of travel experience and five cruises with three shipping companies we absolutely agree that the last cruise with the aida nova was by far the worst trip of our lives this trip was the first one that we would have liked to have cut short earlier and were looking forward to going home several paid services were not provided not provided in full andor on time the full price was of course charged in all cases complaints on board turn out to be a complete waste of time incompetent managers completely overworked staff who have our full sympathy poor flow of information on board technical problems on every single day of the trip chaos in some restaurants the list is almost endless we are grateful to be back home and our need for trips with aida is absolutely satisfied we wanted to give the nova a second chance after our trip in june on this ship was already very problematic we now regret having booked aida again and will not make this mistake again instead we will now give a lawyer the mandate for the first time to represent our rights and interests against a travel provider after all attempts to reach an amicable outofcourt settlement failed
poor organization of the trip and shore excursions bad internet low standard bad entertainment
suez canal in general we liked it very much the vacation on the ship is relaxed and pleasant unfortunately aqaba was excluded due to the current situation therefore even more days at sea in a row we would have liked to have had an alternative port of call in egypt as many more days at sea followed we always enjoyed eating in the market restaurant but unfortunately the food on offer has always been the same since we reached the red sea we would have liked more variety here the immigration control in dubai was catastrophic a minus performance by the organization a total chaos
the trip itself was wonderful the excursions did not match the description far too expensive two people in the bus to the beach a taxi the staff needs to be better trained
the trip was perfect everything went as planned the crew made the stay on board and in the ports an experience thank you
in my opinion the aida concept is very well thought out however i dont like the trend towards ever larger ships at all
the collection of our suitcases from home was carried out flawlessly within the specified time frame after we checked in the suitcases were in front of our cabin undamaged the delivery service home was just as uncomplicated although i was skeptical at first and a little worried about my suitcase and its contents i can now confidently say i would use this service again if i travel by train the young men who picked up and delivered the suitcases are also worth a special mention here
the ship was totally overcrowded you had to queue for a long time everywhere you were ignored at the bars you rarely got drinks the drinks package wasnt worth it on top of that when we left our suitcases were damaged by the aida staff when we checked out there was no notice on the suitcases aida does not adhere to the legal compensation procedures cruises are definitely nice but we dont plan on traveling with aida again
ports industrial ports involve long bus rides excursions are poorly coordinated promotional films do not correspond to the subsequent excursions
there are no complaints great ship great service great excursion destinations thank you very much for the wonderful time
everything is fine the crew ship norway everything except the internet i even bought extra but its useless
problemfree organization of arrival and departure good reliable travel provider
quantity instead of quality unfortunately there are too many passengers on the nova and the feelgood factor falls by the wayside
on a giant ship from hamburg to norway almost people including children create a center park feeling on every corner there is hardly a place where people arent running raging screaming and crying most parents and passengers manage the rest through ignorance lack of consideration etc etc this has nothing to do with a quotcruisequot gone are the days when the focus was on traveling and not entertainment climbing sliding drinking all in we will no longer pay for this quotballermannquot level but would rather travel on beautiful ships
aida is ripping off its customers first of all i would like to stress that the review relates exclusively to aida cruises in rostock with one exception a young man at reception the crew on board were all extremely friendly we were on the transvoyage from antalya to mauritius it is understandable that israel is not included in the tour however the fact that they claim up until the last minute that jordan will be visited and then in a real farce the whole thing is cancelled is just a ripoff of the customers it was already known when they left antalya that aqaba would not be called at see interview with captain reisefilm if this had been announced before the trip began many people would probably have cancelled the trip that is why they waited until shortly before the trip to cancel as the mood on board was not very good the war has not only been going on for a few days aida should have had an alternative other shipping companies have managed that too we were fobbed off with an extra day at sea for a shorter journey aida has created advantages for itself by doing this less port fees and less fuel costs i would never have booked the trip like that a complaint has already been sent to aida
from year to year the services during the cruise are reduced or you have to pay for them the service is still very good unfortunately the shows are often in english
it was the worst trip of my life everything was bad from the first to the last second the company is only interested in profit thats what i was told when i complained its sad that you spend so much money and get nothing out of it because the ship was hopelessly overcrowded it would be better to burn money then at least you would have had warm hands but if individuals complain unfortunately it doesnt change anything because there are enough new stupid people who put up with this kind of thing update from aida has now responded to my complaint it would be very regrettable about all the things that happened also the incorrect treatment of my mother in the hospice which meant that none of us could enjoy the trip for even hour i was offered a euro credit for the next trip as a gesture of goodwill i politely declined this a little over of the cost is such an absolute impertinence to offer someone for a trip that was intended as a farewell to my seriously ill mother
arrivals and departures are very well organized any problems on board are dealt with and solved quickly by the staff
for flights it is better to contact the airline
great ship the nova metropolis tour is actually good but ports are mostly catastrophic industrial ports
it was a beautiful trip which did have one or two minor problems but these were rarely aidas fault but rather the fault of the local authorities who did not allow shore leave or the luggage in hamburg which led to unnecessary waiting times
extensive range of shore excursions and on board
it would make sense if aida aligned itself with the competition excursions are coffee trips and booking confirmations are useless even though you have booked and paid for an xxl seat you dont get it
you book a complete package with xxl legroom pay for it and get a seat in the middle of a row of four aidas statement we have no influence on the airlines seat allocation question why do you then sell the xxl option why do i get my seat confirmed in advance thats how you can ruin someones vacation on the last day never again with aida the amount is debited days in advance but you dont get the service
everything otherwise we would be on board for the rd time
on my first sea voyage i was overwhelmed by the ship and the services on offer the medical department made me feel alone with my worries perhaps it was due to the lack of transparency that even serious intestinal infections are part of everyday life and are simply dealt with rationally
attempts are made to pick up travelers this does not always work on excursions efforts should be made to speak more german
nice trip unfortunately because of the weather there was a bit more sea and we couldnt call at a port
the ship urgently needs to be overhauled the pool area was not completely available there was rust under the handrails outside and on the supporting structures there was also rust on the balconies that was not a good impression for new travelers and forces you to test new ships from other shipping companies
the expectation after years without a cruise has been met by there are still a few processing exercises to be completed in the organization
we were travelling with our grandchildren aged months and years children are given a lot of consideration and everything you need is there safety on board is also very good you dont have to keep an eye on the kids all the time overall you cant expect more for your kids we had everything we needed
the service staff in particular contributed a lot to the success of the trip
super nice unfortunately the guests on aida as well as on other ships are becoming more rude thats why x deduction
the checkin on november took over an hour this was extremely difficult for older people several passengers complained of severe stomach and intestinal problems on the ship and afterwards
aida shortened our cruise by one day because the original port rotterdam could not be reached due to the weather we were informed by phone of the changed departure date and port hamburg we would of course be reimbursed for the lost day and the travel costs to hamburg so far everything was fine the arrival and checkin in hamburg was a complete disaster no one was prepared for a checkin we were left completely alone it was a shame because it was our first cruise any criticism we expressed about the checkin was completely ignored by customer service emails were not answered we are still waiting for our money we are extremely disappointed with aida i understand customer service differently as a customer you are ignored it is a shame
in general everything was good everything was very clean a lot of crew on board the boat was spectacular the wellness area etc downsides zero internet even if you pay for this it is already rare in and spanish language and tv channel please they are in several languages and with the spaniards there is nothing in spanish on the cruise for those who do not understand another language i recommend the cruise yes and more if you pay what i paid very little
great successful very organized sea voyage and very varied sea voyage with an excellent ship at the highest level from the staff to the equipment
warning about aida if you are planning to book a cruise with aida and want or even need to take a mobility aid on board with you and use it prepare yourself for major difficulties when booking an electric wheelchair is no problem but aida also incorrectly refers to electric vehicles as scooters and prohibits their use on board travelscoot has repeatedly and extensively pointed out to aida for years that scooters is merely a collective term for all kinds of vehicles that cannot be classified as cars motorcycles and bicycles scooters come from the english language and mean scooter in german they can have two or more small wheels be powered by hand foot electric or petrol these are usually fun vehicles and have no place on ships but electric vehicles are not fun vehicles they are mobility aids on an equal footing with wheelchairs and are therefore legally required to be carried on board by all passenger transport companies and their use must be permitted as long as the infrastructure allows it for many years aida has required the submission of a nonsensically designed questionnaire see below in it you either have to tick an electric wheelchair but the second and last option is a walker or a scooter which is then not approved for use on board see also the relevant aida questionnaire below unfortunately aida is completely resistant to instruction in this regard and is probably even violating relevant laws other cruise operators are not aware of these problems
the support from aida cruises is really the worst on average you wait days for a response the trip is already over and you get a response criticism is also completely out of the question this kind of thing just bounces off this provider
we booked a cruise from palma to dubai on november th to december th we received multiple route changes by email because now we are almost doing a tour of greece we called customer service several times but didnt get any concrete information there either we sent an email to customer service asking for a call back and to this day days before departure we have not received a response from aida the worst customer service ever one thing we know never again aida
good captain sven laudans communication during the entire day voyage and his decision to wait out the weather in the bay of biscay with knots of wind negative walkers and wheelchairs standing in front of the cabin doors block the escape routes
nice helpful staff great ship beautiful harbors
as usual everything was ok the usual small defects but they were not a problem the priceperformance ratio for solo travelers needs to be improved certain tours are so expensive for solo travelers that they are apparently not wanted
information about the transfer to the airport was too late which meant that i had to cancel the trip on in la romana hours in advance we had to move to another cabin for the day we had booked i would have liked more time for some of the trips on land more information about port moorings how and whether the cities can be explored on your own
welltrained and friendly staff ship well equipped and very clean announcements only in two languages german and english so not unpleasant
i dont even know where to start from the very beginning we as customers were just fooled shortly after booking the route was changed within europe lisbon barcelona and france were simply cancelled so there were no reasons for this such as war or something similar fuerteventura was supposed to be called at shortly after the start of the trip fuerteventura was then cancelled without any valid reason or only excuses were given a crew member made it clear that it was really only because it was uneconomical for aida and therefore the port was not called at and not really because of the time factor we would have managed it in terms of time without any problems so we had almost only days at sea we would never have spent so much money on that criticism was noticeably unwelcome on board and by everyone involved never again aida if aida continues to be difficult i will hand everything over to my lawyer dont book with them other providers are certainly better and stick to their offer
ship was huge
zero goodwill now were drawing our conclusions weve already taken countless cruises especially with aida and tui the social media flat rate is suddenly canceled without any notice without notice we asked the aida hotline for advice beforehand we received no information that it was being canceled so for us its an additional cost of euros outrageous lets see how long aida can afford this arrogance tui is not much more expensive but you get significantly more comfort and services
everything was fine on the ship but the flight we had booked didnt go smoothly we had an unplanned sixhour layover because we didnt get off the plane in total we were seven hours late in arriving and the planned afternoon in corfu didnt happen any other travel agent would have apologized for the inconvenience or even offered compensation but aida apparently had nothing to do with the flight and transfer we had booked
it was a very nice albeit windy trip unfortunately we were unable to reach rotterdam which was a real shame
from arrival to departure everything runs smoothly if something doesnt work out they always try to fix it immediately
ship at capacity is too much of an imposition for passengers and crew
overcrowded ship and unfriendly german staff and bad advice on the boat
everything was super organized and professional despite the large number of people they tried to create a family atmosphere the captain was present and you could tell that seafaring was his passion we really enjoyed the week in the mediterranean
port transfers are completely overpriceda family with children pay euros in barcelona and marseillefor a minute bus ride in some placesa disgracewe were on a week mediterranean cruise arrived todaynever againripoff
there is apparently no longer any goodwill on aidablu two examples i won an ice cream voucher on board but it was only valid for one week and i was not allowed to redeem it in the second week on board when one of the four of us had his id card stolen and was therefore not allowed to go on his excursion the price of the excursions for the other three was not refunded the person who was not allowed to go on the excursion is and had a birthday that day logically we wanted to spend the day together
its a very nice ship but a few things need to be done
everything went smoothly from booking to the flight home on a ship with so many people you have to remember that many needs come together i think aida has it under control i would go back anytime
the service on board has gotten worse on our previous trips we had a break after dropping off our luggage now its just stress unfriendly annoyed port staff waiting times are too long no matter where service staff on board are no longer customeroriented long waits at bars if anyone comes at all no thank you for tips for the money you pay i personally expect more
the organization of checkin and checkout we were able to move into our cabin at pm i was skeptical with passengers the crew was great helpful friendly we felt completely at home
unfortunately i am very disappointed with the trip because the ship was completely overcrowded and even this large ship cannot accommodate the people inside
wellplanned journey competent staff and close ports for departure
terrible organization of the journey home the ship couldnt dock on time due to the weather missed the flight home to hamburg then landed in dsseldorf car in hamburg on advice booked the train to hamburg euros extra train cancelled now were sitting in the rental car euros extra on the way to our car then driving another hours home after a day like that theres not much of a holiday feeling left hopefully we wont be stuck with the extra costs we had actually already paid for the entire journey home in the package
aida was supposed to be a nice trip i sent an inquiry to an employee about a trip on october from warnemnde even though i clearly stated that i did not want to go on the trip he made a booking out of it i actually wanted to go on another cheaper trip but since this company would not let me out of this booking and i did not want a legal dispute i went on this trip on a very old ship with not so good equipment anyway what remains is the experience of how dishonestly the aida employees treat customers in order to make deals i will look for other providers i cannot recommend aida many things that were previously included on board are now subject to a charge you pay a hefty price and are further ripped off on board
the concept is consistent all around from booking through to departure
it is very nice to arrive in a new port almost every morning and be greeted by the captain to start the day the service staff often anticipated your wishes and were always very friendly
in my opinion the company did everything right i would make another trip any time the ship could be a bit smaller
a great ship unfortunately far too full especially with too many children and young people more of a party and youth club ship relatively few service staff not exactly cheap in terms of price often overloaded in service
put the customer first again because we are the ones who pay we are the customers who have remained loyal to you even during the pandemic lots of commercialism little things like bingo have become outrageously expensive its no longer about fun its just about sales and profit on aidas part the final cake is just fake little things that arent pretty but stand out complaints about loud cabins and very poorly functioning internet costs a whopping euros per day are not taken seriously instead of getting better with increasing experience over the years aida is unfortunately slacking off in the past smiles were at home now it seems that its all about commercialism ever larger ships more and more quantity instead of quality the aida feeling is no longer theresuch a shame we were always enthusiastic and remained loyal to aida for a very long time
we were in norway and denmark for days on the aida nova in autumn it was our first cruise and what can i say we werent that impressed the journey with deutsche bahn was a disaster of course when guests arrive at the start of the holidays there is chaos the trains were packed there was no room for luggage and there was also a small child who had to vomit several times checkin was very exhausting lots of people long lines similar to the airport including security checks as newcomers to cruises we didnt know our way around there was no introduction and so we had to learn to find our way around first luckily there were lots of nice guests who were able to help and tell us where to find our cabin i would have expected that from the service staff at checkin the ship was incredibly full on the sea days you hardly had a chance to use the activities because you have to reserve them all in advance if we had known that we would have done it right at the beginning but we were left emptyhanded its a shame once again there was a lack of information the bathing area was tense there were also too many guests in a small space in my opinion the elements was not heated enough to walk around in swimwear it was comfortable in jeans and a light sweater the concept of having everything in one room may work in summer but unfortunately not in winter in terms of safety we didnt have a childs vest in the cabin this was discovered during the safety briefing and we were told that the vest would be replaced unfortunately that didnt happen by the end of the trip although i called reception every day and asked for it the same thing happened with the childs bathrobe unfortunately it was never replaced either in general the ladies at reception didnt seem to be well informed and they often gave us incorrect information which made us feel uncertain the service staff was very mixed there were employees who were also very annoyed by the masses of people and took this out on the guests for the most part however they were very friendly and accommodating i also found the situation at the buffet problematic there was only one buffet restaurant that was open hours a day so it was always packed when everyone came back from the shore excursions and wanted something to eat the food there was not for people who are careful about their diet mainly fast food and fried food no variety in the dishes the fish was almost exclusively herring its very cheap and full of bones the chips were fried in the same fat as the sausage and tasted like it not a single vegetarian source of protein you had to pay extra for all activities i hadnt expected that and so the trip quickly became very expensive regarding departure i also found it very problematic that the information was either not provided at all or very late on the way there there were shuttle buses from the train station to the ship on the way back you had to book this shuttle we found this out from the onboard newspaper which was hanging on the door every morning unfortunately this newspaper said that you had to book the shuttle by am on the same day its just a shame if you dont read the newspaper until after so we were unlucky and had to organize our own return to the station the criticism didnt go down well with reception the nice lady just wasnt interested now for the positive the shore excursions were very well organized the extremely charming local older ladies who were used as guides were great and made the excursions very entertaining and informative in the big cities we booked the hop on hop off tours and were able to organize the tour ourselves on the last day at sea we got the chance to use the mystery room early it was very expensive but really fun my child also had a lot of fun with the virtual reality game that too was subject to a charge as i later saw on the onboard bill so all in all a very mixed experience i think if youre not going on vacation it could be quite nice if youre prepared for the fact that everything really is subject to a charge and are prepared to spend a lot of money the fact that you can travel overnight and arrive at a different place every day and explore the area is great
the ship is far too full the noise level is correspondingly much too high and often difficult to bear the waiting times are far too long whether for drinks or a free table in the restaurant children have their own area including several pools but they besiege the already too few and far too small outdoor pools so we were unable to use them sunbeds are reserved by guests but not used after breakfast we walked around two decks in circles for an hour but could not find a free sunbed although most of them were not occupied by people just towels the stop in marseille was spontaneously cancelled which meant we were unable to keep an appointment we had booked the trip spontaneously so the flights were only available with departure airports km away not an option for us so we booked the flights separately on site we found out that we were therefore not entitled to the transfer buses to the airport when we asked we were refused the opportunity to travel even if we paid even though the buses were only half full we didnt use any shore excursions because they are far too expensive if you do your research and use other providers or travel by public transport its much cheaper we couldnt make an online reservation in advance because the confirmation field was inactive on the ship they couldnt or wouldnt help us and just told us that we could book on site of course without any early bird savings we did this for the two days at sea but the videos wouldnt load and the internet was only called premium but it isnt positive thanks to the large number of restaurants there are enough alternatives no problem even for vegetarians and the taste is very good

not dogfriendly a disappointing experience for pet owners i recently travelled on the color line ferry from norway to denmark and was deeply disappointed with the lack of consideration for dog owners this ferry line appears to prioritize smokers over pet owners which was evident throughout the journey dog owners beware if you have a dog avoid this ferry line unlike other ferries where you can keep your dog with you on the outdoor deck if you dont want to leave them in a cage or car color line offers no such accommodations there was no designated area for dogs to urinate and no sheltered places for owners to sit with their dogs meanwhile there were plenty of shelters for smokers compared to the fjord line the ticket price for color line was almost twice as expensive as fjord line yet the latter provided a far superior experience fjord line offered heated areas with couches and special spots for dogs to relieve themselves this stark contrast in service was quite disappointing poor customer service to address my concerns i approached the reception to get an email address for customer service the staff member an older man with stars on his uniform was incredibly rude he told me to leave the area immediately because i had my dog with me while i understand rules are rules his manner was abrupt and unprofessional as i tried to explain my situation and apologize he started petting my dog without permission when i asked my dog to come to me the staff member became visibly angry cut me off midsentence and stormed off without another word such stubborn and unprofessional behaviour is unacceptable especially in a customerfacing role conclusion this experience was the worst ive had on a ferry and i will never use color line again other dog owners i met on the ferry shared similar sentiments if you are a dog owner i strongly recommend avoiding color line and opting for more petfriendly alternatives like fjord line color line needs to seriously reconsider their policies and training for dealing with pet owners to avoid such negative experiences in the future
applies to the boats oslo kiel those who work on board sour and grumpy and not a nice crew at all the ones in duty free the ones at the buffet up the burger bar pub the resturangene pretty much all over the boat have traveled with these boats for years there is absolutely no nice company to travel with anymore they are going to have a big loss of customers when the new route from vippen goes to dannark since dfds has been acquired by a swedish company everyone misses the stone and those who worked there there were nice people and welcoming and totally different and the prices on colorline have become absolutely hellish both in duty free and in the bars we are looking forward to the arrival of the new boats that will go to denmark will never be bothered to travel with these boats again roll of the dice after years the last years they dont increase prices by a few kroner its several hundreds at a time ap and hs boats this
its ok for a short crossing to oslo and back the breakfast is plentiful and varied the ship itself is very clean and the staff are generally friendly but sometimes quite cluelessuncertain and unfortunately with a few exceptions the english is also pretty sparse so you still have to communicate with your hands and feet a service employee called baron really stood out he spoke good english and was extremely friendly and courteous and he also took care of things when others simply ignored the table because it was a bit further away
the trip from kiel to oslo went smoothly the ship left on time and arrived back in oslo or kiel on the exact minute everything on the ship is fantastically organized anyone who has something to complain about is better off staying at home
well organized when checking in and when boarding the ferry the ship gives a very safe impression the staff is always polite the crossing to kristiansand takes hours my tip book the dinner package the selection is huge and the quality is excellent you are also assigned a table that is reserved for the entire crossing
we had to pay to lie on the floor in voyagerclass when we sailed on the night boat in addition there was no customer service to get help from when the boat was cancelled the prices of the tickets have risen since
i hope ill never have to use the ferry between larvik and hortshals again expensive and extremelig bad customer service so rude and unfriendly like a robot left with anger and rage starting a holiday to my second homecontry with a bad tast in my mouth love denmark abolutelig loath color line
it is completely impossible to get information about whether the ferry actually runs or not no one can respond to updates about crashes in hirtshals you have to read about everything in the newspaper not from color line itself there is no information on their own pages on facebook it is not even mentioned terrible customer service we sit here and dont know if our trip will be canceled or not
a mini cruise with colour line trip including oslo rated out of points service on the ship good offers and food good negative bed bugs booking was a complete disaster only reachable by phone after minutes if at all no one is ever called back when you press the star button double booking incorrect booking by colourline and to date no refund it should be back in the account in days today is the th day outrageous email contact and calls hardly possible not good service and very annoying
if the ferry is cancelled due to weather which can happen you wont get any help cancellation refund rebooking youre left out in the cold thank you colorline for not being available at all and for not calling us back keep it up otherwise the experience has always been very positive cleanliness punctuality safety everything is ok
we have been traveling to norway once a year for years in the past we also went with fjordline a few times but for the last years we have only traveled with colourline this year from october th to october st as is well known the return journey was cancelled on all baltic sea ferries due to storms and we had to travel back via sweden the following week i called cc and asked for reimbursement for the cancelled return journey it was completely problemfree and i had the money in my account after days great service thank you it would be nice if the colourline office had been open on the weekend too so that we could call to inquire whether and when certain departures were taking place or were cancelled
three passengers travel together by car and are placed by colorline in different random places on the ferry larvikhirtshals even if the places have been bought as part of the car package calls ticket service who say they cant help but that we have to try to change when we get on board customer focus at colorline
we went on the mini cruise the room on board could have been cleaner crumbs from the previous user otherwise everything about the stay on board was ok only the communication via email with colorline was a solid quotquot i sent colorline an email four weeks before departure but it has remained unanswered to this day colorline probably doesnt give a damn about customer inquiries
our minicruise has been part of our baltic sea vacation for years it is a very nice tour on a very nice ship but with steadily decreasing performance the price remains stable or even increases as if the price wasnt enough of a disadvantage for germans norwegian guests have been increasingly favored for several years what a shame even when booking hotline you realize that you are not welcome a ritual that has been prevalent since has now come to an end this was our last trip with colorline
have had several trips with color line before and have been very satisfied but now it seems that things have changed had a trip now in june and was incredibly dissatisfied surly service have to book everything you want to participate in and wait in long queues to get food the freedom these trips gave passengers before is no longer there everything should be booked in advance no it will probably be a while until the next trip
we were travelling with a travel company due to a car accident police car we were stuck in a traffic jam on the motorway for hours the colorline captain waited for us for minutes before setting off from kiel to oslo that was just great thanks again to the captain have a safe journey
i had booked a trip from hirtshals to kristiansand with colorline as i wanted to book an additional service buffet i called the booking hotline as the attempted internet booking for whatever reason did not work after more than an hour of recorded messages telling me to be patient all employees were busy i decided to accept the callback offer that was on the morning of july i am still waiting for the callback july pm conclusion the company obviously has no competition otherwise this disastrous customer treatment would be unthinkable recommendation if you do not want to be annoyed avoid this shipping company
color line shows no leniency if you miss the ferry through no fault of your own there is no emergency service at the weekend so rebooking is impossible i will report on other shortcomings in detail elsewhere
we traveled with color magik to kiel a nice boat but lack of customer service in the great restaurant at the back of the boat where we ate rude waiter dry baguettes as a small snack for nok at relatively high prices on board compared to other ferries in foreign traffic i have inquired with acquaintances and they were very pleased with the trip and the offer but they traveled on a whim does not tempt repetition
extremely bad customer service its now taking days to process an email booking and we wanted to leave in days so the booking and the trip are no longer valid unfortunately not advisable update still havent received a reply i think theyd rather charge the euro telephone booking fee if you can get through there was no call back either
at the beginning of june i canceled our ferry crossing because it was not certain whether we would be allowed to start our trip in midjune it was all too uncertain for me and since we had booked the additional flextarif service free of charge we decided to cancel i simply wrote an email to the company which was confirmed within minutes however due to the workload due to covid they asked for up to weeks to refund the money after just weeks i had all of my money back in my account without having to worry about it any further so top service despite the pandemic
we tried booking online several times but always ended up with an error message we will probably have to look for another holiday destination especially since the competition is not operating on the dates we had planned to travel
i am a bus driver and after sailing the trip hirtshals larvik and back i am left with a sense of wonder at experiencing discrimination on board discrimination is that truck drivers have the opportunity to lie down and rest but bus drivers do not both cargo and bus drivers are subject to the same driving and rest time rules so i am very surprised that the crew on the ferries make such discrimination otherwise a nice crossing with a nice buffet and good opportunities for a bit of shopping question for you color line what makes you discriminate against truck and bus drivers
attention to future customers at color line when you think you are booking a crossing with color line you should know that it is aferry that takes care of the finances and it is completely impossible to get through to get any money back in case of cancellation even within the right time for cancellation still waiting for our money dkk canceled ferry departure hours before from larvik to hirtshals due to flooding in norway just have to mention that we have traveled with color line many times but are strongly considering whether we should continue to travel with them again
went to norway last christmas outward journey hours of waiting in line for the corona test why no extra staff you know how many people you are going to transport return trip hours before departure we received an email that the boat was not going we were already on our way so hotel etc you will not be helped by colorline complaint we have not received a response to the email for reimbursement of the costs incurred after a week only the automatic confirmation of receipt calling colorline takes a lot of time if you dare
despite many references to the quotflex tariffquot with free cancellation or rebooking up to hours before travel this cannot be selected as stated in the information unfortunately it is not immediately apparent that this was not booked but only via the online portal and not via the travel confirmation it is also unsatisfactory that you do not receive a response via the contact form and cannot reach anyone by phone unfortunately this leaves so much uncertainty and dissatisfaction
i have been very happy with colorline so far i have been traveling to norway for years and i have no complaints a refund or rebooking due to corona worked perfectly and if you want to go on a cruise you can of course do that but you should make some compromises compared to a normal cruise as it is also a cargo ship that should be taken into account
booked a trip for a family member and it was both easy to do on your own and they report that it was a very successful trip that they hope to have more of i also think it raises the issue that changes can be made without incurring a fee very happy with everything
our trip is still to come and im already incredibly annoyed i wanted to make a change to the height of the vehicle and suddenly the whole trip was cancelled i was on hold on the hotline for ages i couldnt get through this will be the first and last time we travel with colorline
rarely have we experienced such a disorganized business they made us sit in the blazing sun for hours a youth camp with young people team and then told us we werent going on the ship everything was booked correctly in advance weve never experienced anything like that before how callous people can be better to leave it and find another provider
what a damn rubbish scheme was going to book a prechristmas trip for me and the lady and called customer service to get some general information on something before booking the trip first of all it was days before i got to speak to someone and when they first answered the phone it was an unbearable lady who was rude didnt want to answer questions and said everything was on the internet even though i checked that there were a few things one i did not believe and wondered about before possibly ordering worst service i have been attended to ended up not being a good trip and will spend all my time writing bad reviews
i tried to rebook a departure that was supposed to take place in days on a friday after pm the new date was supposed to be the monday after the weekend at am the problem the hotline is only available monday to friday from am to pm according to the automated response a rebooking will be processed within working days the response to this cancellation of the booking was answered with the same text processing within working days i canceled flex tariff and rebooked after the hotline resumed its work i received different emails from different employees to each of which i replied that i had canceled and rebooked in the last email i was asked whether i wanted to keep my booking or rebook if that isnt chaos apart from that boarding was also a bit disorganized
unfortunately everything has to be paid for extra and the information is either hidden or somewhat misleading a good example of this is that we booked a hotel with a pool through color line after we arrived at the hotel and wanted to use the pool for hours we were told that the pool would cost another euros per person for one use this was of course much too expensive for a pool of this size very small pool and was very disappointing with the ships themselves if you book for people for example the cabins are not even made up for the third person we had to take the bed out ourselves and unfortunately there was no bed linen to be found so generally speaking for this price it is simply poor value for money
its smart enough to set up a mobile network with roaming prices of dkk per mb of course you only find out after the ferry has sailed and the door to the car deck is locked it thus costs easily dkk to have two phones lying in the glove compartment during the crossing now get into the game theres no one paying those sums in its an advanced tricktheft
the trip was to be rebooked i called the german and norwegian hotlines countless times after long waits the calls were never answered the promised call back has not yet happened neither from the german nor the norwegian hotline there was also no response to an email thank you very much now i have had no chance to see my family despite efforts to rebook early regarding the cabins cleaning was more than inadequate on both crossings within a few days the cabins were not cleaned adequately the floors were dirty and guests tissues were lying around in front of them after all you pay not a small amount for the crossings otherwise it is bearable for one night i found the staff on board and on the ground to be friendly
it was about the refund of the advance payment for a canceled trip the amount was supposedly transferred to me on february after various emails and threats to seek legal help i finally received the refund in my account on february my conclusion never book a trip with colorline again
a very long wait to get on the ferry with the car over hours of waiting and time and time again other cars were late and were let ahead absolutely badly organized only one terminal was open
we have been waiting for a response for weeks our emails are not being answered a service desert like no other if these people were as amateurish in navigating customer enquiries as they are in handling them we would never have come to norway anyway
when i received the ticket for my journey to larvik i sent an email to customer service late last night about whether i had forgotten to include a car the very next day i received a new ticket with a car and settlement against the amount paid
after being abused by fjordline and their captain on we got a trip with colorline in the afternoon instead and it went completely according to plan both staff and ship lived up to expectations and when we now think of the terrifying return we had with fjordline on friday where we both witnessed the staff obviously drinking at work as a german tourist expressed it while eagerly photographing facebook and their smelly toilets colorlines boatfacilities are top notch compared to the smelly ones that were offered by the competitor the dutyfree prices and selection are also in a completely different class here
great service relaxed trip of course everyone can be critical we are not the trips were always relaxed dk viceversa no its a ferry not a cruise ship and the service was always good to very good even the telephone service we had to rebook the outbound trip for this summer everything worked out within minutes and the man on the hotline was very friendly and super helpful anytime and always happy to go again
color line is a lot of fun it looks like a small town inside the ferry show is absolutely fantastic last time we were in the show was shorter because of corona so i hope they are back in full force now the club on deck i think was a bit scary when i was younger because of the things that i dont know the name of they also have a water park there very fun the best is probably shopping there are some shops there and last but not least tax free love that shop so i could leave at any time again
incomprehensible how you can arrive hours before departure and get on the ferry as one of the last with less than minutes to go
unfortunately had to cancel a trip with superspeed long queue on the phone but all you had to do was leave a phone number and they called back within hour and the cancellation was no problem
an incredibly miserable shipping company when the buffet is full you just remove the drivers they dont care about that shipping company i would recommend that you avoid sailing with color line and i would never go on holiday with them
always on time can book the day in advance if the holland norway line decides not to sail again friendly staff and never had any problems
when you go to sandefjord to get help and rebook a ticket to dk when color line has crashed in hirtshals and getting hold of people on the phone is completely hopeless as everything is closed and he hadnt received mail or that the boat didnt work we read about that in the newspaper meet the grumpy lady at the counter who claims that it wasnt color lines fault that the danes we visited didnt come home and wasnt helpful with rebooking from kristiansand until another lady came and said now you do this and that yes he got a bill home but the last thing she said she could have saved herself now you have got the papers for the trip so now you can go so i can continue with what i was holding on me thats not what i call either customer friendly or customer service so you really shouldnt have anyone with customers and do is my opinion
we have already traveled with colorline over times several times with a few days stay in oslo as well as mini cruises i cant really understand the negative reviews we were always very satisfied regarding the missing information about the cabin which someone complained about when i book a cabin i find out about the services they are listed in detail in the cabin descriptionsit is definitely not true that quotallquot norwegian guests are allowed on board earlier only if they have booked a mini cruise can they return to the ship in kiel at any time after going ashore just like we can in oslo our trip was also canceled in cl offered different options we had decided to cancel days later the money was refundedthe employees in the hotline at checkin and on board are always helpful and friendly we are very satisfied with the service and the food i cant say anything about trips during corona we didnt travel during that time but what must be taken into account norwegian corona rules apply on board and when leaving the ships in oslo and boarding
colorline seems to have no corona rules and they dont apply there is no checking of vaccination records in either kiel or oslo there are also hygiene rules cleaning of the ship regarding the stair railings or door handles disinfect very disappointing
at the beginning of the year we booked the hirtshalskristiansand and back larvikhirtshals connection for both of us our dog and our rv due to unclear instructions on taking animals with us i called color line and had them confirm that our dog cm tall and his crate could travel with us we have always done this with other shipping companies as our dog always sleeps in his crate about hours after departure an employee of the ship demanded that the animal be put in the car i refused this because several alarm systems were blaring on the car deck i was then locked in a cell with steel boxes and was not even taken out after the ship docked in this cell there were steel boxes in which terrified animals were locked up and had to lie shivering on the cold steel plates i also had to throw away the food i had just bought that was for the garbage can ultimately our dog was almost certainly so traumatized by this experience in rough seas and incredibly loud noises that we had to take him to the vet in norway the stress he experienced affected his gastrointestinal tract so that we ended up having to cut our vacation short and return early the vet costs in norway amounted to and so far here in germany they have only cost color line responded with an email that they assumed was a misunderstanding
we took the color line ferry from hirtsals to larvik on december nd and returned on january st it was already so full on december nd that not every passenger could find a seat for the hour crossing on january st however it was so bad that people had to lie and sit in all the aisles and on all the landings it is not only questionable for hygienic and pandemic reasons to overbook a ferry to such an extent safety is also not guaranteed with such a large number of people all of this is only accepted in order to make maximum profit i find it just pathetic i have always been satisfied with this ferry company so far but i will look elsewhere in the future thank you for nothing
now its quite special to travel with colorline you cant sit more than people together in the restaurants and no more than in the pub i was on the boat yesterday many people were frustrated as travelers who were turned away by both bartenders andthis is getting a little out of hand if you ask mewhen there were at the match at intility just a few kilometers away from where the boat departsso those rules about colorline now make it so that it is not pleasant to travel with pairs of friends and families are turned away oh at donkey bar and monkey bar there they are extreme so it wont be my turn at colorline until the whole damn covid ride is over
im pretty annoyed that we had to wait in oslo as guests who had already checked in they should have created a separate entrance at the side just leaving the ship took hours leaving the ship isnt worth it but i think its outrageous that it takes almost an hour to get back on the ship if i were to do this trip again i wouldnt leave the ship
unfortunately star is still too much ive been waiting for weeks for a refund for my booked trip no contact options only emails generated by the system
addressee colorline service center ferry crossing oslokiel on september th th obviously as a longtime colorline passenger who also got to know the predecessor ships princesse ragnhild and kronprins harald i am no longer even worth the minutes that are usually spent cleaning a cabin i found a dirty uncleaned cabin leftover dirt from previous users gummy bears bag straps lying around on the floor fingernails or toenails an unvacuumed dirty carpet and a nonfunctioning light that i repaired myself the attached photos only partially show the condition exposing a customer to such a condition is simply disgusting as a customer will i have to accept such services from colorline more often in the future kind regards markus bller unfortunately i cannot post the pictures of the cabin condition here on trustpilot
we are with a dog the animal costs around euros so a ferry of this size and class i advise everyone to take a different ferry times minutes and no thats not possible animals slip and i think they can injure themselves older people can also injure themselves when crossing never again a big minus
nice boats good entertainment and fantastic staff very long waiting time in the telephone queue but due to the extraordinary situation i will not let it affect my review
i have booked a ticket to hirtshals from larvik for adults and a car return at a later date everything looked fine until i paid for the tickets and then i received the confirmation by mail that there has been a technical error it says in the confirmation that the departure is from hirtshals and to larvik and it should be the other way around i dont understand how it can happen and your system can be so bad the next day i called customer service and waited for hours during their opening hours without an answer its completely stupid to have such a lousy booking system and the worst part is the call back they say that it will call back as soon as they have capacity and that it will keep the place in the queue but it never happened that they called back can anyone help
we sailed with colorline to hirtshals a few weeks ago and our little dog only years old was forced to sit in a smelly and small kennel where he was tossed left and right due to bad weather and high waves i went down and checked on it shortly after take off where it had been tossed around so much that it was now limping and howling in agony i took it with me to the reception and said that the dog was not going to stay in that kennel and was told that i could then put it down in the car where it could sit injured and alone i took the dog with me sat outside on the deck in meter wave height with the dog under my jacket freezing for several hours until we finally got ashore one of the dogs hind legs was sprained so she subsequently limped for a week colorlines whole disgusting attitude towards animal welfare is accompanied by the fact that i will never choose to travel with them again until they can create a section that all other ferry companies than colorline can obviously find out where you can sit inside with your dog because for example how hard can it be what does it take to create a section for those who bring a small pet with them
inhuman conditions a youth leisure group booked a ferry to norway during the night trip denmark was classified as a corona crisis area on arrival in hirtshals the young people and another childrens travel group were denied access to the ferry as a result the lines to germany were hot despite legal support and involvement of the german embassy in oslo color line did not want to provide any meaningful information it was obvious that the company had misinterpreted the norwegian governments instructions the groups were put off in the scorching heat in the ferry parking lot without further action with a reference to a later ferry toilets could not be used and drinks were not available after hours of delaying tactics the only option was to leave with exhausted and disappointed children and young people this review was written due to the insensitive and inhumane actions of color line
we looked at the round trip from kiel to oslo on december th online and were shown a price of for our selection since we wanted to clarify a booking beforehand we actually booked just one day later on december th now however we were shown a price that was higher so on december th and on december th a price of so within one day an increase of
i traveled with the color line last week and was disappointed the service is terrible especially for germans you feel like the fifth wheel and yet we are paying for our trip and the additional costs are not exactly a bargain but the ship is beautiful
first color line cancelled a trip to oslo with a hotel stay that had been booked many months ago and then you have to chase after the travel costs forever never ever again color line
we went on a mini cruise with one night in oslo there is nothing to complain about the ship however you have to know everything yourself in advance and not rely on customer service for example we did not know that if you book a cabin you get free wifi included when we asked on board we were only given the general prices then for the return journey we were told that we were considered returning passengers and could board from am so we left the hotel early only to have to wait until oh yes pm to get on board our inquiries were brushed off in an extremely unfriendly manner the time could have been used better we then observed that all norwegian travelers were allowed on the ship earlier i cannot imagine that they were all vips as most of the german guests simply did not get through this gives rise to the suspicion which has unfortunately been expressed many times here that norwegians treat german guests in particular as second class passengers overall it was very nice but the poor service is unfortunately the reason for the bad rating after all it wasnt cheap either on the next short trip well try out the competition
its just horrible im not allowed to travel from norway to sweden because i have a temporary german passport i flew to norway with it but i cant go to sweden why is sweden in the eu whats wrong with them
the mini cruise with a oneday stay in oslo was supposed to be a short break to relax from everyday life after many months of nonstop work but things started to go wrong right from the start on the colorline website the services offered can be selected individually then come the personal details this takes some time having finally finished this part the payment order follows eg by credit card all of this data is also entered and the entire booking process is completed a short time later the amount is deducted from the account what was missing however even after days was any confirmation of the booking process the money is debited and no confirmation a really queasy feeling arises then something unexpected happens the amount is refunded days later again no notification as to why the money was debited and then it is refunded again somewhat shocked by this i immediately go back to the pc and laboriously type in all the data again again the amount is debited a short time later again there is no confirmation email for the booking now i call straight away to ask why why nothing is working here there is also the option of making the booking by phone but it says that bookings by phone cost an extra euros what a nogo the email that followed said that colorline couldnt explain all of this absurdly colorline made the following suggestion they offered to make the booking by phone and i was supposed to give out my full credit card details over the phone i couldnt believe that im not giving out my details over the phone to anyone i made a third and final attempt this time using the company computer i finally got the confirmation email but how much money does the account have to have in order to be able to make a trip i cant hold three times the price so that the payment finally works theres no paypal here three attempts a lot of time wasted but colorline doesnt care there is also the option of making the booking by phone but it says that bookings by phone cost an extra euros what a nogo is that unfortunately the buffet was only lukewarm i wrote everything in detail but there arent enough characters here also the unfriendliness of one of the waiters but colorline also received this entire review via the booking portal its a shame given the limited space here
too many negative feedbacks here i look forward to traveling with colorline once in a while by car larvik hirtshals or cruise oslo kiel i always eat in the grand buffet in the evening or lunch if superspeed for years i have been dependent on driving a car and without colorline it would have been more difficult to get out the standard on colorline is very high compared to other ferries i have tried in the eu try the ferry from dovre to calais with worn out furniture and expensive inedible food or ferry from genoa palermo where i had to go to bed hungry due to lack of food if i travel on holiday with colorline i know that i probably wont find better food along the way in denmark germany italy france usually fast food or leftovers that not even the livestock will eat looking forward to christmas party colorline kiel many thanks for years of sailing colorline has many options so there are cabins and food for ordinary people and those with money
both ships are slowly getting old while color magic still makes a good impression fantasy looks rather unkempt on the outside inside the ships however everything is fine the cabin is adequate and clean we did not use the entertainment program if you like it prices are only shown in euros in the taxfree shop otherwise only in nok in any case the focus seems to be on scandinavian guests the waiters in the restaurant only speak an incomprehensible mixture of norwegian and whatever strange residues were found in a drink bottle we complained immediately and the bottle was removed and replaced with a new one probably out of fear that something else would come after but what are we supposed to do with a new drink we actually expected a refund and an apology but that is not usual for norwegians drinks have to be paid for separately anyway the american system is used here low wages which are supplemented by tips beverages are included in the price at stena color would be well advised to finally realise that a large proportion of passengers do not come from scandinavia and to train the staff better the taxfree shop is not worth it for germans far too expensive when checking out in oslo it is not advisable to queue up at the end there are only border policemen who look very closely at every passport from a noneu country this can take a while better to wait until the queue slowly dissolves checking in in oslo is quite unfriendly the food is apart from the service and the drinks and the lack of variety of rolls at the breakfast buffet quite good which is to be expected for the prices otherwise forget the small criticisms for now and enjoy the trip the signage in oslo is bad however if you want to go from the terminal into the city you should save yourself the taxi around nok euros it is better to go down the ramp and after about m is the bus station towards the center line tickets also available on the bus but cost more than via the app ruter price via the app nok on the bus as a ticket
in november of this year i did this tour with my friends it was ok but its a good way to see if you like this type of travel at all on board we made a big purchase and with it we received a voucher for a mini cruise kieloslokiel for four people free of charge which must be carried out between november st and march st with the exception of christmasholidays the booking period must be between november st and january st the crossing is free the food and activities on board must be paid for since my mother and her three sisters go away for a few days every year we wanted to let them take care of the trip and give them the food activities when i wanted to book i first selected the desired period march and adjusted the food activities when i then entered the booking code the desired travel period was suddenly no longer bookable at first i assumed that there was a problem with the online booking so i contacted the booking hotline by phone i told the lady the same travel period as when booking online no problem the travel period was still available we went through everything together everything was fine and then finally i gave the lady my booking code then suddenly the same problem arose this travel period is no longer available the lady on the phone told me that i should choose a different travel period however a trip with this booking code is not available for the whole of march although otherwise there is actually capacity conclusion you are being duped with some kind of voucher disappointing then you shouldnt hand out such vouchers if they cannot be used anyway or only certain dates are possible and these are specified the customer hotline was not particularly friendly or helpful and lost a customer because of this behavior
there have been many nice trips on magic and fantasy in recent years the boats generally have pleasant employees good employees who seem to be proud of their work there are some who have worked there for many many years really a good sign little replacement in particular the spa department and the catering facilities at the back of the boats tend to give a few extra stars in the book the materials and the quality of the interior are of good quality but beginning to need modernisationrefreshing the boats are years old its fine to take it as a harry trip with friends what pulls down a lot has nothing to do with the boats themselves customer service on the phone is a disaster which i think many people are extremely annoyed by it just keeps getting worse and worse they expect people to fix themselves online that part of the infrastructure is totally out of date and is probably scared away by error messages and other strange events there is a bitterness that comes with the journey hope they address this fixed inventory etc
on july colorline stopped the ferry service from kristiansand to hirtshals at pm on its own initiative citing technical problems my family received an email on july at pm i read this email after arriving in kristiansand the onsite staff was unwilling to help organize hotel accommodation other ferries simply could not be reached on time a crosscountry trip through sweden and denmark by car of over hours of pure travel time with two children and was not an alternative colorline automatically rebooked me on the next ferry at am the following day after a twohour search on site i was able to find a hotel room in kristiansand expensive prices on a saturday in this almost fully booked city on the afternoon of august nd i finally got the service on the phone who told me that colorline would not reimburse any costs for the stay quotit says so herequot the fact that you cant seriously want such bad contractual behavior as an entrepreneur and that you cant treat people like that and that she is welcome to tell her company about it was taken by the service employee as an attack on her personality and defiantly suggested that i sue if only it had been possible to cancel on site to get the money for the ferry back yes of course that would have brought me home quickly what on earth is going on at colorline what on earth is going on there why is it so hard to get hold of the service why does the service only read out a response and not address the issue and why does the service still take so long why doesnt the website offer an easily accessible complaint option why are they simply not interested in the person who is simply left standing far away from home where has human decency gone in this company
to experience a company being so indifferent to its customers is frustrating i am norwegian married and live in norway this unfortunately means that i have to use colorline several times a year as i depend on taking my car to the motherland we are colorclub members in our household which is not recommended as the dice are clearly being rolled as to which members should get offers my parentsinlaw are also members but get far more offers than we do we want a pleasant and calm crossing which is so to speak impossible on their ferries we always buy business or airplane seats but the noise level in these departments is completely unacceptable at all times also i have contacted colorline several times because i wonder why they never check the authorization to stay on the deck with the airplane seats the answer from colorline every time is that they rarely do that but i have never experienced it in the approx crossings i have had in the last years i have also approached more than a few times with my surprise that on a ferry with a capacity of ic trainsets they fail to create a quiet zone for the travelers who want it i have been met with indifference every time in addition the nosy and rarely service minded staff last time i traveled on business my boarding pass would not activate the compartment lock i approached customer service on deck and was given a new boarding pass but not without the accusation that i had ruined it and had to take better care of the new one these are just a few examples my recommendation is therefore if you need a car in denmark fly down and rent a car we often do or if there is good time drive to oslo and take the stena line or drive all the way across sweden
the boat left minutes before the time so did not come havent taken it in a long time but i had to be reminded why terrible customer service
traveled with magic and primarily as a ferry between oslo and kiel it is very good the cabin is comfortable with a tv and bathroom a fridge in the cabin is also a good thing it invites you to bring your own lunch which you save money on as a cl milk costs nok on board the pub is not open very long so it is early evening authoritarian arrangement where you are chased into bed color line could do something with that casino is experienced as fake with rigged slot machines passengers who are wanted and liked in that they leave money everywhere on the ship win money while the average middle class loses all the time do not recommend anyone to lose money here if you shop for over in tax free you get double free tickets to try against customs others get nothing you have to wait minutes in norway before you are allowed to disembark but it is because of the polices passport control as if the german police have not already checked it it is beyond the shipping companys control but it is an uncomfortably long wait the cafe on board is then closed and the chairs unusable for older people otherwise it is cozy and a good offer for ordinary people
sandefjord strmstad today prebooked trip over a week before comes almost last on the boat because the tall man who assessed the height of the car that he towered over seemed terribly tall they are working on placing cars and the height was given in order was supposed to be a nice prechristmas family trip and the only free space was in a very busy staircase right next to a smelly toilet totally oversold boat and greedy exploitation of the fact that by licking the right people up the back they have got rid of the competitor fjordline which was a significantly better boat in many ways and not least free we felt more deported than welcomed and also had to pay approx for a near horror experience there were many people on board with the same experience we were far from alone on the stairs it is also highly questionable that a captainmate is more concerned with picking up a receipt from the floor than keeping the escape route clear which actually happened and he had to maneuver between people sitting in the way in the stairs after the heroic receiptpicking this cannot possibly meet security requirements in the event of a fire for example this would be completely behind the mark the same way the norwaysweden ferry service goes
i booked a return trip to oslokiel with my loved one actually for but had to postpone it twice because of you know what i mean but it was no problem thanks to the automatically offered flex tariff it was understandably a bit difficult by phone due to the high volume but it was really easy by email late days later the rebookings were fixed so the trip started at the end of august and a few days later after successfully surviving a week of hiking i returned checking in was no problem either time i couldnt tell that norwegians were given any preference or anything like that and i didnt see any real vips or didnt recognize them maybe they were all in costume or something the waiting time wasnt really long a little tip you dont necessarily have to be there at pm sharp if you arrive a little later the waiting time is correspondingly shorter it was very pleasing that the ships were relatively empty due to the late time of year ie instead of parking in uncomfortable tight rows of four we were shown to spacious rows of three that was good no crowds of people dragging their luggage etc along parked cars when they have to park relatively close together due to a large crowd so the ships were otherwise pleasantly empty the cabin was ok inside cabin with bed for totally sufficient bed is wide enough the choice of cabins is large enough if you absolutely need a sea view for one night you can have one it just costs a little extra i didnt see any alleged bed bugs as someone wrote before a quotnonluxury cabinquot like that is perfectly fine for one night but the show now costs from euros it used to be free well i dont need that one downside is of course the prices on board eating out is not comparable to eating out in germany but you are not forbidden to feed yourself in some way it is up to each individual the breakfast buffet on board currently euros per person is something you should treat yourself to it is really great and means eating until you drop without any restrictions especially in combination with the possibly cancelled dinner beforehand after that you can roll off the ship well to very well fortified the excellent breakfast should last you for some time actually the crossing on such a floating palace is an experience in itself at least if you dont do it regularly or often when you leave you go on deck and watch the spectacle outside and let the wind blow around your nose unless the weather is too bad the departure from the oslofjord is particularly great to watch and when you are far out at sea you go in and pass the time with all the things on offer i think its good i would do it again
great boats and top service and facilities incl show
i traveled with grandchildren three children two sonsinlaw and my partner on a quotcruisequot from oslo to kiel with color magic october the purpose was to mark my upcoming th birthday it was a nice trip the cabins were nice and clean the food was great the staff in the restaurants we used were all competent and pleasant but the trip was somewhat ruined by a noisy and drunken group who settled down in the corridor outside where our two youngest grandchildren had gone to sleep when my son went out to ask them to calm down he had a lot of bad words thrown at him and it was about to become an agitated and dangerous situation one of my grandchildren who is years old experienced this and was very scared couldnt get to sleep immediately after the incident my other son contacted the reception on board and guards arrived relatively quickly and helped resolve the situation nevertheless the stage contributed to our good mood being somewhat ruined it didnt get any better when my eldest son when he was with four children in the swimming pool was robbed of his new trainers worth almost nok the staff at the bathing complex helped him search but the reception seemed disinterested when he reported the theft to them i see that colorline can hardly be blamed for the fact that among the passengers there are rude and excessively drunk people and thieves however there is reason to warn other families with small children that they must be prepared for such experiences on a large boat
thank you for letting us use the toilet but not on the ferry lt kiss
flex ticket ordered a flex ticket when i was going on summer holiday wanted to go home earlier but when we had to contact customer service to use the quotflex ticket optionquot customer service was closed because customer service is only open until weekdays and satsun may i ask what kind of service it is we live in a world today where people expect service and answers to their questions so its no use saying quotour customer service has now closedquot enter the fight color line after all one buys a quotflexquot service to be flexible but as i understand it color line must have the ability to manage passengers as it suits them may i ask what is the point of paying an extra amount to have it flexible its pure trickery on the internet you can only buy a ticket no other possibilities why on the internet page quotview and change my journeyquot can i ask what and which function quotview and change my journeyquot should work as one cannot quotchange my journeyquot so what is it for then for decoration or is it perhaps under development the only things that can be changed are trifles the little services you offer dont mean a lot in the big picture because its the journey as a whole that matters ie the ticket customer service when you call customer service you are always met with quotmany people call us you will be served soonquot if you want to be called back you can press for us to call you back how long does it take before you get a call back not hour but almost hours and by that time the boat has left and when you finally get through to customer service there is usually a person sitting there who cant do a thing apart from chattering along as far as i know color line depends on passengers to operate its ships and to get few passengers you have to provide service but with this attitude color line begins to undress more and more hope more shipping companies take up the fight to be able to sail these lines so that color line knows what passengers mean and has to start tightening their helmets overall a crappy experience
a company that has really lost its way it all started with quotmy pagesquot failing to pick up my journey which meant that i couldnt preorder either dinner or the show tried to get help via mail and phone but the phone queue is over an hour long and they only called back after days when i was actually on board the boat when i got on board it was too late to book also the fact that they charge for prebooking a table for a minute show is totally ridiculous it wasnt like that before covid but they have chosen to continue it simply because they have made a lot of money from it explained the situation with quotmy pagesquot but got zero understanding and still had to stand in long queues and pay much more than if i could have prebooked everything costs extra it is already expensive enough to travel with color line now they have become petty as well show nok per table for people badeland charges for booking wifi swindyrt travels a lot due to work ive never come across either a plane or a hotel that doesnt offer this for free buffet nok per person for dinner breakfast per person for breakfast half fireplace for children by the way asked to get a glass of water with the coffee had to buy a bottle was argued for a glass of water when i proved that i had bought coffee games room for the children nok per game playroom for the little ones all the toys and lego had been taken away because it was not high season it was this whitsun weekend teen disco closed because it was not high season playroom on the th floor closed as it was not high season the gaming room no longer takes cash or cards have to top up a wristband at the reception which works of the time charge twice due to many mistakes and they dont refund the remaining amount if you top up for more than you have played for the breakfast was also bad they cleared away half the food an hour before the service closed the service is generally bad on board never met so many grumpy service staff ever apart from a nice lady who works in the showroom and a super guy in the perfumery got slammed by the lady working in the show lounge bar because my two year old son took off his shoes is moment got scolded by the restaurant staff at breakfast today because i brought a coffee and crossaint out you are not allowed to bring food from the buffet and had then paid for breakfast for two adults and two children ran into the water park with my twoyearold who really needed to go to the bathroom asked nicely to be allowed to come in and borrow a toilet for him but got a sour message that the toilet was only for those who used the water park after all it could be that i was going to sneak in casino has started to close at in the evening we were almost thrown out of both the restaurant and the show slammed by the man at the bar when i ordered another drink minutes before the show ok ill make your drink but you have to take it with you were closing with his index finger in my face several of the employees were simply rude and rude i have many good childhood memories with color line i have also had many nice trips with both magic and fantasy in the past this will be the last time it gave the impression of a boat where they squeeze in as much as possible in a short time give employees a lot of stress because there are far too few angry employees who are fed up with their jobs and a boat that squeezes you for money in every way they can we had a great trip but only because we simply decided not to let them ruin our weekend and made the best of it with the kids gives a two only because the cabin is clean and nice
great service got desired cabin type spacious and clean really skilled and competent waiter and perfectly prepared evening dinner everything lived up to expectations at crown as usual it is sad however that dfds has now been sold to a swedish company
i was generally happy with the crossing but what didnt work out well was parking my camper on the car deck the first time i parked i was directed to park so close to the wall that i couldnt get my dog out of the car only after asking repeatedly and reparking on my own was i unfortunately able to solve the problem myself
our early arrival at each terminal enabled us to get an earlier crossing both outward and return this made both our onward journey to sw france and our drive home better with regards to traffic conditions
everything was just good super reception at the ferry buffet with really serviceminded staff the same with the reception who were smiling and welcoming then there are the prices on board coffee drinks etc which are reasonable and far from copenhagen prices can definitely recommend dfds pearl seaways which is worth every star
due to circumstances we had to return earlier tried to book the evening before but you were impossible to reach therefore forced to book on the day of departure despite having already paid for the return we still had to pay an extra euros the boat was only half full dfds does take advantage of unexpected circumstanses not customer friendly
perfect trip there was a delay on the outward journey due to the bank holiday on the english side on the way back we managed to take the previous ship we booked no problem
boarding and disembarking very slick lovely to have incentives when buying duty free to get a free day trip however we spent over the threshold to get both a free day trip and off but did this over two transactions when asked whether we could access this the df staff wouldnt honour as we had two receipts so felt a little disappointed with this the breakfast full english was awful tasteless not very warm and a lot of money for what you received i saw many people order this and many plates had considerable food left which speaks that the food is not up to good standard
everything was organised and professional with helpful and friendly crew easy connections lovely food and plenty to do to pass the time ship was clean and comfortable well signposted and staff were helpful cabin was small but clean with good shower and comfortable bunk beds buffet was excellent with good variety and all freshly prepared ship had several bars cafes and games room for children disembarking and onward travel to amsterdam from ijmuiden was easy with coach transport provided for the approx min journey would say the duty free shop was overpriced but that is to be expected thank you for the great experience we had and to all the staff specially to gibson alex oliver and christopher arca
both sailings were hassle free although both departures were around mins late even though the dunkirk service had very few cars and passengers mainly freight return ferry was newer than the outbound one but both were clean and tidy plus all staff friendly and helpful just a pity that booking direct was not the cheapest option
outbound car damaged by incompetent marshalling inbound i had to refuse to be parked in a narrow deck where neither my wife nor i could get out of the car i was travellingcommodore de luxe at c otherwise on board staff excellent and sympathised with my experience gone are the days when commodore pax enjoyed preferential parking very poor show about which i shall tell any who ask me
like dfds aura ship dislike why always have to leave the cabin h prior to arrival for changing the beds leave the cabins and then sit h somewhere waiting to get to your car absurd also wifi you buy wifi but it either does not work or work very slowly also directions no directions at all when geeting on the ferry in the ferry and leaving the ferry no personnel that give you advices where to go
everything went very smoothly on both sailings booked the quiet lounge and were very happy with the experience lounge staff were excellent very attentive and looked after us very well
we booked a commodore class cabin for a mini cruise to amsterdam along with three course dining in the north sea bistro the accommodation was excellent and included free wifi and a free minibar the dedicated restaurant was very comfortable and welcoming with a calm unhurried atmosphere that was greatly appreciated one of our party was coeliac and vegetarian and there were no main course choices on the menu that directly matched these requirements however the staff worked very hard to prepare something each evening off menu that was acceptable the other choices on the menu were good and the food was well prepared and delicious breakfasts were also excellent the staff on the ship were extremely pleasant and professional and the ship was very clean and well looked after this resulted in us having a very enjoyable mini break that we intend to repeat later this year the only possible area of improvement was the transfer service between ijmuiden and amsterdam there were no issues at all with the service going from ijmuiden to amsterdam however we were told that the return service would leave from the exact same spot at which the bus dropped us at no dfds coach or other coach bearing dfds signage arrived at we had been waiting at the pickup point since the coach we did eventually pick up which was a dfds coach arrived at and turned out to be the coach it started picking passengers up from the other side of the road necessitating quite a few of us having to cross a very busy road to reach it it then drove to the coach turnaround point and drove directly past the place where we had all been waiting in the first place it would not take much to make this service better ensure that coaches are clearly marked as dfds and make sure that coaches pick up on the river side of the road
the whole trip is wonderful except the terrible bus service between newcastle railway station and the ferry terminal the bus company provide totally inadequate double decker buses from their urban fleet they have no aircon absolutely zero luggage space are noisy and very uncomfortable they dont depart until they have a full load so there is luggage everywhere including on seats and on laps some has to be carried upstairs not easy this is in b direct contrast to the bus service from ijmuiden to amsterdam which is superb and compliments the high standards of dfds the newcastle bus company have been providing this poor service for many years and seem to have no wish to improve things today even the bus driver said that it was no bus for this type of service as around of ferry passengers have luggage we need an appropriate bus
everything was great going there stars coming back was a nightmare we decided to come back a day earlier and turned up at pm for the midnight crossing because our year dog was being put to sleep the day we were meant sail because he had too many siestures the girl said we can get you on but it will cost you euros we said we dont have a euros when is the next availible free one she go round to the waiting carpark and comeback at am we slept on the carpark in our sleeping bags went round at am and a different girl said you can only get on it if you pay euros i asked to see her supervisor and she told us to go back to the carpark i went in and explained the girl had booked us on the am ferry for free instead of the pm scheduled he said no way you can get on it for euro i then said forget it and said when is the next availible free one and he said am him and his staff ruined a great holiday we also got our van ripped apart as customs i believe it was because i complained about what we were told to fob us off the first time the lady should have told us the truth and we would have got a air bb for the night her supervisor was a joke shame it totally damping a great holiday
everything was on schedule well organised a smooth trip all around the boat on the outward journey seemed a bit old and in need of a refresh or replacement but the returning boat was much nicer
during the crossing from dover to dunkirk on friday pm there were several buses with school children on board causing a lot of chaos and noise there was no corrective factor at all from the sharp staff nor from the people supervising these groups the result was that children tripped over my retracted legs several times and the sound volume was more like db this abundance of children left the ladies room in chaos upon arrival in dunkirk i understand very well that these inconveniences may have been caused by the large group of children but i have not seen anyone absolutely no one take corrective action which in my opinion should have happened we will not choose and recommend dfds first for a subsequent booking partly because i know what danish quality stands for and i am employed by a danish shipping company myself
the ferry was very punctual checking in was easy and unloading was also done quickly staff were friendly and helpful the program on board was varied and good unfortunately the cabin was very cramped this time and the shower was more than tiny
great service very accommodating with a short notice departure and very vert clean ships
arrived in ijmuiden this morning from newcastle with the princess seaways had a wonderful short holiday our cabin was fine as was the food everything was completely to your liking until this morning in ijmuiden the transfer to amsterdam went wrong we had booked this transfer well in advance but when we walked outside the bus intended for us to amsterdam turned out to be full how is that possible it got even worse we had to wait more than an hour and a half until a second bus finally arrived the lady who works at dfds and who initially spoke to us briefly had disappeared and so we were waiting all that time without information or apologies this can be better
we have once again been allocated a cabin on our crossing oslofrederikshavn which is located in an area with an unusually high noise level from the bardance area firstly we buy a cabin to rest and sleep after a long drive in norway and be fresh for the hour night drive from frederikshavn and home it seems to us that there are not many options for cabins on the sailing from oslo to frederikshavn i would like us as customers of frederikshavn to have more options regarding the choice of cabin
good organisation and we were allowed on an earlier ferry on our return journey which was great
i recently went on a minicruise kbhoslo and back to kbh it was a thoroughly good and lovely experience in every way just as i have known dfds for many years thank you i subsequently thought that it might be nice to have a christmas cruise on the same route ie to celebrate christmas on the boat i have done that once before and it was a really good experience dfds had made so much of it that one could only be happy and very satisfied in a real christmas mood now i have checked the dfds website regarding christmas cruise knowing that the route owner is then gotlandsbolaget and the offer may not be fully developed but i think there is one aspect you should be aware of everything about christmas cruise is aimed at and is addressed to families and couples nothing appears in relation to people who are alone and traveling alone in denmark percent of the population lives alone so here is an invitation to be aware of this matter as well see you again pearl seaways and crown seaways
friendly staff both at port and onboard worked efficiently to make an enjoyable start and end to our trip to le mans
it was not stated that this was a cabin where noise could be expected we were lying directly above the car deck and had two nights without sleep night number was so bad i didnt dare sleep this is the first trip in years with dfds and it will most likely be another years before another trip very scary and very disappointing otherwise the bus arrangement to and from the boat was surprisingly good on the boat we needed to bring ice cubes for the cabin cabin was hot and my daughter had a migraine to be able to get this we had to buy a bottle of water also from the bar you dont need this at color line they have their own records to take ice in so surprising that this was so strange you actually felt like a criminal just by asking
flixbus delayed for four hours due to port issues now have to rearrange onward journey due to late arrival costing more money
dover to dunkirk trip was fine return trip not so passport not stamped for return to uk dunkirk terminal depressing and soulless seats on ferry torn carpet dirty
the trip from oslo to frederikshavn was very relaxing the buffet was plentiful and very tasty the cabin was big enough and quiet the ferry crossing is recommended
i have very good experiences as a dfds customer they always go out of their way to give the best service can strongly recommend a trip on their beautiful ships
i was traveling serval times with dfds all in all it was always a pleasure on the ship the food the cabin the entertainment the only thing for me to criticise is the bus transfer in newcastle the bus is very uncomfortable and has to less space for luggage
i find dfds offer a more personal service than other cross channel ferry companies a good example of this is the welcome crew members give to passengers as they board a small gesture but it makes passengers feel valued the sailing schedule provides a good choice of departure times and the ships are well presented i have never been disappointed with the service from onboard facilities
super friendly and helpful staff flexible and free rebooking clean plenty of space minus one star for a freezing cold vessel and painfully slow boarding and disembarking
easy booking great service on board ship no complaints
ten out off ten for me the service we got from them is what you wont from a company lovely staff the boat was spotless and i would recommend the premium lounge
the english side was great and really helpfull they booked us on boat earlier but french side did not direct us to right lane for priority boardingwe had to arrange that with somebody durecting the cars on board she was very helpfull got us out of our lane and gave us priority on board everything was fine and everybody very friendly
departure and arrival on time friendly staff at all stations and levels prices in the dutyfree shop not attractive unfortunately free wifi is not offered dfds cant do anything about the rough seas from sunday to monday
i was disappointed the time in oslo has been reduced considerably
checking in and out and being escorted on board by car was very straightforward and the instructions were easy to follow the cabin was very good this time it was spacious and everything was there we slept very well the evening buffet is really very very good very tasty and there is something for everyone the same goes for breakfast the staff were all very friendly and helpful and quick i would be happy to travel with dfds again
easy boarding and exit from ferry welcoming and nice crew on board stable ship despite rough seas
delux room in boat with free internet and drinks
i cant book food on the cruise and the website is messed up in addition to this you must pay dkk to book online and dkk if you book by telephone why does it cost money to buy a ticket it is after all a hidden price increase in addition you must pay dkk extra in climate tax to the eu so at least dkk extra must be taken into account when you start booking
trip was ok booking was very poor as it does not allow adding passengers after the lead passenger
it was very cold where we sat in seats we had to get off the ferry through car tires not safe lots of exhaust
we usually have no issues but clearly we picked the wrong time to travel on th june at pm there were or coaches of school children on the ferry it was horrendous they practically took over running about shouting no consideration for any other passengers and there teachers were not bothered we understand everyone has the right to travel but it put a damper on the start of our holiday
managed to get an earlier ferry home staff all very friendly and the ferry was very clean
we were traveling with a baby and the car pushed us into the very bottom of the ferry from which we had to climb endless stairs to the cabin
best ferry company
sailings on time clean ship all went smoothly
the ferry was on time the cabin was clean and suitable and the buffet was perfect the crew was very friendly and good organized
it is what you expect the boat left in time to be able to find our way on the premises the staff was very clear and on board the crew was friendly
i was able to board an earlier ferry than planned trip very calm and a great english breakfast
the crossing went smoothly everything on time great cabin
all went well we were accepted to drive on the ferry although we were a littlelate
very nice and modern ferry friendly and helpful staff
spoilt by problems at both dover and calais
was booked on the but arrived very early am was allowed on the this was great as it saved me getting home in the early hours of sunday the morning would highly recommend dfds
you try to make a booking you select the cheapest crossing on the day you want to travel you try to pay for it and it says your payment has been refused you try again to pay and it says unfortunately the price has increased by do you wish to continue no you dont so you go back and select a different crossing on the same day that is showing as more expensive than the one you tried to buy but still cheaper than the increased price same thing happens again payment refused try again price has increased clearly the prices shown are not the prices you will be asked to pay whats going on and its not as if i just happened to try and pay at the exact same time the prices were being bumped up because when i started the process again from scratch on a different browser i was still initially shown the cheap prices that you cannot book you wasted half an hour or more of my day with this nonsense thankfully brittany ferries let you to book crossings at the price quoted which to my surprise tends to be less expensive than dfds all booked and confirmed in minutes including creating a new account thats how it should be i should have learned from my last experience with dfds when you triple charged my credit card but newhaven dieppe has been my regular route for over years and old habits die hard so i thought id give you another chance fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me never again
there were strikes at calais on our return journey but customer service could not have been more helpful in booking us an alternative everyone at dunkirk port was wonderful patient and very kind and calm despite all the extra people arriving due to changes
there is always a good atmosphere on board the ship you feel welcome even with children however i would like you to first sail back at pm it takes time to get off the ship and there is a short time in oslo
it was an excellent crossing for the price
on a grandmothers trip with fiveyearold grandchildren the experience is twofold after a nice trip to copenhagen in a commodore cabin we return with pearl seaways and enter ie almost do not enter in what is called an outside cabin with a small double bedquot i chose this one because i thought it vsr more favorable than bunk beds where is information that this bed of approx cm fills the room from wall to wall on three and a half sides also mention that most of it needs upgrading it is visible to everyone that most of it is completely out of date by the way the shuttle bus leaves at fortunately the bus was in place early could seat us but it was a different company ballerup than the bus from the port two days before viking many people got out and asked if they were on the wrong bus so the bus left before the time fine for us but there were some inquiring faces on the way to the stop waving at the driver
sailing tuesday dover dunkirk all toilets including invalid wc on deck were closed this is the rd time ive experienced this problem the pizzafood facility on deck also closed wheres your great services dfds
i was on the oslo boat tuesday wednesday thursday june i got sick at the pool probably got a bad feeling i passed out woke up with someone helping me i was a bit dazed and didnt know what had happened when i got up and sat i threw up up enough beaten behind the head patrick bubbelezone helped me coxswain anders helped and the doctor rosa helped me get down in the cabin i got light in my eyes and had my blood pressure taken it was as it should be and i was visited by rachid every half hour for a few hours and got bottles of water i had to didnt sleep due to perhaps a concussion and on wednesday at oclock mate anders came and knocked and asked how i was im fine after that and had breakfast and im also going out for a walk in oslo so you must finally say hello nice people who helped me many times and thank you very much for the help
easy site to make reservations on the way back we were hours earlier but it was easy to rebook pleasant crossing it was a shame that our two dogs were not allowed out of the camper
there was a fault with the water drainage system which took a long time to correct
we had originally booked from frederikshavn but it was cancelled due to a storm an hour later i got a call saying we could leave from copenhagen the next day at no extra cost we were happy to accept this as we got our own cabin instead of a recliner
hello trip as very nice but there is one that is very protective of peoples cars after the ferry i saw a new one being scratched
everything was good dfds are the best in my opinion nice staff clean ships good service will always use dfds
we have been travelling with our dog on many ships for years on the dunkirk dover route we were told for the first time that the dog had to stay in the vehicle we were escorted back to the vehicle like criminals only one was allowed to go the dog has now been sitting alone in the vehicle for hours we would never have booked this ship if it had been clearly stated after looking through all the terms and conditions of all the lines we found the relevant information for us that means never again using this company they call themselves for being animalfriendly
we sailed from calais to dover yesterday with dfds and felt i needed to say how nice it was to be greeted at the checkin booth by a smiling happy and professional french lady who couldnt have been more helpful she amended our booking whilst chatting and wished us a good day simple things but not always appreciated thank you and the rest of out journey was equally pleasant well done dfds
the trip with dfds is always a pleasure cabin with sea view lays the groundwork friendly serviceoriented staff across the board definitely a clear five
nice clear travel experience delighted holdup through customs control but everything else good
i had forgotten to stamp out sat on the boat to oslo and couldnt get to stamp my card got really good service when i contacted travel card by phone
arriving just minutes before the time of departure we were allowed on board the ferry although our reservation was for the next one two hours later
this was my first experience of cruising on a shop long distance dfds made this a pleasant one
from the arrival at the checkin at dover it was a very pleasant experience to be greeted by the dfds staffit was noted that we were accompanied by our dog wilf and given a goody bag with a collapsible drinks bowl and a bonio biscuit plus a leaflet explaining foreign travel with a dog
first of all the contact with dfds customer service was very good they were easily accessible and very customeroriented furthermore the entire crossing was tightly organised from checking in to finding your cabin there were employees everywhere to help you
always welcoming managed to arrange a quicker trip when early even when on a fixed timetable would recommend them to anyone
we were waiting four hours at the port km of lorries waiting to get to the port wont be travelling dfds again
fantastic experience smooth sailing literally we booked a last minute crossing due to missing a flight and it was so easy fast getting through both sides despite being school holidays ship was clean and had great facilities we did priority boarding which helped too
we were in a car waited at checkin in oslo it went ok but then we stayed in the blazing sun and waited hour and minutes for containers and semitrailers to be driven on board they were on shore and could have been loaded a long time before seems like bad planning there were no visible accidents no information this is not acceptable it says commodore cabins are ready we went on board after pm if this is practice so wait to start check in until pm or something like that write it down so you can plan it spoils an excellent trip
the ferry crossing itself was great we were given colouring packs for the kids the boat was clean with friendly staff and a good shop dfds was great but the experience was overwhelmingly let down by the awful queues through dover at the start of half term it took us over hours from entering the town to boarding the ferry we will choose a different route next time
thanks so much for your support during our journey from copenhagen to oslo my wife left her passport on board the shuttle before departure the crew and staff went out of their way to help and found the passport it was returned to us in oslo on the following ship the next day the crew saved our vacation and we are very grateful
we got through the customs much quicker than we thought once the cars were parked the ferry left right away and we disembarked in dover very quickly too in spite of the rough sea and stormy weather there were hardly any delays
very smooth trip both ways and kept us well informed also got us onto a ferry hours early on the way home without any issue thanks
we are absolutely delighted with the service on our crossing between ijmuiden and newcastle my husband has recently become disabled and is dependent on a wheelchair i was concerned about going on the longplanned trip anyway especially since we were unable to find an accessible cabin in which we could take our dog and the dog cabins can only be reached by stairs that was the only downside in this context what we then experienced was sensational the staff helped wherever they could we were allowed to park right next to the lift several helpers were ready and drove my husband in his wheelchair to the cabin shortly afterwards a manager came and offered us an accessible cabin in which we could take the dog this meant that we could easily reach everything with our wheelchair and we had a wonderful evening on the ferry the evening buffet is sensational you rarely experience anything like it an incredible selection and everything soooo delicious the breakfast is also great and we felt completely at home after docking in newcastle helpers came again without being asked to take my husband to the car simply wonderful and the crossing itself was a relaxing and unforgettable experience thanks to everyone recommendation for dfds
the people of dfds at the ticket gate were very friendly and helpfull especially when we returned there was a delay to duinkerken because of a medical issue they offered us a alternative trip to calais with po that went well
we offered parking by the lift which was perfect for my elderly mother even in the chaos of dover the dfds service was top class
excellent journey throught from newhaven to dieppe boarding and disembarking process was well done lost a star because the wcs were not well equipped in the ferry we went the door to the wc in the womens was not present and both the mens and womens toilets didnt have a functioning soap dispenser other than that i was very pleased with the process and will use dfds again
very enjoyable crossings both ways but on the return journey there was a hour delay in leaving dunkirk which was disappointing no idea why apart from this would sail again with dfds
all went well with the journeys except that the vessels were late on both the outgoing and incoming legs handling in the ports was fine and ships were clean
it was a good experience on board but its impossible to find on your website where to make arrangements for pet travel i had to go to the office in dover to pay for my dog second time this has happened
in april we tried the new ferry connection from dunkirk to rosslare in ireland due to bad weather the departure on the outward journey was postponed by about hours which we were informed of about hours in advance due to a shipyard stay of the dfds ferry quotoptima seawaysquot we had to make do with the replacement ship quotaf claudiaquot a somewhat aging ship from an italian shipping company a few hours before departure we received a call from dfds that the luxury cabin we had booked was not available and that we would have to make do with a regular bed outside cabin we had no other choice and agreed the price difference was to be refunded to us which actually happened at very short notice the replacement ship quotaf claudiaquot presented itself to us as a bare and very spartan ship without any comfort the free food in the canteen was at the lowest snack bar level there was no continental breakfast i would have gladly paid for a slightly better meal but that was not available either we arrived in rosslare hours late exhausted on the return journey we had to travel on the unfortunate quotaf claudiaquot again this time we got the only quotcommodore cabinquot with luxury amenities on the ship a completely bare cabin with two bunk beds on each wall in the middle a double bed which only had a thin sheet as a blanket this cabin did not have the comfortable amenities that were advertised in the shipping companys advertisement the tv was unusable because it only showed italian programs the shower and toilet were in two smaller rooms in the cabin no shower gel or shampoo both rooms were very dirty the toilet smelled of urine the shower was dirty in the corners everything in the cabin looked dirty and worn i have traveled on various ferries to great britain and scandinavia many times but i have never experienced such a horrible ship with zero comfort and zero service why did dfds use such a ship i hope that the shipping company pays a little more attention to the quality of its ferry connections i wasnt expecting a luxury ferry here but what was promised in the advertisement could not be delivered i cannot recommend this ferry connection at all what a pity
booked a mini cruise newcastle to amsterdam on a deal everything was perfect we booked our breakfast and coach transfers at time of booking the cruise and everything went smoothly very well organised all transfers on time and great pick and drop off points entertainment on ferry really good and all staff were excellent from cleaners to captain would definitely recommend this mini cruise
i have only given you a star rating purely on your lack of customer service out of hours let me explain i booked a am crossing to dunkirk and checked my booking confirmation again before leaving home only to realise i booked the wrong day ie i had already missed the sailing that morning as you are uncontactable after pm by any means i had no choice but to amend my booking and pay another before i walked out of the door to catch the new am booking my fault entirely but why no customer service overnight when youre ferries are still in operation profit before service it seems the ferry crossing was good as usual although minutes late and the staff were lovely
the rooms have been clean and tidy that was the good thing the bad part was the car parking set up entering the ferry in newcastle we were forced to park the car allmost complete beside the wall so my wife couldnt leave the car through the door nor enter the car through the passengers door she had to climb out and in through the drivers door doing that with spine problems isnt very funny if this is your standart to get one or two more cars on the ferry it is a verry low standart
it was a fine well serviced trip
every time we travel with dfds we enjoy the friendly correct way we are directed to the boat and in the boat if we arrive much earlier than on our voucher we can choose to take a boat earlier without any problem we enjoy travelling on your ships where the personal is very ftiendly and helpfull thanks for your nice service
perfect sailing but the ladies toilets were dirty which was weird as the ferry was in dunkerque over an hour before we left port otherwise i was really happy
insane price difference i simply do not understand how dfds can find reasonableness in their clear price difference on the route kbhoslo and frederikshavnoslo same ship same date jun same number of guests same cabin same size car yes the only difference is the port of departure logically it should also be cheaper to travel a shorter distance and then the price price kbhoslo kr price frdh oslo kr difference kr
had a nightmare with weather and vehicle problems before the trip started dfds were fantastic and helped made the trip happen and smoothly thankyou all
we had booked for pm because we were so early we were allowed to join at pm
we travelled a from newcastleamsterdam and back on king seaways dfds could do better at getting people travelling by car with young children on and off the ship more efficiently on arrival at amsterdam we were stuck in an exhaust fume filled and very hot car deck for over an hour due to technical problems with two screaming children not a great start to our holiday the crossing itself was fine both ways and the standard cabins were as expected staff were courteous throughout buffet dinner is much too expensive on the return sailing there were several groups of youth football teams these youths were allowed to run feral by whoever was in charge of them presumably the people drinking beer in the stairwells the youths were running rampant through corridors banging on doors and having wrestling matches in the play area for under sixs staff told them to leave that area several times but they were ignored quite a few people commented on how annoying the youths were and it had a big negative impact on a journey that cost us several hundred pounds if dfds want us to return they need to ensure safe play areas for young children and quiet cabin corridors free from antisocial behaviour
easy bookingprocess dfds app works well good and clear information given about all procedures for us also very helpfull info was how to travel tofrom the ferry terminal in newcastle boarding and deboarding was very smooth easy and organised staff very friendly and helpfull diner buffet and breakfast good choice and good quality the cabin was fineclean and the shower worked well all in all we had a very good experience with dfds and felt safe on board
friendly staff at check in and on board check in process a bit cumbersome especially on the french side ferry leaving time slightly delayed but ok food choice moderate could do with more variation
the ferry been delayed h i know they
cabin had so much noise and vibrations that none of the three people in the cabin could sleep how can dfds offer cabins on deck without making customers aware of the violent noise and vibration level that comes with it possibly offering hearing protection etc pallet
as always nice and clean ferry from frederikshavn and to norway and danish staff
i was on a charoty bike ride from ireland to nordkapp when things did not go as planned i had to change my return trip big thank you to leanna in customer support what a true shining example of customer service the rooms on board are spotless but the buffetwow epic after days on the road i was really looking forward to tucking into that all staff on board are super helpful my only negative is the bike ramp onto the ship is dangerous when wet but there are plenty of staff around so just needed to take it handy
it should be easy to get water to drink at dinner time also other soft drinks should be included give the price this would be in line with what is provided on the po hill to rotterdam ferry
great staff excellent service nice clean boat
i have tried to book online ferry and hotel waste of time i arrive with all the information passport and everything and unfortunately error get your system in order
basically we got from dunkirk to dover without any problems unfortunately the ship was an hour late and looks unkempt emergency supports can be seen on the open deck which are obviously protecting the paneling from falling the upper open decks were closed the handle on one of the doors to the outside was broken so the door remained open the whole trip are new ships in the works
endless waiting no way of knowing when things will continue we stand in the roundabout in front of the ferry entrance for two hours our ferry is supposed to leave at pm we were there on time but nothing is moving now it is already pm and absolutely nothing is happening here we have a timebound ticket it is uncertain whether we will get to france today there is no sign of any organization here now all we need is to hear that our ticket has expired
seamless checking in procedure all staff were very professional and helpful both at the port and on board well definitely use dfds again for our next trip and would highly recommend dfds to our friends and family
departure and arrival on time friendly and helpfull people at the reception in the harbour and on the boat
the ferry quotreginaquot is in poor condition the cabins are not cleaned the refrigerator is full of garbage the employee in the car department didnt react at all to the baby sign we had even though we showed it but he basically continued to accept other cars because we were driving and then we learned from him a quotteslaquot brand car unethical comments poured in eg quothow can we drive such an unsafe car you cant let it on the upper deck like thisquot ps the car is manufactured in and has a full warranty and a history of its own that it is in perfect order and has not the slightest problem and the further employees eyeball quotdrive it to the basementquot we learned from him himself that it only works for several months on the dfds ferry and that while he was working quotteslaquot will categorically not be on the top floorquot so if you have a baby with this ferry i do not recommend getting up because you will travel to the bottom and there are steep stairs that are completely unsafe and of course there is no elevator the price is too high for such a dirty and poor quality ferry we travel by ferries often but this ferry surprised me with the unethicalness and filthiness of its staff we traveled with this ferry half a year ago and there was never such a sight as now all the employees were benevolent and we were always on the upper deck when traveling on dfds ferries but not this time the attitude of the employee was more important this time than anything else we used quottallinkquot quotstena linequot quottt linequot ferries for almost years but we have never received such disrespect as now i wonder what will happen next will you allow your employees to continue to completely ignore customers
i have to say that traveling with dfds is just wonderful pleasant and great service good food there is something for everyone so i recommend everyone a trip with dfds
have used dfds twice now for holidays to france and theyve been very accommodating both times this time however our car broke down in france preventing us from using our original return ticket hayleigh from their newcastle office did a fantastic job of reassuring us and finding us a way home hayleigh explained afterwards that she was new but her level of professionalism and customer care didnt show that at all thank you
im switching to dfds from all the other ferry lines for sure service was on par ppl were friendly cabins were excellent i was traveling with a dog and while the cabin was awesome and the outside deck close theres also one downside theres nothing on the deck dogs could relieve themselves on other than just the regular deck material a small xm fake grass patch would go a long way all in all an excellent trip
dfds did what they were supposed to do plus even provided free of charge earlier sailings as i arrived early for my booked sailings thank you
car alarms in the hold we had to leave our dogs in the car and there was a lot of noise from the car alarms which seem to trigger each other sign posting around the port of calais not clear first time weve used the car ferry
the first thing id like to say is our outward journey was comparatively ok despite the discovery that despite having booked a disabled cabin the toilet was so low and the flush so inaccessible that i struggled to use it without pain and the door threshold into the toilet made it impossible to use my wheelchair apart from that though the check in and boarding were great and the consideration given to my disability was ideal our dinner in the north sea bistro was fantastic really excellent quality food however when i contacted customer services to see if the situation with the low toilet could be addressed i was told it would be over to upgrade to a commodore cabin but with none of my questions about heightaccessibility answered then came the return journey despite checking in in plenty of time our car was put on the rd level alongside mostly lorries where there is no flat access to the lift so i had to get out of my wheelchair to climb a step and stand waiting for a lift that took forever to come because of the number of people boarding this busy ferry all because the waiting area on that deck is not deep enough to accommodate a wheelchair by the time we were boarded i was already exhausted and needed to use the bathroom only i couldnt because what awaited us was a toilet stained with someone elses excrement not only a toilet that hadnt been cleaned but when my husband reported it to guest services they sent someone to address it without any cleaning products only a toilet brush it was little better when he finished and wouldnt fill or flush properly for the entire journey rather than an acceptable solution we were given a voucher for a drink with our dinner sadly one which didnt even cover the glass of wine my husband ordered but only water and my coke zero instead talk about a hollow gesture after paying nearly for an accessible cabin this is far below the standard we should be able to expect after we returned i took the time to write to dfds about this horrible experience their response im still waiting for an acknowledgement over three weeks on never again
service and customer focus from dfds was excellent the cabin was a bit noisy our neighbors went to bed late vibrations from the ship kept us from sleeping a bit
we are glad to have found a way to travel with your dfds ferries polite helpful service good luck to you
we travelled on po years ago and it was dreadfulwe dont travel to the uk often as we live in spain we decided to try dfds as cheaper than the shuttlewe were pleasantly surprised and will travel dgds again
overall i enjoyed my ferry trip it was great to have a dig friendly cabin i had buffet dinner and breakfast good selection of food available the only downside was i had to climb out my passenger door to exit my vehicle
missed the ferry because the gates closed early had to be booked onto a next one but h later
i liked the booking process online the information received ahead of traveling indicated that we could board two hours ahead of departure however when i arrived at checkin in copenhagen harbor which went very well a lot of motorcyclists were forced to wait on the tarmac in motorcycle clothing on a very very hot sun fort almost a full hour before we could drive onboard not good
in dover the french border control was unexpectedly very long i arrive two hours before departure unfortunately this time was not sufficient to get through french border controil i missed my ferry dfds booked me on another ferry to calais this was great many thanks for your understanding
easy check in friendly staff quick boarding and disembarking with bikes
for many years i have included a ferry trip on my vacation whenever possible and wherever possible with dfds because i have had good experiences with dfds so far consequently i booked my return trip on wed may st am to dunkirk with dnkirk seaways from the uk with dfds as well in retrospect however this turned out to be a mistake from a nautical safety and technical point of view everything was in order in my opinion however as far as passenger service on board was concerned it was more than inadequate and not just for me first of all there was basically no choice for breakfast just quotfull english breakfastquot or nothing at all if you ignore a foiled cold wrap with a shelf life of just until may st i cannot understand this as there were not a lot of english people on the ship but mainly truckers from poland and other eastern european countries so why not other dishes that can be prepared with little resources such as kraukauer bratwurst or bockwurst and the like the onboard shop also left a negative impression here i basically had to disturb the lady at the counter who was also the cashier so that she would interrupt her long phone conversation to collect my payment in conclusion you could book this ferry crossing online for under i had refrained from doing this because i had an uncertain arrival date in dover and because i had poor mobile payment options and relied on booking at the port however i was only able to book and pay there after the customs check in the dfds lane in the queue but then i didnt really have the option of turning back and no price was given in advance instead approx was suddenly charged and deducted i dare say that this is borderline inappropriate treatment
they were on time always and the vessel was cleani enjoyed the food and the shops tooi can say that the company is doing very well not forgetting the staffs on the ferry thank you
my main complint is that we were well over minutes late leaving dunkerque which caused me some problems for my onward journey otherwise the crossing was to the usual standard
i hereby award dfds star because you cannot give less poor service poor management got scolded when we checked in no toilet paper in the room bed not made when returning from a walk in oslo and the room was dirty our towels were thrown on the floor by the staff but not changed and then we go to reception to draw attention to this we are almost scolded and were told that but not for cleaning the cabin where we almost apologetically ask for toilet paper and new towels which the staff had thrown on the floor we stayed in a commodore class but with the money you put into such a trip i can only recommend a real cruise and not a quick trip to norway we have tried to contact the company but they just come back with that we are sorry so again no service stay away update again no consequence just that we are sorry still a lot of money has been spent on poor service had otherwise heard so much about the trip but can only say stay away save up a bit and take a real cruise
everything went to plan and delivery took place on the day we were told
we are very satisfied the crossing went perfectly with our son who is a wheelchair user everything was well organized and the staff was very friendly thank you only on the outward journey we had to wait a long time to board but for the rest its perfect
we traveled with dfds from ijmuiden to newcastle for the third time what a wonderful experience this is a wellrested start to your holiday in scotland is worth repeating
good arrangements pleased we could easily change crossing when arrived early more comfortable seating would be an improvement otherwise very satisfied
impressed by the condition and cleanliness of such a large vessel north sea bistro exceeded my expectations live music good but crossings are getting expensive
we actually missed our ferry because we failed to get there an hour before departure and were given a free transfer to p and o ferries that left only an hour and fifteen later
my husband and i have once again been extremely satisfied with dfds friendly and welcoming staff delicious food and sublime service for the past years we have gone with either pearl or crown seaways at least twice a year
its always a pleasure taking your ferry cheers thomas
the flexibility and offering of a boat earlier this saved us time
as i need to be parked by a lift to amsterdam was great on return could have been better on return loads of school children abusing the use of lift this makes it very difficult for those of us who have a disability and need the lift and sadly having to wait then long times with a lot of pain as result
boarding at dover was on time and very efficient staff on board very friendly and helpful i only had coffee and a pastry but both were excellent experience slightly spoiled by having to wait in my car for forty minutes before disembarking
staff always helpful but it is always frustrating when first the ferrry arrives late and secondly the disembarking process takes such a long time arriving dover minutes before it was possible to drive away returning to dunkirk late departure then the few cars on board were stored behind all the trucks when there was clearly space elsewhere as the ferry was not full result a minute delay disembarking plus further delays entering france as the cars were queued behind these trucks going through frontier controls not my best trip by dfds i suspect the ferry loading was done for the convenience of the boarding personal and not the travelling and paying cars and their passengers after the inadequate reply from dfds this is my further comment your reply states that delays to crossings may happen due to circumstances out of your control but this does not address my issue namely that circumstances within your staff control in this case the actual loading procedure could have been done in a way that allowed the few cars on board a speedy getaway
we liked the friendliness of the staff especially the service in the explorers kitchen getting on and off the ship quickly we didnt like our very loud cabin no annoying humming noises from the ships propulsion system there was rattling and banging everywhere in the cabin we had a quotshortquot and restless night what we learned the next time we book with dfds we will ask for a cabin on one of the upper decks on deck in our cabin we had an extremely high noise level which we have never experienced on any other ferry and as motorhome drivers we often use ferries in the mediterranean north sea and baltic sea
crossing dfds quotaura seawaysquot kiel klaipeda positive food fine beds good cabin was clean staff was friendly but english speaking very very poor negative checkin messy and not clear young man behind checkin counter customs friendly departure from kiel an hour and a half later than planned the german bundeswehr came with a lot of equipment these passed through the control gate in phases which took a lot of time the boat itself hardly any entertainment bare facilities in various public areas or tvs that showed various programs where the sound was very disturbing chairs in the lounge are bad too deep and bulky for the tables waiting staff also difficult to understand of the dishes offered on the menu were available outside deck it is a very spacious deck but hardly any seats such a pity
the boat seems to be getting very worn
the trip itself was great as usual however the bus on the way back was unable to get to the port and we had a bit of a trek to get back to get on the ship not the best when you have mobility issues
we had bought a de lux cabin with a sea view but half of the window on crown seaways gave a very poor view this was probably due to a socalled puncture of the window we were allocated the same cabin as on our previous trip in september also on that trip the window was damaged and we left a message about this in the cabin and can now find that dfds has not responded which is disappointing so therefore only stars for a trip that could have deserved everything else worked very well from end to end very friendly and competent crew in every respect
i had a great trip with dfds what dragged the experience down was how shabby our cabin was we had to choose an outside cabin with a window with two single beds the beds were molded after a long time of use you couldnt roll anywhere as you were lying in a hole in the bathroom there were notches in the sink in two places the toilet lid had a large peeling hole and in the wall by the toilet there were poorly patched holes and two unpatched holes the window frame was hanging down so it was uncertain whether the window stayed or fell out and the carpet was so worn that there was almost a hole all of this unfortunately dragged the experience down a lot tine rosenstrm north zealand
we were allowed on a early ferry that was about to depart just as we got to the waiting area everything onboard was clean and the staff were helpful
booking checkin and loading went very well the food the overnight stay and the crossing were very good and everything went smoothly friendly staff always served us well and helped us so full marks and we would be happy to come back we are looking forward to the return journey even though the holiday will already be over by then
the trip went well happy with the help provided for our disabled son with boarding and disembarking the only downside was the misuse of the elevator by a large group of young people which meant we had to wait a long time before we could return to the hut
we have already travelled to scotlandengland several times with dfds and have always had great experiences this time with cars our daughter her husband and dog the service was stars and everything else except for the cabin with people and a dog much too cramped too small and no fresh air it was unpleasantly stuffy and awful maybe we shouldnt have shared a cabin with people and a dog otherwise everything was very good as always greetings from scotland sonia and richard and family
what a fun crossing very clearly marked signage from the highway checkin at the counter from the car went very smoothly relatively short wait times before we could board on the boat itself there were several areas to comfortably make the crossing the possibility to have a meal duty free shopping extremely polite and helpful staff worth repeating
a left spot on time and we were able to catch an earlier ferry without charge
i was pleasantly surprised we arrived earlier than planned but were still processed and rebooked on an earlier ferry i thought that was perfect the staff were friendly and determined so i was completely satisfied
too expensive and tried to charge me euros to be put on the middle deck because i had a low car
the ferry trip with dfds from amsterdam to newcastle was an unforgettable experience everything worked perfectly friendly and very helpful staff the food was very good and there was a large selection our cabin was clean and we slept well the breakfast buffet was a dream we will come again with dfds
easy checkin nice clean boat
arrived early at dunkirk port dfds receptionist checked and kindly put us on an earlier departure than booked a short wait to load onto a recently refurbished ship very clean tidy in the dining lounge area considering its fast turn round at dunkirk on the outward journey a very decent lunch followed and arrived on time rested and well fed at dover speedy discharge of vehicles at dover great service thank you
everything was as booked a disabilityfriendly cabin both ferries were on time checkin was easy staff was very helpful and friendly all in all we had a good journey thank you
the whole trip was great staff all very polite accommodating special thanks to bar staff security for taking care of us security on our return through customs for pushing us through quickly to catch our connection
it is well arranged at dfds from beginning to end the cabins look good and clean have everything you need and there is plenty to do on board yesterday we saw the film june in the cinema a very nice experience in the morning you will be woken up in a friendly manner and you will immediately know what time the boat will dock we have already traveled to the uk with dfds several times and every time it has been taken care of down to the last detail
smooth trip and good facilities waiting time for car entry in vessel long and somewhat unorganized
been on many trips with dfds from copenhagen to oslo but never had better service from absolutely everyone and the two men who greeted us on board i copenhagen were outstanding kind and helpful
fabulous journey got there early so was kindly directed to an earlier p o ferry was a very smooth day trip to france and would definitely book again with dfds
the boath was on time the board personal was friendly and thank you
checking in takes a long time boarding takes a long time due to up and down decks that are very outdated compared to other ferries small cabins food quite good went back to hull because we suddenly had to pay the top price for the return trip compared to fjord line and color line where you get much more luxury for the same money it is actually a very old ferry that should have been replaced long ago its okay to have less luxury but the price has to reflect that there isnt much luxury on the travemunde ferry to malmo but the cabins there are spacious and we travel for half the price if ijmuiden to new castle
we took the dfds ferry from newcastle to amsterdam and back as foot passengers aps here we went as foot passengers from newcastle to ijmuiden and back first the ok stuff the cabin a twin with a window was ok the ship was clean and felt safe now the bad stuff most of what you buy on board will be priced at about more than youd pay in a high street that applies to meals coffee the buffet drinks dfds is clearly working on the principle that now youre trapped the duty free was about the same price as youd pay in tesco apart from a couple of headline brands which were a few pounds a litre cheaper while a high street restaurant has to pay rent rates insurance heat light and vat the dfds restaurants pay none of those but still charge more so a starter and main in the main restaurant with a single glass of cheap wine came in at a head it should be less than high street worse the onboard wifi costs about a day worse still the ship runs an exorbitantly expensive satellite phone cell so if like me you assume that there is no phone service and leave your phone on roaming it will download every piece of whatsapp and other stuff over this link without telling you i did not use my phone at all on board but left it on thinking it was signalless and was presented with a bill for on arrival at amsterdam this is basically a bait and switch trap at amsterdam you basically have no choice but to pay to take the dfds bus from the port to the city so dfds making about per trip which takes minutes another bait and switch on top of that the bus drivers were rude and unhelpful
we like the atmosphere on board dfds ferries the people we speak to are helpful pleasant and human the food is freshly cooked and of good quality and the coffee is not commercial and bitter the the boats are clean temperatures pleasant not too cold the seats comfortable and the toilets looked after
we got to the boat early and were helped very well which allowed us to catch a boat earlier
i made a mistake with the booking and the person on the checkin was wonderful sorted it out straight away and on the way back the person was so polite and helpful plus the boats were very clean and tidy
the worse both ways i had to wait hours to get the ferry because dfds decided to cancel ours this is absolutely insane it is not fair on your customers wasting hours while they have to drive for another or more hours dfds dont even apologise for the cancellation i will never use them again
everything went smooth and boarding was easy the ferry brought us to our destiation at the planned time
excellent information in advance excellent and smooth service at checkin there was nothing to report on the crossing itself next week we will choose dfds again
the organizational processes were professional the staff were always friendly and helpful the ship is a bit old and the cabins are very noisy the price for the crossings therefore seems too high to me
dfds once again ensures a carefree and pleasant crossing we enjoyed a commodore cabin fully equipped the food was delicious the employees were extremely friendly and once on board you can enjoy your welldeserved holiday i recommend it to everyone
nice smooth crossing on time sailings
we completely agree with the most recent review we also have been traveling with dfds for years always the dunkirkdover route the staff onboard are not only pleasant but very helpful as are both the french and uk staff in the port of dunkirk itself we have always been happy with the service right through from arriving to leaving alas we also have the same concern allowing buses full of students makes it much more of an unpleasant experience as there seems to be no control over them from their teachers or guardians and even after the public service announcement asking for them to stop running up and down the ship nothing changed and the noise throughout the crossing was horrendous and yes the food could be better as it used to be we would look forward to eating on the boat but we probably wont anymore as the price vs the quality no longer matches
that i was not able to use my bank pass i had a little moneyfor a meal but could not by duty free or a drink when the ferry broke down the fact its not possible to pay for things was for me a pretty much a shock spoilt the trip a bit
great experience ferry on time no troubles at all for the return we were proposed a ferry to calais instead of dunkirk because it was delayed and we accepted great solution and great service
super service and the food was top notch perfectly prepared we had a wonderful trip on the crown definitely the best ferry according to our taste many thanks for a wonderful and pleasant trip
whilst i appreciate being bumped to the earlier crossing because it was running late i then didnt get priority boarding and the premium lounge was very busy
we have been traveling with dfds for yrs using multitrips and we have always been happy with the service my only complaint is now you have started allowing buses full of students and i can tell you it is not a pleasant trip when there is bus load of kids one other thing the food could be better
reasonable price left arrived on time loadingunloading efficient boat clean and tidy aircon a tad cool formy liking though
the journey to oslo from copenhagen was great even though the ferry ride is long we had a great time on board there is plenty to do for children to keep them entertained and happy
wery good ferry
we were travelling with our motorbikes from amsterdam to newcastle handling of the bikes was well organised the cabin was nice and clean dinner and breakfast were good and hit the spot after the ride to the ferry and the crossing of the north sea nothing to complain
staff are already very helpful and friendly would definitely recommend dfds for channel crossings loading on and off the ferry will very likely fuss
it was our first trip to london by ferry we left from dunkirk and we could take one ferry earlier it saved us hours checking in was easy and there were plenty of seats in the restaurant when departing from dover you might also look at the names above the checkin gates otherwise you could choose the lane of the competition we almost did because we just looked at the size of the queues i recommend dfds for their flexibility competitive price and the easy way of traveling compared to flying
booked a trip in may with some friends and i had a few questions i emailed them but they couldnt even be bothered to answer my questions and just said ask on the day well my question was do i keep the same cabin in which case i can take a small suitcase
the bookingtool made mistakes first the wrong time on the way back the wrong dan it was corrected both time very easy through friendly staff still it would be better if they fixed the website journey itself was what you would expect nothing special but ok
the doverdunkirk return crossing was excellent check in staff and onboard service very good with great choice of food options and places to eat and relax huge duty free choice and great value at dunkirk but rather busy and you need to allow plenty of time to use this facility and the small cafe and toilet before called to board the ferry
when checking in to calais for the ferry to dover we arrived at which is later than the recommendedrequired time the person checking passports etcgave a paper for hanging in the car for the am ferry no communication was given and as my wife handed me the paper i was already driving off from the window it meant waiting hours in the car with an outside temperature of degc a long delay to our trip and more risk of driving when tired the ferry was not yet boarded so i am uncertain as to why we were not put on that ferry i doubt it was full but also dont know at least more explanation would have been appreciated when checking in
always had good service but now it was a contingency plan we were put down on cardek in a very narrow corridor where the passenger had to get off in advance otherwise you couldnt even get out to get back in the passenger had to climb in or brave the exhaust fumes on deck to make matters worse we were given the wrong map by the assistant on deck upon arrival so we made the wrong choice of packing three times rooms number are terribly noisy and you have to sleep to the rhythm of the diesel engines oh yes and if you are the first to arrive at the boat you are the last to leave never again
the ferry was super punctual great trip with friendly staff and everything you need is available on site really great value for money
when travelling with dfds l always book the club lounge for comfort for excellent service always offered by the club team a nice comfortable way to travel on dfds to europe and return trips
i booked directly on dfds site trip from copenhagen to oslo for july i payed x bed inside cabin bunk beds for one night the other day i saw on bookingcom the same trip the same cabin two nights for i felt like an idiot spent much more money just for booking directly on site so i was trying to refund the difference money called customer service sent emails to sales but dfds is so strict and merciless no refund what so ever i pay for my mistake very bad customer policy it is really not fair dfds just refers to their contract policy and ok i made mistake for not seeing better offer before paying that expensive offer but still it feels so wrong and i am not looking forward that trip in jully
the communication is very complete it was nice that we could have a drink on the boat while it was still in the harbour the north sea bistro is very good with very friendly staff there is plenty of entertainment on the boat communication on board is also excellent
everything well arranged only checkin took a bit too long there were only two counters open i think it could be done differently please let those bus operators with passports check in somewhere else ship king seaways is now really starting to receive maintenance many optical defects both outside and inside
the trip went fine although we had some delay
we were at the port around hours before our booked ferry time and were able to take an earlier ferry without any problems the for priority bidding was also worth it the staff on board were very friendly
our journey from dover to dunkerque and back again was plain sailing all the way staff on both sides were very efficient and friendly had cooked breakfast both times and enjoyed visiting the well stocked duty free shop staff were helpful and friendly and the ship was clean we had to change our travel plans and return on a different day the amendment was handled in a straightforward and simple manner
this was our first tour with a ferry and i am glad that i chose you we felt really comfortable
hello dfds oslo ferries my family friends and i are regular customers and have traveled probably times mainly on mini cruises to oslo but also with a few days hotel stay in oslo bought through dfds for example for the aha concert in oslo the reason why we travel so often is mainly sevenseas takeityourself table and yes we shop big for creams and other goods in the store so we all always end up with a gift card or often each since we almost all buy for dkk to dkk each time the staff are incredibly pleasant at both crown and pearl and there are often good singers or groups after dinner the cafe has got super good tea from perch for all of us tea drinkers and the prices are reasonable oslo is also a beautiful city and right now with quite good prices due to the currency we have just been on a mini cruise and hope that dfds reads this and does something about it is there extra in the shopping store on mondays and tuesdays because half of us got an extra on combined boxes and items that the other half of us didnt then you cannot once and for all give good information about this gift card some of us had gift cards but had to pay extra for the cabin while others used the easter offer and got all the money back in the duty free even though they stayed in the same type of cabin so it means that gift cards are now worth nok due to the many offers when many people travel together and we all agree that we buy on the same day and the last person who buys on the same day provides everyones booking numbers then it is somewhat worse stress and outings for the elderly sick in our family who also like want to come along we were spread over different floors despite your employee writing that it was important that we lived together so you must be able to do better at checkin they stated that they only looked at requests the same morning thats just not right we think also funny that we all order on the same day and the person who ordered first got floor while the last ones got floor the mattresses in the regular cabins are in dire need of replacement they are far too flat and thin and you get extremely sore in the back otherwise we think the cabins are ok and really nice with tv and music you cant ask for more when the prices are this low but now replace those mattresses please
we were allowed to leave a boat earlier no hassle no additional costs the children were given something to play with in the queue and there were play facilities on board good duty free shop seating on the deck the downside was the toilets these were very dirty and outdated to illustrate the urinals cleaners were adjusted incorrectly causing it to spray onto your pants there was one toilet full of poop overflowing and the others were covered in hair the renovation over time and cleaning clearly leaves much to be desired the competition has done this better
it was a great experience travelling with dfds
i mistakenly thought that the st of may with the th of april and was forced to pay an extra amount of at the terminal the desk clark was very rude and abrupt with me over a simple mistake on my part very disappointed after many good years
easy clear booking easy boarding and checkin plenty of time on board before departure top service you get what you order and expect plus top serviceminded crewstaff
i have traveled with dfds quite a few times but this is the last time i will ever travel with them the oslo boat has been transformed into a party cruise even on weekdays i had booked a commodore cabin with a private balcony and until in the morning on day and also extremely much partying and noise on evening no there was constant shouting and screaming from deck and from the neighboring balconies by some drunk norwegians who did not know respect for others than themselves who shouted and screamed from their balcony of course you have to be able to have fun on board but it has become a huge party cruise where you are not welcome if you are not into wild parties so if you would like to be able to sleep the nights you are on board then you should not travel with dfds never ever ever more dfds
we have travelled from newhaven to dieppe via dfds ferries for the best part of twenty years recently it has become harder to get them to take a booking via phone the voicemessages instruct you to leave a message why we want to give you money to book our channel crossing today as yesterday end of april it was hard to find a phone number that had a person at the end of it finally we emailed and they emailed a phone number back to us today st may one star for rebecca being proactive in an office somewhere this resulted in our talking to a man in newcastle finally booking made and our discount for being added in isnt it time dfds brought their site up to date and catered for all types of travellers in a userfriendly way or is their idea to make nonlorry traffic go away
the trip is far too long and the time in copenhagen is far too short as well as the fact that the prices for a norwegian have become far too high it will be colorline next time i go to denmark where the prices are more adapted to norwegian kroner
booked a crossing for hours from dover to dunkirk horribly slowed down at a quarter to cars still have to leave the boat that was already there before oclock no traffic on or off the boat for several minutes bad directions it is now well after pm and still not loaded what a mess yuck last time we left dover on time and also with a half hour delay in dunkirk so well see now
it wasnt great or poor just what we would expect this is a short practical crossing just looking for efficiency which we gotbut there is no luxury involved
the ship urgently needs a general renovation
easy to book boat very friendly crew no stress boats normally on time
intransparent pricing policy why do you have to pay for a dog and are not allowed to bring it on the ship
hi i am a frequent traveler of dfds and always book with you i traveled last month but had the worst experience travelling from calais to dover on march i arrived at the checkin counter and was on time for the ferry scheduled and was travelling with my dad which means two passengers the french lady at the counter was on the phone and not concentrating on how many passengers were in the car she gave me a ticket for one person when going through security they stopped me and said the ticket is not valid since it shows only one passenger and there are two people in the car the security said i need a new one and someone will come to take me to the exit which is delayed by minutes for someone to come i missed my ferry and the next ferry they gave me was the following day which means hours wait for the next ferry the person at the counter was very rude when i went back she couldnt speak english when you are working for a big company like dfds i expect for the customer service agent to speak at least proper english so i had a bad experience with dfds would use po in the future of other ferry operators since dfds doesnt want to resolve this issue and replies with an automated email response
was really good just unfortunate was the last boogie on the boat
great crew super clean ship have used dfds many times and would be my first choice
the service on board and the smooth process from checkin to arrival at the respective destination port is simply great the staff are very friendly no matter what area they are in the staff at checkin and boarding deserve special mention here this was my th crossing to and from england with dfds and im always happy to do it again
the service was very good everything can be booked easily and clearly
we have travelled with dfds dover to dunkirk and dover calais several times since and everything is slways great except for breakfast but u get a free drink everything for this price is cold obvs the lights dont work properly and this morning i actually asked for an egg that was cooked that went down like a lead balloon and the one i got wasnt much better wow standby salmonella if i wasnt so hungry on the early ferry i really wouldnt bother a lot of staff to help but can u pls get a chef that can cook a basic full english
friendly staff punctual crossing and clean ship
i was having trouble booking a group of motorbikes i spoke with connor and leanne who were both very helpful and made my booking easy i always travel with dfds and recommend them
everything was excellent from start to finish i caught the dfds bus from newcastle city centre a few minutes walk from the train station which was convenient it takes about minutes to the port checkin at the port was quick and easy and wellorganised my cabin was very good clean and comfortable and the food in the explorers kitchen restaurant was excellent all freshly prepared and loads of choice including vegan they prepared a variety of dishes from other countries for dinner not just the uk and netherlands staff were all excellent too pleasant and helpful i felt the whole journey was very relaxing
nice modern clean ship helpful staff and amazing prices in the dfds duty free shop at the port
good service in the premium lounge and boarding was easy because the personel was very friendly and helpfull because of the illnes of my grandchild i had to rebook my return for day earlier it felt very bad that i had to pay an extra amount of just for the officework thats a pitty and therefore not but stars but thnks anyway willem van den heuvel the netherlands
boat was clean and pleasant return evening food however was cold especially the chips loading and offloading was very easy and efficient and your staff were very helpful to meet my disability needs would definitely travel with dfds again
very nice ferry under control everything stuff good only im not happy when i change the time and date i get charged before was it free of charge
i will always sail with dfds everything is reliable and smooth very helpful staff
hello i have come with this message to inform you and express my dissatisfaction about my last trip with your company dfds the reservation number was on the planned return from dover to calais we showed up for checkin at am the attendant then told us that the boat to calais was more than an hour late and offered us a pm departure from dunkirk which we accepted because we had a lot of km to do in france when leaving dover i noticed that two dfds boats were leaving i went to the ships information service and they confirmed to me that it was indeed the ship for calais and that it was on time i dont understand why we were disembarked from the ship this was already planned because we were on the site more than hours before departure no sms no message lie given to the customer this impacted our return travel time cost and fatigue is it okay to treat customers this way it seems obvious that this company is overbooking and grossly deceiving their customers
it is always nice to come to a clean and tidy ferry with a high level of service small problems such as air conditioning not working are solved with lightning speed good food and good service just think that for two glasses of water in connection with a bottle of red wine is probably just on the high side
restaurant remained closed because there were not enough guests another restaurant was open instead it was stated on a letter at the counter we wont go there broadcasting would have been a small effort but that didnt happen in newcastle the boat left at half past four while our booking stated oclock sloppy if you cant rely on times and it would also have been useful if the email had stated somewhere that you had to follow ferry tineside signs after all we were on our way to newcastle seaport
the ferry crossing was good and the staff were very friendly and helpful it was a shame that the cafe in the port was shut
firstly i ordered a cabin with a sea view and two beds but a week before departure they had moved me to a cabin with a limited view and bunk bedsi had a cabin facing the deck where the guests sat right outside in front of my window and smoke secondly my cabin was dirty everywhere there was no soap in the soap dispenser the tv didnt work etc etc i was told at the reception that i could upgrade my room but only one way it would cost me an extra what i got enough breakfast out and home on the trip as a dispensationbut would have rather had a cabin where the guests couldnt stand and look directly in and a clean cabin it would suit dfdf to refund the money for my journey or offer me a new journey in a better cabin
the staff both on the quay and on the boat is very helpful and friendly
everthing allright friendly staff clean cabins great guitarist and good band in the columbus club sailed on the mini cruise times from january and am now a member of the friends dfds
ijmuiden newcastle great time on board bringing my daughter over to england for a project the service of the staff in general from the friendly welcoming and guiding to the cabin nrs till the staff of the explorers buffet was all excellent as well goes for all other services fooddrinks etc however must admit that our cocktail sex on the beach tasted more rather like a mixed juicemocktail on the other hand i did notice on the return voyage that mv king seaways originally the sister ship of the princess seaways looked much fresher and updoneupgraded more this is the reason i give a
we made a return trip from dover to dunkirk on both crossings we arrived in time to be put on an earlier crossing which was processed quickly and without fuss very helpful the ferry was clean and comfortable and made for a relaxing crossing much appreciated after a long drive i used the duty free shop at the dunkirk terminal and got a great deal on my favourite scotch ive got another trip booked for summer
we had a delay i know this can happen but it took a lot of time from our visit in newcastle also because we had to wait in the transfer busses till it wass full the row to border controle wass nor organised wirh people for the minicruise or just one wat people that also gace delay
the booking and subsequent alteration was simple and pain free the price was competitive check in staff were friendly and helpful offering us earlier sailings both at dover and calais the ferries were clean well organised and had plenty of facilities the cream tea with prosecco was excellent value
we got a good upgrade for little money the service was good on this trip suggestion why not have a loyalty scheme we have been using dfds for close on years and have never gotten something extra or an upgrade or anything to motivate us to use it again
delays on both journeys although on the return journey i actually got onto the previous scheduled sailing which was running an hour behind a fault with the loading ramp smooth journeys despite a swell the crews must have recently received customer service training refreshers because they were actually greeting and bidding farewell to passengers almost an airlinestyle level of service well done
i understand that you cannot control the wheather i went on the minicruise last friday and it went out to be such a stormy wheater during the trip windfource my friend and i where so terribly seesick which we both did not forsee i would have been nice that we where handed seesich motionsickness pills in any form or shape by the ship crew we had a terrible night and almost hours delay also so we where so sad because of that
could get an earlier boat without surcharge very nice boat and good service
great experience on the ship room was amazing on pearl seaways however i bought the tickets through a partner where one could earn some points after weeks of trying dfds are denying that the tickets were bought from the partner which leaves no points unfortunate with the small problem to an elsewise great experience
great trip from duinkerke to dover check in was fast personel was very friendly and helpful
a great fuss free trip both ways staff were helpful polite and efficient with the distance from east yorkshire to dover amounting to a hour trip without hold ups as well as unpredictable queuing times it is difficult to predict the arrival time so we were very pleased to have been placed on the earliest ferry for both crossings
me and a mate went on a plumbo cruise with dfds the first thing that meets you is an old and rundown boat and this is the newest one they have cabin and toilet are dirty and disgusting and everything costs extra and when everything has to cost money it is incredibly hard that the prices have to be incredibly high there are no opportunities to purchase cold drinks on board apart from shopping at the bar even not at the dutyfree they sell ice cubes so that we can have cold drinks on board at the same time the duty free was emptied relatively quickly when they let some young people buy a pallet of certain goods the shuttle bus in copenhagen is not worth the money and the highlight at the quay is the grocery store a few blocks away during the concert wellgrown people pushed and took far too great liberties while the security guards had no control this completely ruined the concert experience and this was what we had been looking forward to the most the flow of information among the employees on the boat is also completely miserable because those at the reception have no control things are moved without being notified and the bingo on the first evening was canceled without any warning
sensational would love to travel with you again nice staff everything was possible without any problems thank you very much and we look forward to seeing you again soon
at checking in we could switch to a double bed instead of bunk beds the beds on the king seaways seem harder than on the princess which we had on the way to the uk on the princess were nice and soft although it was a busy crossing we heard nothing at night and slept well one thing that could be improved is how busy the bus was to the ferry on the early bus there were lots of people with suitcases and it was crowded and some had to stand maybe it is handy if you could book a bus in advance so dfds know how many people are waiting and maybe send a second bus
great ferry nice personal clean rooms perfect duty free nice coffee on ferry
had a good trip forth and back ijmuidennewcastle in a force wind the ship was well stabilized dinner buffet and breakfast were varied and good quality i was new to boarding a ferry with a car and missed a concise map of how to get at the terminal checkin
so when i went to dunkirk ferry terminala bit of a problem when i was there the staff chanced the checkin time from pm to am while it was pm and told to leave and we had to go to an another port because of time
bad experience we had chosen a cabin with a sea view but without notifying us they changed the room to a cabin with a view of the deck although we were very unhappy and honest about this they could not give us the cabin we had ordered it turned into a couple of vouchers to use on board which we couldnt use for anything at all a pity when we had been looking forward to a sea view correction dfds has now got us the right cabin so everything is good again
having booked a journey with dfds i was then given the uniquely useful opportunity to sample travelling on a fine p o cross channel ferry without the need for me to feel guilt at feathering the nest of those ruthless exploiters of slave labour p o the reason for this ferry company cross cooperation was not explained to me and the p o ferry arrived about half an hour late in dover so it was not a good advert for their service
really bad customer service me and my girlfriend are lucky enough to have x gift cards of nok each for an optional dfds journey i call to book a citycruse but am told that i cannot use my gift cards to pay for any of the trip then ask the nice employee if i can talk to her colleague it has informed her about this but i cant i am puzzled by the message as it says on the gift card that it is an optional trip nowhere is there any kind of restriction
have booked a trip at the beginning of november with a sea view and here a week before departure i suddenly see by chance that they have suddenly rebooked my room to bunk beds with a limited view of the deck without them writing and informing us of this change when i contact customer service its a very welcoming and understanding guy i talk to who can see the problem the same when i get a call the next day its great to feel understood and welcomed an error in the system was to blame because it was overbooked i have ordered it turned out that some reported so that we could get what we had ordered
turned up at calais after an eight hour drive only to be told that the port was closed because of strike action by port workers no idea how long we would have to wait for a a boat or even if there was one however our booking was transferred to dunkirk and after a short journey there we were able to take a boat to dover crossing took a bit longer but we were able to eat a freshly cooked meal in comfortable surroundings well done dfds
easy boarding ship had all my needspleasant cruise friendly staff
i was planning a trip which included a ferry crossing from the uk to europe and decided on dfds uk due to the access to newcastle i opted to book online and was able to select most of my travel options until it came to travelling with pets i contacted the chat bot and the operator andrea replied with some of the information i needed i was left having to leave the chat bot to find other information before calling by telephone to finalise the booking bizarrely andrea answered the call she did however make the booking for me i later discovered two shocking errors in the booking whereby dfds took two payments for the same booking and another whereby andrea from dfds had not booked the full meal inclusive package agreed both are inconvenient errors and a disappointment during our holiday but more importantly dfds have not refunded the amount over charged three weeks later due to a holiday week and its a system
dfds is flexible to multitrip passengers
as always had excellent crossing with dfds staff always helpful and ships always clean would recommend to anyone
our car was first on the boat on our return and yet we were the very last off when at newcastle port not really good enough due to the space your people directed us to
i purchased frequent traveller tickets for plus on march and was alarmed to see both amounts had been taken twice from my bank account i phoned you immediately and you admitted you had a glitch in your system however despite two further calls i have still not had a refund this is an appalling and totally unacceptable treatment of a longstanding and loyal customer i await an immediate refund and a substantial explanation and apology peter bullock
quick and easy boarding on my motorbike but the only negative is strapping the bike down myself and no pads to protect the bike from the straps other ferry companies will do all that for you cabin excellent food very good entertainment good prices on board very fair staff really good and attentive
i always cross the channel to dunkirk with dfds as i have always had a pleasant experience my recent outbound crossing was delayed for two hours however with no reason given i also received a text message for my return journey saying allow mins for customs checks but this was not necessary at the time another two hour wait to leave dunkirk
getting on board was very well supervised you will immediately receive your cabin number and how to get there everything is very well and clearly indicated so everything is easy to find the staff on board are great helpful thoughtful and very friendly the only disadvantage is with the bunk beds i personally find the steps you have to climb to the top very dangerous especially if you are not too flexible doesnt really click into place firmly and is very steep the overall experience was definitely worth it
on the outward journey the pm ferry turned out to be delayed and i was allowed to sail on that instead of having to wait for the pm ferry top and on the return journey there was still room on the ferry to calais which would sail in minutes and i was asked if i wanted that instead of waiting another hours for the ferry to dunkirk once again top
great experience clean rooms on the ship good entertainment options on board what can improve payment process online and waiting time to discharge when we wanted to pay for our booking we got errors a couple of times and we had to wait a long time to get off the vessel and notifications were given only for passengers with cars
delayed departure from fredrikshavn the boat arrived at the quay from copenhagen at about and we received zero information while we stood in the queue for over two hours waiting to get on board nor was any information posted on the dfds website the link was shown didnt work the room was also very noisy with vibration sounds in the walls and ceiling at certain motor frequencies i taped some of the loose plastic junk and stuck other parts by pushing cardboard into cracks and that helped a little
love travelling with dfds a great company taking care of both passengers and staff members would not go for any ferry company having now dropped eurotunnel two years ago
you took the payment for this trip twice on inthe sum of x inspite of telephone calls to your office with the promise of refund i still have not received payement
the only reason for and not is that the cafeteria staff did not want to provide a child i might add tap water on the way to france th april the bar staff did without any issue the crossing was otherwise very pleasant thank you
we have been rating for a long time and never before has it been so difficult for us to rate based solely on the stars everything the organization at checkin and departure the friendliness of the staff the evening meal and the breakfast everything was really and without reservation top notch but we were in a bed sea view cabin on deck and thats where the dilemma began the crossing was quite turbulent waves up to meters its not the ships fault but we felt like we were in the engine room it was an unbelievable continuous and absolutely disgusting noise nuisance communication in the cabin during the journey was only possible by shouting it was by far the worst night i can remember stabilization systems on the ship are clear and important but the cabin cannot be offered like this the noises were there even before the waves but then became unbearable during the quotturbulencequot the shower was also miserable it is located above the toilet and when you take a shower the entire bathroom is flooded
i usually use the tunnel but with prices so prohibitive this easter i used the ferry for the first time in years hassle free check in at both ports and we got bumped onto the earlier ferry at calais which was great nicely equipped ships with great duty free shops and good food return journey was spoilt by smelly toilets and lorry drivers who see fit to treat the restaurant bench seats as a bed one without flip flops on and no staff dealing with their inconsiderate actions other than that happy with the service
fast and smooth crossing we could even effortlessly take a boat earlier
out family like that way of travelling wish there would be a connection from germany or danmark to england
the trip was as usual but the prices were not exactly favorable
to all on sunday the th of april we contacted dfds live chat service to amend booking dunkirk dover we requested jay to amend the booking and specifically inquired for options either from dunkirk or calais between and on the th of april it was confirmed to us by jay that a crossing from dunkirk to dover at on the of april was available we agreed to proceed with the change and this was confirmed to us by jay see attached screenshot when arriving on the april around pm at dunkirk we were requested to pay an additional to onboard the ferry from dunkirk to dover as you can imagine we were very surprised about this since the previous day a dfds employee confirmed to us in writing a ferry was available and booked to depart at from dunkirk we had to wait for hours with our months old son inside the car for this same period our return home was delayed for over hours due the the incompetence of dfds employee no response given after sending a complaint email appalling this service
we were able to board ferries in both directions in advance of the timings we had booked for that is much appreciated your staff at the checkin on both ends were terrific we appreciate the flexibility of arriving early and being able to board the next sailing we also appreciate the free wifi the kindness and efficiency of dfds staff is wonderful
i love the seven sisters and the cote dalbatre theyre comfortable and the crew are always helpful i do the sailing between newhaven and dieppe at least six times a year and look forward to it every time its a ferry crossing which is hundreds of years old and dfds are keeping history and tradition going brilliantly for excellent customer service and a great cross channel ferry sailing experience they are second to none in my experience i also want to add that i sometimes go by car with my dog sometimes as a foot passenger alone and sometimes as a foot passenger with my dog as a paw passenger and all three ways are equally well catered for the only thing i will say is that for years i have been trying to work out in what order cars are invited to board and the methodology still eludes me its like trying to work out the rules of mornington crescent
this was our th time travelling with dfds between calais and dover and everything went smoothly from start to finish
a team effort backed up with a clear leadership directive from check in to loading to on board servcice the dfds team all puled together to ensure a customer focussed approach the ferry was not busy but it had all the facilities needed and well designed overall one of my best cross channel experiences
great staff friendly and helpful wherever we encountered them both trips were comfortable and enjoyable the only disappointment was that information about the closure of colbert bridge in dieppe for the duration of our trip was a bit vague and it would have been fantastic to have had a shuttle or something to spare us the hour it took to walk into town via the alternative route when we arrived
we were allowed to board an earlier ferry at no extra cost as we had reached the port before the allotted time once on the ferry a delicious breakfast to set us up for the day
was lovely to be able to drive onto the earlier sailing each time when we presented at the port a bit early
booking and communication prior journey was brilliant staff on the boat were polite friendly and helpful on the return journey we were woken up in plenty of time to get ready
all on time boarded without delay fine crossing breakfast was average
i cannot fault the customer service staff who have been so helpful prior to travelling above and beyond polite patient service and efficiency on this particular trip both outgoing and return journeys were delayed by an hour with very little information given as to when we would eventually load or depart or eta once on board i was warned to arrive minutes before departure but was through passports and checkin in less than minutes combined with a delayed departure thats a long time to site around at the crack of dawn with just toilet facilities open in dover i dont usually experience delays so this was a new experience for me having received a text advising of a one hour delay several hours before checkin at dunkerque i was surprised when i asked at checkin for further information that the lady wasnt aware of any delays there were no announcements on the tannoy and having my view blocked by vehicles in the lane meant i wasnt aware until much later that there was something on the screen only this referred to a crossing not the it wasnt up to date on board was very clean and staff very welcoming nice friendly service in the cafe and although this time i didnt eat in the restaurant i usually thoroughly enjoy whats on offer especially the chicken or the curry portions are always generous and tasty as far as im concerned they are the only worthwhile cross channel ferry provider
was late leaving dunkirk were supposed to be in dover at am did not leave the ferry till pm no information was give as for the delay will not be using you again what a farce
it was very rough crossing and the cabin was excellent
the actual trip was fine too many children but that was not a problem the complaint this time was the fact that we arrived at the check in minutes before the sailing and were advised by the operative that the desk had closed and we would be on the sailing hrs later but we might be allowed if the loading had not finished we were a long time in passport control queue not your fault but still arrived at a half full ship minutes before sailing so not sure what the problem was
dfds took our group of people from ijmuiden to newcastle and back at a fair price we received a friendly welcome at registration and passport control which continued during the instructions for the vehicle and especially when we arrived on the ship the cabins were functional and of a reasonable size the onboard program was very entertaining although we only used the music part the crossing was stormy dfds cannot influence that
the trip went well we arrived on time from kiel to klaipeda breakfast was very good we only ate that the cabin was great checkin in klaipeda was quick and easy checkin in kiel was not ideal we were taken from the terminal to the ship in a bus that had room for people and it took us almost two hours we would have liked a lot more information on the ship where we are roughly when we will see the mainland what the situation is with the storm which we had etc such information could have been displayed on all of the many screens instead of the penetrating loud music
on recent crossings since brexit my bug bare has been the long embarkation and disembarkation times but my last trip was swift and efficient for a am departure from dieppe i was actually onboard in my cabin and climbing into bed at amazing the off season revamp of cabins has given them a nice uplift and the replacement of the old swipe operated door locks that were never any good at actually unlocking the doors have been replaced with a presentation and scan lock that so far has been successful i dont know if soundproofing in the cabins has been upgraded or its my new earplugs but i didnt hear any annoying car alarms going off even though it was one of the roughest sea crossings ive been on or maybe all the drivers remembered to switch off their vehicle motion sensor alarms
easy check in with a bike small delay in departing dover smooth crossing
boat left and arrived on time from booking to loading to onboard facilites the staff were efficient polite and helpful
why have childrens play area right next to the quiet reclining chairs room youve spent all that money refurbishing the devils dyke room for its atmosphere to be destroyed by screaming children having fun its important the children are happy and enjoying themselves but in a space that doesnt impact others and vica versa with adults i was not the only passenger in despair at the noise levels even with headphones in secondly speed up your unloading ive just returned back to ferries after the tunnel is pricing itself out of reach for regular passengers i travelled to dover with you and was off and away quickly why does newhaven take so long to unload and get us on our way can you not do more pre checking like at the tunnel on positive feedback staff were helpful
the crossings were on time no fuss with loadingunloading the cars and customer service were first class in dealing with my enquiries
always a pleasant trip when travelling back and forth to the uk via dunkirk dover no hassle last time we took the premium option a pleasant experience for the hr crossing
could not fault the ferry experience in any way as a seafarer myself the ship was a credit to the captain and crew really helpful friendly staff the only issue with the entire trip was the newcastle side of things we got the bus from the city centre to the terminal and it was like the last chopper out of saigon getting everyone crammed onto one bus with luggage no sense of organisation at all the dutch side was the complete opposite with everything organised and well run although it was chaotic we would definitely use the ferry again but just leave the car in the long stay car park
i just now experienced that my credit card did not complete the payment when i had to order a ferry ticket from fredrikshavn to oslo with dfds i immediately tried to pay once more and then the price had increased by nok the ticket initially cost nok incl car and accommodation that is an increase of just over in a split second it simply cannot be right that your cockie system should ensure extreme overpricing of your tickets it should be illegal if it is not already and no i dont believe that there are so many others who look at the same date half a year in the future off season by the way this is not the first time but now it is simply enough i expect an answer and the same price for the ticket i originally intended to buy
i was amazed at the terrible quality of the food breakfast on the way out only white sliced bread available realy no brown bread no decent bread very poor coffee should be ashamed of yourselves on our return we ate before boarding the decor remeinded me of the lat time i took a ferry to france over years ago no change at all the boarding was swift and good but the disemarking in the uk was a farce over minutes sitting before we began to move was it the first time this crew had been employed maybe next time we will go from dover
staff service ferry everything is always top notch i travel at least times per year with dfds and wouldnt have it any other way
please tell the earliest start for checkin in your confirmation email instead of only the latest checkintime its confusing as hell and ruined my last day of my vacation as i spent hours waiting in a less than comfortable terminal without any valuable information chat is too slow too or you could just make an onlinecheckin with the exact boarding time like other companies thank you for nothing should have taken the plane its easier than your complicated process even if the ferry and onboardservice will be good i wont travel with you again
managed to get an earlier ferry smooth crossing and great service
quick checkin and even the opportunity to get on the ferry before the booked one
andrea who helped me to book up was really greatshe took the time to make sure we had the best offer due to us not being able to use our woucher coupon so that was the start of our trip the cruise it self was very welcoming and the boat was really clean the food was excerlent we had an eveining meal and also a breakfast we would deffinately recommend dfds xx
wednesday april rd we took the boat from noon the entire crossing took more than hours we were floating like ducks in front of the harbor of dover for more than two hours my entire planning was going to fall apart then you think too bad but on the way back saturday april again more than an hour and a half delay i made good use of that time hoek from holland to england is exactly the diesel additional charge i have left to get to duikerken or drive drive to dunkirk or i spend hours on a boat of course there will be an official complaint about this reserveringsnummer check it your selff
i would like more communication about the delays say on a road for hours is not really acceptable for your customers or the people that live in dover i also think you should communicate more that dogs will not be allowed out of the car and there is literally no where apart from the road leading up to the ferry on where to walk them not really dog friendly although i did like when you checked in they checked the paperwork then and there saving time
a ships wheelchair was requested for my husband but this for the first time since weve been travelling with dfds this was not available on the deck where we were told to park i was disappointed that i had to go in search of this essential item
very comfortable seating clean ferry helpful staff
everything was fine and well organized the check out situation for passengers without vehicles was very confusing though we were told that we would have to wait for special instructions but those never came we also had difficulties to find the excit of the harbour and the information center wasnt helpful in finding a taxi or giving us information for taking the bus
overall the travel experience was good boarding is straightforward the cabins were comfortable and clean the onboard meals had a good choice the staff were very friendly and helpful the only downside was the security check at amsterdam took a long time we were on the last coach connection which didnt leave until am this made us late for a trip we had booked i felt for people on the mini cruise as their time was shortened by quite a bit it was a bit frustrating and not previously happened when we have traveled this way
very well presented boat
transfer to station in dieppe for footpassengers the ferry journey was excellent but spoilt by difficulty getting to station from boat either a long walk or long wait for a taxi and almost missing train after over an hour
i had horrible experience with that ferry never say never but i wont use this ferry anymore i booked of people with a car food and internet included paid in march euro for of us one way from rosslane to dunkirk unfurnished the experience was horrible no internet at all food disaster raw chips not many to choice they donnot have a normal coffee ferry very old i survived hrs on this ferry but was crazy unfortunately i find out hours before dunkirk that this wasnt original ferry my ferry which i booked was on nct have no clue how this call for a ships but was on nct and they gave us albania ferry and because of that standard was totally different then dfds ferry ok i understand everything but dfds ferry u should charge same price if u giving us albania ferry which is very bad condition horrible food and no internet for hrs i was begging internet on the end of trip from staff casue i need to my gps they do not care said here is no internet thats all thanks god my phone start working and my roaming so i got a signal and gps start working otherwise i will be lost in dunkirk shame on u dfds i can compare now this ferry what u give it to me to irish ferry irish ferry was precent better then u internet included and tickets with a car and insurance cost me only euro from chersburg to dublin and u charged me euro and no food no internet very cold on a ferry bad experience
travelling with dfds is always a pleasure
newer updated ferry a more pleasant crossing experience mobile ports to free charge mobile more comfy seating and a much bigger shop only issue the food is not always so good
we were pleased to see the new refurbished ship and thought that it all worked really well the new layout seems to be very practical
commodore de luxe excellent way to travel ijmuiden amsterdam to newcastle overnight decided to buy the topoftherange commodore de luxe cabin a very comfortable wellequipped spacious and above all relaxing way to get from mainland europe to the uk excellent double bed which allowed for a great nights sleep so much less stressful than the usual airport hassle would thoroughly recommend
the whole experience was seamlessfrom check in at calais through immigration boarding the crossing to disembarking
the ferry has been newly outfitted and the reclining chairs are much are much better the whole passenger area looks much more modern the staff are always welcoming i would say excellent value for money
delays reaching amsterdam by hours only had hours to explore
check in went fine and quickly but delays bought ways of over hour got informed on the way back there might be minutes delay minutes before we should departing
aura seaways is a beautiful modern ship that servers kielklaipda route highly recommend booking journey on this ferry the only downside we found was a lack of dogfriendly public spaces it is really hard having to spend over hours in a cabin with minimal access to outdoor space tiny pet outdoor deck there were so many people with wellbehaved dogs onboard could you please consider opening some cafe space for us to use in the future thank you very much
we booked a trip to oslo for people and we have a dog with us it says you must contact customer service so after the order has been completed and the more expensive petfriendly cabin has been chosen we will complete the order subsequently when you contact customer service we are informed that the dog costs an additional dkk per way there is no time period in the order stating that this fee will be imposed my wife then contacts dfds who simply say that they cant do anything about it but that we can get of the price refunded if we cancel i have now had to make calls send pictures of their own booking process to finally get the full amount refunded its not ok
dont like the fact that you cant buy alcohol and just take it with you rather than waiting until the arrival in port first time ive ever had to pay for coach transfers when on a mini cruise and ive been on quite a few had to leave columbus club when watching the band as my year old son couldnt stay with me just me and him travelling it was pm uk time so not much else to do after that i think soft drinks tea coffee should be included when you have already paid enough for the meal in the explorers restaurant all these things add up and will prob affect my decision to travel this way in future
the boat is great and quite new my family felt very comfortable and the duty free shop is reasonable my kids and i bought a lot of things
everyone was helpful lovely views from the boat plus priority boarding was great for the kids almost missed our ferry back but we made it with help from the staff
great day trip boats ran to time and very clean cant fault the service all staff provided great customer service
got a cabin on deck as soon as i entered inside the cabin the network on my phone was even though we were still in harbour it was very warm inside so i tried to lower the heat but it seemed broken since i could keep turning the termostat around outside my cabin it sounded like a kindergarten with kids running constantly knocking each door for fununder bed there were piles of dust and in toilet there were still signs that the last user had a bad stomach ive used dfds a lot before in time like once a month visiting my family in denmark and have never experienced anything like this thats why i still give them some stars i put a note on my laptop that if i will book trip again never book ticket travelling with crownpearl is so much better since the lowest deck u will be on is deck and still have cellphone reception like the first hour after departure from copenhagen and the last hours before arrival in oslo i know its a cheap way of going between dk and norway and i will surely give it a try again but on pearlcrown is not worth it
the trip which was meant to be hours long ended up taking hours as there was an unexplained stop
dfds ship and staff were great dover port aweful massive delays going out we were delayed for hours while the ship looked for a man overboard on our return journey and my wife had to attend to a medical emergency
our motorhome broke down as we tried to leave the ferry at calais a trip we have made several times all the staff were very helpful from the loading guys up to the cabin staff we had to return back to the uk on the same ferry after we managed to turn it around we were then taken to the premium lounge and looked after for our trip back i can only praise dfds for all their care after having to cancel our planned holiday and will hopefully be back to use them soon
very easy to book board problem free travel thank you dfds
delayed both ways poor passport control generally very slow procedure
even though i was over an hour early for my crossing i was refused on my booked ferry and had over minute delay it appeared they overbooked the ferry and just like me many other early arrivers were left in our vehicles no refreshments were offered and communication was very poor geertjans tone choice of language and over all attitude was appalling customer service after having used eurotunnel for many years and trying this ferry service i will go back to eurotunnel as the price difference isnt worth the long wait and appalling service
why i had to pay to get on board on to an earlier ship when i had a ticket already the boat i get on was hours earlier and not even half full
we always take a dfds ferry when traveling from germany to the uk its a wonderful part of the trip we love the atmosphere on board as always we bought some food and drinks on board the prices are fair we also felt very comfortable and safe on the last crossing we didnt give the last star because the toilets werent in good condition otherwise everything was fine as always
refurbished ferry is nicely done the menu good and service good too loading at newhaven could have been a bit quicker but i think that was the weather
flexibility dfds changed my ferry timing on arrival at both ports keeping my time spent hanging about at a minimum thank you much appreciated
my wife and i arrived promptly at dunkirk check in she had fallen whilst in germany and managed to break her knee cap in places the check in lady kindly arranged a position close to the lift which made life excellent for us all the staff and crew were exceedingly pleasant and helpful which made the voyage almost perfect thanks to dfdswe are regular users of your ferries and will remain so many thanks gerard blackett
we were offered an earlier boat at no extra cost the vip lounge was wonderful
booked priority embarkationdisembarkation loading is not an issue disembarkation is a farce pay for the privilege of being unloaded after non paying cars a complete rip off dont bother paying extra for it youre being ripped off also booked the premium lounge this was excellent both ways staff were friendly and professional expensive but very much worth it fourth trip with dfds one booked for october and then i wont book again hate being sold a product that is not worth it
we were a family of three adults traveling with dfds we got what we bought from services nothing to complain about it was fresh and good food good entertainment you felt safe on board pleasant polite and attentive staff the various games shuffle board helped enormously to improve the wellbeing of travelers there were many students on the journey back to oslo many of them at disco dfds has brilliant scales that stop unpleasant situations immediately whether they involve drunk people or violence among the guests i only give feedback it is important that the beds in the upper cabins have fall protection for safetys sake we missed this in room fantastic service we would be happy to travel with dfds again in the near future
it was a pity that our crossing was delayed for more than ours because of technical problems the free cup of coffee was a pour curtesy offer we still prefer dfds because they offer best service for money staff are friendly and competent
a nice ferry to travel on plenty of different areas to sit during the trip particularly like the quiet areas with the recliner seats staff friendly and helpful just a very relaxing trip
in terms of the process everything was clearly indicated and well supervised what we really didnt like on the ferry was the lack of opportunities to find something to eat on board as a vegan despite asking we were unable to get any further help the website explicitly states that there would be vegan food and we relied on that all we could do was buy a packet of chips the only vegan packet to help with the seasickness we were left with a very disappointing experience in
driving back from dover to the continent on good friday was very difficult we booked a ferry at pm and arrived at dover at oclock but had to wait more than hours to be in lane waiting for the ship knowing there would be a lot of traffic on good friday we dont unterstand the long queues at the dfds checkin
the ferry was great but sadly the experience was tarnished by the hour wait to clear french border control
had an inside person dog cabin normally person dog cabins you can fold up all bunks to make a seating area or make more space for the dog like the other boat on the same route on this boat the two lower bunks were fixed frames which only gave our dog the chance to lay down in the entrance area that is really alloying cause if you wanna enter the bathroom or exit the cabin you wake him up and have to step over himwhich neither of us fancied as dogs do not belong on beds or furniture we felt stuckcramped and not at ease so that was a pity otherwise travel was ok
if somebody books a ferry at a certain time he also wants to be on that ferry and not h later on another one due to incompetence of dfds never had this with other ferry companys everything goes to slow and is not automated also normally people must check in before going true border control and custom but here you first go true border control and customs and then you check in this will never work correctly for booking at a certain time because everybody can drive true border control and custom and then probably gets the ferry earlier then he booked there is no way to send them of the terminal if they are to early no good word about this trip with the ferry and free drink voucher as compensation isnt enough if you pay for a trip on certain time and can get on that ferry because of the incompetence of dfds
dfds as always a wonderful tripexperience delicious food good service nice cabin and yes it was a fantastic trip unfortunately my son fell ill on the way home the guard was helpful and we got off in frederikshavn one small thing i missed during this was we missed on arrival someone guiding us to the ambulance it was down at the front of the ship we just couldnt see how we got down there so we followed the other passengers through the gangway which is very long which was tough because my son had an asthmatic attack on top of that he was sick we were tired we used a lot of extra resources to find the way call the police so that they could contact the ambulance which was now very far away we could have wished someone had just shownguided us down to the ambulance we know you are busy and have to move on but it would have been a huge help if you had advised us right there another small thing could have been we were offered a supervision by perhaps one of your coxswains if it is still like that they can still provide some help we spoke to one but that was it otherwise i just want to praise you
i booked a crossing from rosslare to dunkirk with dfds on march nd i was at the port in rosslare on time at pm i was shown to the port area nobody said anything about the ferry being overbooked at around pm i had to watch as the ferry left without me after asking i was told that a second ferry was leaving at midnight an italian ship what i then experienced was absolutely horrific as we drove in a crew member shouted at me even though i hadnt done anything wrong the cabins were dirty the food absolutely inedible the wifi didnt work on saturday afternoon it got so hot in the cabins that it was unbearable the ferry was supposed to arrive in dunkirk at midnight and by the time i could get off the ship it was almost am in my opinion these are fraudsters who should be taken out of circulation immediately once with dfds never again with dfds
so much better a revamped boat
put me on an earlier boat without problems
i sailed as usual with ms pearl from oslo to copenhagen which is usually better than ms crown i travel as usual on the commodore class du lux this time cabin with a good bathtub and an always nice commodore breakfast unfortunately while listening to the excellent troubadour on deck i found that the male and female bartender were more interested in contactingtalkinglaughing with each other than serving me champagne i waited cs min before i managed to make eye contact with one i have previously tipped one of them in the form of banknotes so i do not understand this rejection result i no longer bought the champagne there from the two of them as a shareholder i want all the staff as everyone else does so well at pearl to look after the guests and serve the guests sincerely david nielsen mobile
excellent crossing smooth embarkation and disembarkationfood was great and indeed a surprise as i have never been on dfds before but would not hesitate to use their services again
went on a trip we had won from monday where the booking we made stated that we had to pay dkk per way and a further dkk which we would then receive as a gift certificate for use on the boat when we arrive on the boat on monday we are met by extremely unserviceable front desk employees who stubbornly claim that our gift certificate has now become a supplement due to easter and a full boat and that we therefore cannot get our gift certificate what our booking receipt clearly says gift certificate contacted their customer service when we arrived in oslo but was directed to email them about the problem which we can now wait weeks to get a response to beneath criticism and the worst is the lack of help from the front desk and a condescending and unpolished tone to answer us back in however i would like to say that we also met many nice employees around the boat but its such a shame that front desk workers have to steal the otherwise good experiences from the sweet and friendly staff the stars are also referred to very worn rooms bad beds and a great lack of cleaning we ourselves had to wipe off dried what we dare say was cola on the bed before we used it as well as dust and water from previous guests in the cups hanging in the bathroom not so delicious we have been away many times but this time was very disappointing
excellent crossing with dfds polite and friendly staff clean ship great food the best of the ferry companies in dover will definitely be using dfds again highly recommend
most ferries leave on time they are very comfortable recently renovated and the staff is friendly their app is very effective
the given agreements regarding the journey were fully respected good food and service the cabin nice and clean a little bit we had booked a shuttle bus both to and from the ferry the travel documents did not say where the bus stopped at the main station and at what time it cost several unnecessary calls
the guy at the car deck was really unfriendly and stubborn it was our st ferry experieme so we couldnt know allwe travelled with a disabled person and needed an elevator so we asked for it he almost shoutet on us and pointed cant u see there it is the crew upstairsall of them was wonderfully nice they helped and were just friendly
the ferry ride was an extraordinary pleasure the staff on board were courteous and friendly i am already looking forward to the next trip
easy to make reservations at attractive prices and without any hassle to book also good restaurants on board and very clean ferries
clean comfortable cabin slept well friendly polite staff very helpful had missed original ferry due to misunderstanding but staff dealt with it quickly and efficiently
clean room and through boat friendly staff smooth crossing a lot of noise heard through wall could hear what was being said would have not slept if it had been night time
the staff were friendly without being pushy overall the service was let down by the caos at the check in at calais though we learnt that dunkirque was on strike and was possibly a contributory factor i will be crossing with dfs again this year
you failed to inform us of a significant delay in the crossing from newhaven to dieppe the moment the ship left dieppe late early that morning it was always going to be a problem there was no explanation no announcements and we were just left waiting needlessly when you could have sent us all an email telling us to arrive an hour or so later my wife is diabetic and we we very concerned about when we would be able to get to the restaurant as she cannot go a long time with no food without serious health consequences next time tell us what is happening and not treat us like cattle
very good value for money the boat has been spruced up considerably its just such a shame that the internet is so rubbish it is free though but almost useless more often than not returning you are offline as far as i can tell from the dfds website their premium wifi service is not available on the newhaven route maybe it will be in the future i hope so
the service of the staff is excellent i just hoped when buying a mini cruise that there would be an evening program concert or games on the ferry there was a lack of activity in the evening but sailing was done with the idea of having fun not just getting from point a to point b
to be able to get on earlier ferry without additional costs
yesterday we drove from calais to dover on the ctes des flandres booking online was quick and easy checkin was also quick the ferry left the port of calais on time there are wide parking lanes on deck five and you can easily get in and out of the car the ship appears well maintained and clean including toilets there was freshly prepared food in the restaurant and despite the many hungry guests queuing for selfservice it was our turn after a few minutes and the food was delicious in addition to the selfservice restaurant we also discovered a pizzeria that has a large pirate playground for the children of course we liked the large outdoor deck that extends over two floors there is plenty of comfortable seating throughout the ship since we also know the two other ferry companies on the english channel dfds gave us the best impression so far
good ferry and clean only down side the suggested two hours check in before sailing time may be necessary on some sailings but remember the boy who called wolf unrealistic requests will eventually be ignored the reclining seats areas are no longer enclosed making them noisy
my recent experience with dfds was a complete disappointment during our booked mini cruise from ijmuiden to newcastle and back my partner and i were confronted with rough seas which resulted in severe seasickness and the inability to enjoy our preplanned course dinner at the north sea bistro but what was really shocking was the outrageous way dfds handled my complaint the staff on the boat indicated that it was no problem at all and that we could expect a full refund upon our return however upon returning home dfds refused to give us any form of refund it is absolutely outrageous that the staff on board made false promises that were not kept i understand that a company has a certain policy but it cannot be that the staff on the boat promises something that is not in line with the policy i also read here on trustpilot that another victim had exactly the same problem and received a refund after months first of all this tells me that my problem will also occur with others and will therefore not be solved secondly this reflects poorly on customer service i raised this with dfds but the response i received was that this person was lucky after many conversations with customer service we received an offer of two free threecourse meals with our next booking but what they dont understand is that im not really looking forward to another trip like this my situation at dfds has not yet progressed but i hope they will catch up if this is the case i will of course update my review to date i have asked to speak to a manager but the answer i get is quothe will say the same thing as me but less friendlyquot in short it is advertised with a nice trip for a low price but as as often is the case cheap is expensive
super efficient and friendly boarding a long queue at security before boarding but moved very quickly fabulous welcome from friendly staff very clean room perfect an evening of entertainment fantastic the only hiccup was a long wait at passport control in amsterdam probably due to brexit
had ordered commodore de luxe last year in nov and wanted them to be next to each other but dfds couldnt figure that out also heard from others that they had the same problem
ferry ran to time nice staff clean and comfortable thank you food was plain awful though all four breakfasts were really cold eggs not actually cooked booked ferry rather than train so we good have a decent meal not ideal
we had planned to take the midnight ferry but were told it was cancelled and wed have to take the when we arrived to check in for the we were told that there was no such sailing despite our printed ticket and wed have to get the midnight instead we did get a free upgrade to premium lounge which was nice but i wouldnt have paid extra for it and on the return we slept on the benches all the way back so it would have been wasted on us
i went with dfds from ijmuiden to newcastle and back booking spent time in scotland it was the last week of december first week january high season car seaview bunkbeds breakfast dinner return fare for persons was euro yrs and some months later i recently wanted to book exactly the same trip for the month of may it will cost over eurowhy my answer to the reply of dfds nonsense inflation calculator of the bank of england shows that goods and services costing in would now march be that still does not explain the increase of the remaining approx euros euros on top of the inflation why this calculator uses consumer price index cpi inflation data from the office for national statistics from onward monthly calculations of the current year are based on the latest cpi level
everything was nice clean and we had a great time on board the only downside to the trip was waiting pretty long until we could get off the boat this was due to passport control
for whatever reason my sailing was delayed by some minutes and consequently arrived at dover not just a smidgen after but at the time i got off the boat that of course may not be the fault of dfds but you have asked for my experience and this time that was it otherwise everything was fine and as ever staff crew were great
i have just returned from the dfds mini cruise to amsterdam fromto newcastle i have to say how organised the experience was the buscoach transfers etc the onboard crew on princess seaways were excellent could not do enough to help at all times the onboard buffet had a large variety available and again the staff were polite friendly and always there to help altogether a trip i enjoyed
if we need a ferry we always take dfds fast and uncomplicated checkin and process extremely userfriendly online booking wonderfully friendly staff especially on the return journey we got a goodie for our dog foldable bowl treats and a premium lounge upgrade thanks to the fabulous antony in the premium lounge due to technical waiting times we didnt find this annoying or too long all in all we would be happy to come back again
arrived early both leaving uk and returning the ferry operator managed to get me on an earlier sailing on both occasions the lunchtime menu was great and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal excellent quality on board facilities such as toilets were spotless
everything worked out fine as we were early on the ferry terminal we even got an earlier ferry without any extra charge i also got the information that our planned ferry was rescheduled to an minute time weeks before the traffic day
excellent trip with my eldest to watch a european football match ferry to dunkirk a great start good value and very efficient service with changes dealt with quickly and at no cost thanks
a trouble free trip from booking through to completion and you even managed to turn the dover straits into a millpond for us which as locals from deal we know is a very rare occasion
i arrived a bit early and was put on a more imminent crossing greatly pleasing didnt have to ask fuss free and thats a big thing when travelling
made welcome as soon as we arrived in newcastle port to book in staff very helpful as i needed assistance with husband in wheelchair the same on board ship in he restraunt and transfer by coach to amsterdam cannot praise your staff and company enough
we had a lovely crossing everything was fine except we booked in advance for our evening meal its supposedly cheaper but the booking didnt show on our reservation so we were charged full price disappointing
we had originally booked to travel from calais at we had this cancelled and were given a sailing of which was not an option as we could not make it so we had to go to dunkirk for the sailing as we were travelling there we had a text message saying that this sailing had been cancelled but to arrive at the port and we would be put on the earliest departure on looking up the sailings we found the earliest from dunkirk was but from calais the earliest was so we went to calais and caught that ferry together with hundreds of lively noisy children arriving home just in time to get to a hospital appointment with no sleep quite disgusted that we were not informed as to why the ferries were cancelled no one at the port was able to enlighten us and no apologies from anyone
excellent trip tel contact is difficult to get hence stars and not
staff polite helpful boat clean tidy information to return to car decks a bit late but good otherwise duty free perfume not much difference with trail prices
boat has had a refit really nice punctual and crew very polite its a good experience
missing info about delay departure lake at on arrival at received information about a hour delay but no ferry arrived towards oslo before and there was no info on the expected departure time neither to waiting cars with tired passengers nor in the departure terminal the dfd staff here knew nothing and generally they said had no contact withto the captainmate same discussion among dfds staff on the ferry dfds must be able to do better answer from dfds is not dealing with the fact that there was no information about the delay or expected departure delays can of course happen but dfds must have processespreparedness for this dfds always has staff on site who should be able to get information a terminal on site dfds can display information on or smsemail can be sent to waiting customers in the queue other transport companies have long since updated their customer service regarding delays
smooth experience easy to get on and off ferry staff lovely
hello the service entertainement food etc on board was perfect both ways but the entry at ukcustoms brexit did cost us valuable time for sightseeing in newcastle we lost hours at customs we were pedestrians the way back in ijmuiden the entry was done in minutes perfect ununderstandable as all passport details were given in advance and were checked again in ijmuiden recommendation please let passengerscustomers know in advance that uk entry can take very long due to this situation brexit we are not planning a further uk trip
we traveled on th march newhaven to dieppe on the am crossing we only travel this route with dfds as we find their service to be first class and we feel they offer a more personalised service compared to other carriers staff are always very polite and helpful the upgraded ferries have larger duty free shops and comfortable seating we had a sea view cabin so we could have a sleep before driving through france which was comfortable offering a bit of your own space breakfast was lovely a welcome meal before a long car drive all in all another excellent crossing from dfds
our recent minicruise to newcastle with dfds was fantastic the cabins were clean and comfortable and the onboard cafes and bars provided a great variety of options the only downside was the short duration we wished it could have been longer overall it was a delightful experience
its always nice on these trips everything from the employees the offers both in shops restaurants and the entertainment the only thing that detracted from star is that the coffee shop at both pearl and crown does not have normal lowfat milk for the coffee only whole milk and many other types of milk all of which make the morning coffee both far too strong and far too sweet but again thats just a detail in the whole thing on our last voyage crown our sink was unfortunately clogged in the cabin we reported it and it was fixed while we were in copenhagen and worked perfectly on the way back have traveled with dfds many times and it was the first time i experienced something like this but as i said the message was well received and fixed right away so the trip was great
i was concerned about travelling by ferry as i had not used one for years but dfds made everything easy this is the only time i have ever given stars for anything all staff were polite and helpful i can not find fault
rush trip march to attend a family funeral in north holland myself and disabled wife both ways staff could not have been more friendly or helpful both on shore and on board disabled lift and wheelchair supplied very good as was the food in the cafeteria however on the way out we were delayed in dover for and a half hours because of a ship being in the wrong berth and exactly the same thing happened on the way back probably not the fault of dfds but annoying when you have a long drive to get to your destination not the first time i have travelled with dfds and it certainly wont be the last apart from the delays a very good service
my recent trip from newhaven to dieppe was excellent value for money and was a safe comfortable and efficient service with knowledgeable and friendly welcoming staff on shore and on board i would recommend dfds to anyone who is planning a trip to france or continental europe
great time on king seaways boat with a newly refurbished room new room didnt have a radio though beds clean comfy no complaints
this is the best ferry ever for those of us who live in northern england or scotland overnight to amsterdam and away you go no awful drive to or from the south coast of england
first time travelling on ferry and it was a truly enjoyable experience onboard crew were very helpful journey wiled away pleasantly buffet style restaurant food was of high standard with plenty of options for evening meal and breakfast first time travelling with dfds likely not the last
everything was good and efficient and we were allowed to take an earlier ferry with no hassle and at no extra cost
hello everything is fine but the ferry was delayed a lot thanks to the bolt driver i made it to the bus on time the internet on the ferry is not working well even though the full package was purchased i think its time to have starlink already
since the closure of eurotunnels frequent traveller ticket option and the exorbitant post covid price rises leshuttle charges even for midweek nighttime out of season tickets i looked elsewhere for my options to drive my car between southern uk and france and my option of choice is now dfds the ships depart ontime are clean modern offer a smoother journey in choppy seas compared to legacy ferries and i get a chance to relax and grab a bite to eat or drink when onboard oh and the dutyfree prices are far better that the eurotunnel shop so overall dfds offers me excellent service and value
we are regular visitors to europe and always travel with dfds to either calais or dunkirk we booked all three of our trips for this year early with an early bird discount which made our trips a little cheaper staff are always lovely and the check in is quick
difficulty with the booking system i wanted a return ticket but the system was changing the outbound date to the return date so ended up having to book a single however as i had been delayed and had gone back to the website times over a few hours in the hope it was working correctly in the middle of my booking the price increased from to as it was pm and i needed to travel next day very disappointed actual journey checkin etc was fine
had several good trips with children and grandchildren to oslo with dfds however i unfortunately have to note that the last trip was different the evening buffet in steven sea has deteriorated considerably and the same is unfortunately the breakfast buffet so we are somewhat disappointed the rooms were clean and neat and the childrens entertainment was top notch
first time travelling dfds newcastle to amsterdam we had a week off work and live just mins from ferry port at north shields so booked the day mini cruise on arriving at the terminal we found check in really easy and staff very helpful and friendly boarding the ferry was easy and quick once on board staff were very helpful and friendly we originally booked a twin room with window however once onboard upgraded to commodore classic room which was immaculate and perfect size for of us the outward journey was unfortunately very rough and difficult to cope with even with sea sick tsblets so we didnt explore as much of the ferry as we wouldve liked instead we stayed in room unfortunately the buffet in the explorers restaurant was excellent so much choice and high quality we chose to book this over the restaurant as my husband is a very fussy eater and felt this gave the most choice great value too if pre booked next morning we had breakfast in the blue ribband restaurant where again staff were excellent and food fabulous leaving the ferry in amsterdam took a while as the air bridge couldnt be attached so in the end we had to leave via car deck staff in amsterdam border control were polite and friendly the coaches into amsterdam were of a great standard the journey took about mins and it wouldve been useful to have a person on board giving us some info on how to get to the main areas or hints and tips on things to do when we were dropped off it was a short min walk into city we went on one if the many canal tours which was very relaxing and informative about the history of amsterdam we had a lovely lunch before wandering along a few streets near the canals to pick up a few souvenirs we especially liked the cheese deli shop we then headed back to the coach for pm whilst it is a very short visit we managed to pack in quite a lot boarding the ferry was fairly quick and we were soon back in our room going for evening meal again was much more pleasant as the sea was much calmer on our return crossing food and service were both excellent arriving into port is a bit of a rush but we stayed in room mins after announcement to leave and this meant we werent queuing as much going through border control takes a little time but the staff were working hard to get everyone through as quickly as possible and were all very polite and helpful we will definitely do this trip again but will stay in a hotel for nights to allow us more time to exolore amsterdam all in all an excellent break
a couple of days after booking our next trip to calais from dover had to amend the car details same make and model but different reg number charged for the pleasure still weeks to go before we sail so just money making by the ferry company
crew as helpful and smiling from the booking in and boarding and service onboard i travel most months with dfds and always the samewell done and look forward to many more journeys
everything was well organized or manageable unfortunately dfds could not do anything about the wild sea
good conditions on the ship good service difficult to get off and away from the ship in copenhagen
we used dfds to travel from newcastle to amsterdam and back we arrived at the port to check in and were asked if we wanted to book on meals as it was cheaper to do this at port rather than on the boat we enquired about room upgrade which we were told this can be done on board we proceeded to pay for our additional meals breakfast and tea we boarded onto the boat very simply and headed to guest services to ask about room upgrade this was done with ease we moved onto a commodore sea view cabin which was beautiful and spacious enough for both myself and my partner although this upgrade came with free breakfast so wed lost out on money paying for breakfast at the port which we wasnt informed about so bare this in mind if you plan on upgrading your room onboard onboard there are a variety of things to do such as a cinema showing up to films lounge areas arcade room club with live entertainment open until late the drinks are fairly reasonable between per cocktail for soft drinks etc and the staff are very friendly we ate at the restaurant on deck the food was luxury level and left me and my partner feeling very full we then spent the night in the club playing bingo and listening to live music the boat was very rocky which didnt bother us for the most part of the journey but something to keep in mind for those who dont deal well with motion overall we had an amazing trip and would love to do this experience again
on time and excellent facilities onboard customer service was also top rate i changed both my crossing at short notice without any hassle and at a nominal extra charge
we were waiting outside hour from check in till we were in the ferry i think we were missed only later ferry go back to collect last minivans so in pm food in the restorant was cold
nice employees and a quotquietquot crossing although with many loud guests on the trip from cphoslo company trip too bad we hadnt booked on one of the rest instead of the seas buffet in addition we found out that crossing by car on weekdays is ub but we had paid dkk in total hope we get the money back as it was an expensive crossing for us next time we fly
we were late getting in to amsterdam and then we stood at the port for over an hour waiting to get off the ship and through security all this meant we only ended up with hours in amsterdam and no time to do the things we had booked
when we had to board in oslo we were asked to drive up the ramp to the passenger car deck we refused this as we had paid for a quothigh carquot from home when last year we experienced damage to our car when we had to drive up the ramp and got stuck where the ramp quotbreaksquot our car is lowered and therefore it is not that high the staff tells us that it cannot be right that we have paid for quothigh carquot as this has been abolished we must show our ticket which states that we have paid for quothigh carquot this requires a call from the staff on the ship to before we are allowed to drive on to the truck deck we find it critical that we are assigned the wrong seat just as the staffs statement that quothigh carquot has been abolished a long time ago is false as we subsequently try to buy a ticket and here we can choose quothigh carquot
great service prompt and very helpful when we missed our ferry on the way back got us on the next to depart immediately
the newly refurbished ferries are comfortable clean the crossing was on time easy to check in board
very good ticket buying experience very good embarking and disembarking experience comfortable cabin and beautiful premises on the ferry excellent food and service excellent trip thank you very much
rather bad experience we are a family of and we booked a cabin with seaside view i ordered a nonnoisy but got one right above the discotheque and on our return trip we got a cabin closer to the engine room which resulted in no sleep because of noise and vibrations from the engine my family was not happy about my booking will not book this ferry again
it was such a shame your duty free was taken over by the airport gang they dont understand that english people like a big majority of people who sail cross channel prefer great english beer to the fizzy p they sell some oik tried to sell me the line that you couldnt source s hen in france why bother trying you require payment in so i guess youre buying in so get it from the brewer
very clean and comfortable and no problem to travel on earlier ferry
cosy and well kept ship welcoming and friendly crew great wiews good timetable with plenty of time on board
smooth check in good duty free selection friendly staff both on shore and on board plenty of room on board and very cleancomfotable would have been stars but left minutes late and unloaded minutes after scheduled arrival time
my partner and i had the best time onboard the boat the entertainment was spot on and the staff were great couldnt do enough for us and very friendly we are definitely looking to book on the princess again for another weekend away
all went to plan no hitches the ferry was very clean and all the team pleasant
i am very positively impressed we were able to check in very early so everything was relaxed and stressfree we were able to get into the cabin a good hour before departure which made it more comfortable for our dog the cabin is big enough and everything you need is there the ship has everything your heart desires taxfree food dancing everything is there i will definitely travel with dfds again and can only recommend it if you are traveling with a dog
great staff at all stages booking checkin on board easy booking process smart clean ships with a good food and drink offering good duty free shop on board and in calais port
the ship was lovley and clean and lots of seating avaliable the food on board was awful quality and not much choice the queuing was awful only person on the till at breakfast so the food was cold when finally got through but people standing around not doing anything the loading on the return journey was traumatic as we were loaded onto the lorry deck and boxed into a corner on purple deck when we returned to the deck we could not get to our vehicle due to the lorries the steward didnt care and just shrugged his shoulders when we asked how to get to our vehicle the lorries engines were on and it was very frightening eventually he realised we needed help and gestured to walk right to the front of the boat and around the lorries to get to our vehicle worst experience ever on a car deck and as a frequent traveller it takes a lot to shake me but it was pretty bad
couldnt amend my ticket online so turned up at the port and was charged to get the next ferry which only had other cars and was minutes late departing
easy boarding ship staff helpful and courteous smooth crossing in chopping seas arriving within minutes of expected time then easy departure just what you want on a return home stress free travel
really good sailing trip nice clean cabin good and friendly service and management both in the restaurant and service centre the food really well prepared breakfast commodore guests in the explorer restaurant has everything served in a very delicious way and is freshly prepared unlike before there are no longer any problems whatsoever to preorder a course menu and then on the day change it to course and have the difference made up in the drinks hooray for that i am surprised that every time you buy anything in a taxfree shop you have to show your boarding pass what is the boarding card information used for which information is stored and for how long does it comply with gdpr rules which i assume also apply on the dfds ship
generally a pleasant journey but due to rebooking it gave an extra hours of travel time for an aarhusian it just gave a little extra km and extra catering expense we had chosen sea side seatings reclining chairs for the journey home it was a very noisy experience with noise from the deck above and from the kitchen next door
waited over an hour for our cabin to be ready with no warning it would take so long other floors were ready before ours so they must have been understaffed but still information would have been helpful after paying so much this was disappointing
it was bad i was with a school and the man serving was severely against us i asked him for no baked beans and he gave me baked beans and when i pointed it out where i would have expected him to do the meal again he told me basically to suck it up and to leave them i dont expect this service in a normal on land restaurant so why does it have to change this was just one guy and the majority of the other staff were nice with a couple of anomalies the majority of which staff were just being unhelpful although again there were problems with vending machines i would like to say this has only happened once but i have noticed on any dfds ferry i go on similar issues seem to occur overall nice crossing but the staff let it down
easy booking proces gooed price comfort on board entertainment and food on board bus for transfer
sea was rough passengers fell over with young people tripping and many feeling sick staff tried to help but there was no reassurance nor adequate communication at no point people in charge had the situation under control i wonder what would have happened in case of injuries or worse a rather dreadful experience
nice quick cross over from europe boarding and customs are greatly improved so is the vip lounge
the mere fact that i have sailed with dfds from an early age and continue to do so says enough a very satisfied passenger
i think we were quite lucky with the weather for the time of year but i enjoyed this quick trip to amsterdam from newcastle the only really painful part of the experience was the uk border force at newcastle on return i know they have a job to do but somehow doubt serious criminals terrorists smugglers or others who would be denied entry would turn up at a port like newcastle so this is just a show delaying tourists and returning citizens in a queue for up to an hour to pretend something is being done food on the boat was good we had the buffet dinner and breakfast personally id have preferred fried eggs to scrambled but you cant have everything room was comfortable enough we had the berth bunk beds with ensuite prices in the bars werent extortionate live band wasnt much to our taste but we found the other bar had better beer anyway
boat was dirty dunkirkdover late leaving pirt and late arriving at dover sea state was calm items missing from the disabled toilet poor signage to port very disappointed
been on a mini cruise with dfds which should have been an experience with good food and dancing in the nightclub the food and service were fine but in the nightclub there were oceans of children running around wildly and playing hide and seek the overturned chairs ran up the long windowsills and shouted and screamed at pm there were only children years old running around on the dance floor while a lousy band played music went to the reception and explained the problem they agreed with us and could tell that there were children on this trip also because of mgp dfds could have informed about this on their website then we would never have chosen this trip which was a mutual adult gift we have never experienced anything like this and we have been with dfds mini cruise at least times over the years but we will never do it again our trip was ruined suggested solution no children aged in the nightclub after pm then its for the adult audience
efficient check in procedure flexible when you arrive early in the port and there is an earlier departure
it is always pleasant to travel with dfds boat as a child with many good experiences and activities but the cleaning in the commodore cabin was so bad a lot of dust on the table unhygienic toilet with an irritating noise from the ventilation in the bathroom i informed reception but nothing was done
easy boarding arrived just in time to board the earlier ferry which we were rushed onto literally minutes before it sailed previously po refused boarding and made us sit and watch for mins whilst it continued to prepare and then sailed away nice on board good prices nice staff
i always cross with you both for cost and service i made a mistake booking my return from calais not dunkirk but upon arrive the very nice lady just changed it over no fuss no charge no making me feel stupid so thanks for that the only reason its not stars was the boat is tired and only had bow thruster working so we had to wait for hrs outside dover waiting for the only berth the ship could dock but saying that the staff were very transparent it what was going on and gave us a free drink all the staff i spoke to all said dfds was a good company to work for which i think is great
boat didnt go no excuses just a text message hours before departure ridiculous
it takes too long after the ferry also goes to frederikshavn a departure at the earliest and arrival around or maybe would be practical when you are on a skiing holiday you arrive so late in the day that there is no time to ski on the same day and on the return day there is only time for the drive as the ferry already leaves at
ferry terminal straightforward checking in and we left on time good food and helpful staff to assist with parking
to long time to get out of foutit took hour to drive out after coming
for me as a truck driver this time it was very disappointing i traveled with the athena seaways from dunkirk to rosslare the young man at the reception was rude the evening meal was awful for my taste and there was just not much to choose from the breakfast was also very sparse i have already traveled with dfds ferries where there was a very extensive buffet for lunch dinner and breakfast if the next trip is with the athena seaways again i will politely decline
we travel frequently from amsterdam to newcastle thank you for pet area on deck great idea makes travel with dog complete
love the ferry best way to get to amsterdam always on time accommodation great and facilities on board excellent a most relaxing way to travel
checked in straightforward ferry left on time a good priced breakfast and comfortable seating
very attentive crew great crossing despite the delays due to weather
newly refurbished ship nice crew
ease of booking a reservation online ease of checkingin on the day of travel helpful and courteous staff shore based at dover and at calais and all the ferry staff at sea
making booking outbound was unstable on dfds app as price shown was incorrect so went to direct ferries which seems pointless as its a loss to dfds overall experience as always was exceptional but would like to see a loyalty programme
kept to time as much as possible weather permitting lovely personnel welcoming and friendly gave me a place on an earlier ferry no delay i know it was a later ferry on a monday but still
top including by being able to leave earlier on an earlier earlier boat furthermore friendly staff very nice
easy to switch to another ferry when we arrived early welldone friendly employees on board
ease of checking in change to time of sailing without any problems
pleasantly surprised we arrived early for our am departure ferry on saturday the th of february the very pleasant lady in the kiosk allowed us to board the pm ferry which was fantastic gave my son a kids pack and issued us our lounge passes which we paid a little extra for when booking we parked up the car headed to the lounge entered our code for access very smooth we were greeted by a very pleasant lady who explained all the benefits of the lounge to us plus offered to serve us fresh sandwiches even at this late hour lounge was great free wifi comfy sofa a little sleep then at am fresh pastries and croissants the service was very very good in fact we wanted to stay on the ferry even longer as it was so comfortable the toilet was immaculate clean and fresh smelling compared to the slightly more tired toilets away from the lounge all in all a perfect trip a little sleep food and drinks and still better value than the tunnel thank you dfds richard clynes
friendly and helpful employees we travel with dfds from dunkirk or calais to dover several times a year from dover on the way back when the journey to dover went faster than expected we were offered the opportunity to get an earlier boat back than we had reserved
arrived hours before the ferry was due to sail it was already in port despite this they didnt start to load until mins before departure time unsurprisingly we were mins late departing dieppe this resulted in a delayed arrival in newhaven to make matters worse despite being the second car to board the ferry hr and mins after arriving in port we were still waiting to get off the ferry basically due to incompetence or indifference of the deck crew once off the ferry we were then faced with a huge queue to immigration control eventually being one of the last cars to leave the port hr and mins after arrival be aware that there are next to no facilities at either newhaven or dieppe
so easy with dfds great value too rooms were clean and tidy and staff helpful just wish they operated out of portsmouth
booking was easy and changes over the phone were very easy and helpful the crossing accommodation and catering were excellent
unclear time of boarding facilities at ports france very poor on board ship seating limited and areas closed off staff however were very friendly and apologetic
outbound trip we got there early and were allowed to get on the next available ferry return journey the same no problem all staff encountered were really friendly cannot fault any part of the service
i had to reschedule my trip to france from christmas to the february half term got told that it was too late and i had to pay for a new ticket i will switch to eurotunnel for my next trips so much easier dealing with changes
for the second time running i was one of the first to arrive at newhaven yet got directed on boarding to the last place to be unloaded this time my vehicle was literally the last to leave the terminal i was so annoyed that it affected my driving your response to my first complaint was smug effectively no one was that late leaving the port so whats your beef so i know complaints have no effect this is such a basic lack of customer care that i wonder what the point is in you seeking customer opinions
loved all the newly refurbished bits of the ship but there didnt seem enough staff on we stopped in commodore deluxe the front vip room was always left in a mess and wasnt stocked we had to ask for cups we only saw a member of staff once in the whole trip with no way to find one as the phones had been removed paid vip but didnt feel like we was we have used dfds many times and mostly booked commodore or deluxe in the past but i feel it might be a waste of money please can dfds go back to the way you were other companies help you on and off the ship giving you the full vip experience for the same money the free breakfast was shocking we were forced into a small room on the side blue ribbon over crowded with no view and cold food ive never written a bad review before but i feel ive had to sorry
both out ound and inbound were good trips even allowed us to take an earlier ferry without cost which helped
awful customer service i want to make a booking one way calais dover which seems impossible on dfds website ie it seems impossible to select a one way booking inbound to the uk i went on the online chat facility which said i was first in the queue i remained in this position obviously the chat line is understaffed or not staffed at all i then found the number for customer services not obvious called them and first of all enquired why i should pay p a minute to make a booking the operative agreed to call me back and of course did not i used dfds twice last year on return crossings newhaven dieppe their customer service is hopeless and literally non existent fortunately this is a very competitive route and i will book elsewhere because dfds obviously doesnt want the business
highway robbery is probably the best term the journey time is now without a stop in fredrikshavn hours departure at and arrival at am this is done solely to save fuel ie a pure and large extra profit for dfds previously the journey time with departure at and arrival no later than it has become colossally expensive round trip with a car regular size and the cheapest interior cabin was dkk twice as expensive from oslo to copenhagen as from copenhagen to oslo service on board is slow it only took minutes to be allowed to ordermaybe not that much with one you only have an hour and a half in total wine prices in restaurants and bars are basically on a better restaurant in the country in the store i went through the entire wine range without finding a single wine that was cheaper than you can drive it ashore thoughtprovoking for the sole reason that it states that the prices are tax free in copenhagen you could get on board two hours before departure in oslo we had to wait nicely in the cars until there were minutes until departure all in all a terribly poor experience
simply good departure on time the ship was clean there is nothing to complain about
staff very helpful polite ferry was very clean
dfds provided a wonderful trip the poor flow at customs on the way there and back puts a dampener on the trip
no queues at check in quick efficient loading tasty lunch on board friendly service from all staff children loved the soft play area ferry ran on time would struggle to suggest an improvement thank you
always use dfds and have a great experience fast loading not too much waiting and boat is always clean and tidy which they stocked st omer beer onboard like they have in the duty free shop in calais though
it was very unclear when we could get on board the ship in frederikshavn so we spent a long time finding that out read both on the website the chat and called twice however we couldnt get on as early as we were been told we boarded the ferry at the time they said we were sailing in addition i called in and had it written on our booking for the cabin that we would like bed horses was told that it wasnt always that they read what was written so it wasnt safe that they were there when we got to the cabin there were no sleeping horses and we asked her for them and they said that someone would come by with some for us they never came and our son fell out of bed because there were no bed rails on so that and the unclear boarding made us a little dissatisfied everything else was fine
quick processing through gate long long wait to get on the ship which is better than long wait at gate then long wait to get on ship positioned near lift which was good disabled but we had a cabin so being near the bow lift would have been better but we never are staff really polite and helpful aboard ship ship had a cosmetic refit which wasis good too although i think there is now a much smaller seating area which is not
so much different from rail way or airline ticket useless information about time of departure not possible to check in online unlike airlines not possible to arrive at time of departure unlike trains with need to be careful no online checkin arrived after checkin closing ferry is gone
they didnt want to let me travel with a van privately owned insured and taxed want to me to pay extra my first trip was cancelled by them at short notice with i had to changed all my arrangements costing me money company to avoid
very smooth crossing to holland staff very helpful and ferry had lots of things to do whilst on board we loved the food choices especially vegetarian and lower sugar options would not have bunk beds next time as top bunk was unuseable for us not sufficient headroom to manoeuvre and hard mattress after climbing up there better for children to use than year olds we thought on balance we enjoyed the trip and would definitely travel with dfds again
please think twice if you are looking to travel with dfds as if you have a problem and require a refund you could be waiting a very long time julien dehais who is the companys so called customer relation and interaction specialist has been promising me a refund since th january despite numerous emails and requests for him to call me which he doesnt do by the way no funds have been forthcoming absolutely disgusting service from someone who is meant to deal with their customers complaints
hadnt tried a trip with the oslo boat before and was a bit excited because i had read bad reviews but couldnt recognize anything the cabin was nice and clean sweet and friendly staff there was something for everyone and didnt think the prices were as high as people had mentioned on the boat we will come again with our two children
liked the cabins friendly staff on board disliked the long queues for check in and passport control takes too long to get off the boat
outward sat rd of february return friday th it is the same route two entirely different experiences with dfds newcastle to ijmuiden and return hence it would be an average of or it would be newcastle outward we sailed on the princess after an initial hospitable welcome we were led across the level car deck pointed in the general direction of our deck outside the twobed cabin after wandering around we did find our cabin the cabin was compact but clean unfortunately deck sounds directly above the engine we chose to eat dinner at the buffet which was well tastefully decorated with accommodating staff the food was as good as a buffet in a good hotel breakfast was again a buffet and as good as the previous evening now the negatives there is insufficient casual seating for those looking for quiet space most seating on the boat is either in pubs or restaurants or coffee bars to squeeze profit euros an hour for internet access in this day and age departure from the boat was chaotic we struggled on stairways with heavy cases and backpacks while disney fixed smiling staff watched on not thinking to point out the tiny lift homeward journey on the king oh dear if this crossing werent so close to scotland i would not use the service again beyond the initial staff member with a fixed disney smile and customary welcome we were left to fend for ourselves trying to find our way to the cabin searching for our cabin on the wrong side of the boat we lugged our heavy cases up two flights of stairs and down two at the others side of the ship staff were harassed and food was not as well prepared as on the outward journey in the morning the cooked breakfast was abysmal bacon had the texture of jerky and risked fracturing teeth if anyone could cook bacon i would hope it would be the danish being a major supplier of this meat there was no brown bread for toasting they used the cheapest white available think lidil or aldi budget brand based on the cooked breakfast options if i were to travel again i would skip the buffet breakfast and have coffee and pastry instead unfortunately there is no affordable alternative to the buffet dinner if you dont want to upgrade to fine dining potentially there would have been the same exit experience as the voyage on the princess but we had found the small lift which made life so much easier what would make a difference in dfs if you are reading better staff training simple things like recognising when people are struggling with luggage and checking tickets to give clear instructions on what side of the boat the cabins can be found consistency of quality and table service across the buffet restaurants on both ships more occasional seating for those who want quiet space away from caf bars and night club
friendly staff on board no hour long queues and delays or gestapolike border control officers that you get when crossing with eurotunnel p
comfortable clean ferry easy to book and reasonable price
bj i have been a ferry customer for over years i cross every months with my family and mother in brighton i have known all the ships since villandry and valency there i had the experience of the revamped seven sisters its the worst ive experienced ridiculously high store more beautiful stairs leading to the bar tables and seats tight i think passing with wheelchair very complicated certainly idea of charging inclined seats while enjoying the noise from the childrens play area with separating walls in claire lane all these changes and yet ladies toilet block on deck out of service and in the nd hand dryer which does not work it was much better before fortunately my frequent crossings are over with the recent death of my mother i am shocked by these changes which for me only bring negatives sincerely
it was my first time travelling as a wheelchair user so was a bit nervous the staff were amazing and went above and beyond to help from me parking near the lifts to finding my way around the ferry and finding out the answers to questions i had about being in france i am now planning on going over regularly as it was such a positive experience i do feel that i wasnt treated any differently except for the parking near the lifts and that this is the level of customer service that dfds provides
a great crossing between dover and calais much better than another company that begins with a p and ends with an o will use dfds for all future bookings
as usual fuss free ferry crossing helpful staff and good coffee
i will allow myself to say that unfortunately the limit was reached on our trip home from oslo to copenhagen for what it must cost my family and i travel often which means once approx every year with dfds from copenhagen to oslo also this year when we had planned a ski trip to trysil happy to pay for good cabins read commodore de luxe and for good food in one of your many restaurants on our trip home from oslo we chose to eat buffet in restaurant seas adults and children at and years we adults ordered wine and soda with the meal as the children aged and do not drink soft drinks we chose to order water in glasses for them glasses in total when we got the bill it read among other things of x dkk for the glasses of water a total of dkk for liters of water i think is quite rude knowing that we adults paid for wine and soft drinks and for a buffet for people i am sitting with a big big disappointment and which i unfortunately choose to share on fb and on trustpilot and when i am next invited to take part in a survey from you kind regards sren thomsen booking no
departure from and arrival at fredrikshavn is ruined by an endless walk to and from the boat before you know it you are driven all the way to checkin on departure and picked up there on arrival with sore legs and a back that cant handle the long walk it ruins the travel experience signage on board is inadequate otherwise the trip was nice with pleasant and helpful staff
im sorry its so bad to reach you have a game or a good offer it only applies to kbh and never from north jutland sorry its deplorable
pleasant staff informative and helpful boat was the refurbished seven sisters all clean and comfortable
the staff were excellent at accommodating us as our travel plans had changed beyond our control many thanks for the clean boat and nice accommodation
all went pretty smoothly when ferries around seemed to be substantially delayed quick boarding and landing not crowded and only a few minutes late departure
racket on gsm via satellite antennas on dfds ships from calais to dover while we receive the gsm network on both sides of the channel my gsm connected to the uk network in calais with an sms from free to me informing of gb in uk included in my package before switching to the ships network minutes later billing of per free mobile for mb at per mb no information is given by dfds on these shameful practices see your answer there were of us and no one saw or heard any information on this subject during our time on board a warning in big and red in your information emails received a week before your crossing with dfds is approaching would be a minimum to show your honesty on the subject
went online to book a ferry from dieppe to newhaven choose the ferry option which costs pounds add my cabin for pounds and then once i have created an account and just before i am about to enter my payment details a pop up tells me this price is no longer available but i can accept a new price that is pounds more sneaky tactics dont like
clean facilities staff friendly and helpful cool on the boat when sitting around for the journey hot food just satisfactory but plenty of choice overall crossing is good value for money and we will continue to use and recommend
totally rubbish checkin system at dover multiple queues and multiple checkin points some are fast some are slow choose the wrong queue and youll miss your ferry we waited for min for our checkin point to let us through while cars arriving after us went through simply because they chose a different queue our checkin point had a computer problem but no one at dfds could seem to sort out a queue system that would be fair meaning you are served in the order you arrive improvement needed dfds
i traveled with my yearold son who has autism tourettes adhd and ocd all the staff were amazing and my son got a tour of the bridge met the captain and got a tour of the engine room it was so nicely done by dfds and i am deeply grateful for their way of accommodating my son
yes its not my story but one i got from an autism forum on facebook but i thought dfds should have credit for such a story on trustpilot as well some may remember my last post about my son and his huge interest in the oslo ferry on monday his christmas present had to be redeemed a trip to oslo it turned out to be a trip he will never forget again a week before we were to leave for oslo i spontaneously wrote an email to dfds and told them about jonathan and how excited he is about the oslo ferry and how much he has studied everything about the ferry you can wake him up in the middle of the night and ask him about size weight speed yes anything and youll get an answer i asked if there was any possibility for him to perhaps be allowed to greet an employee see something backstage or something completely different however i had not received any response from dfds so i thought that they did not have the option minutes after we had set sail i was called by the captain who had received my email and he really wanted to say hello to jonathan we were picked up by a manager followed up to the bridge where the captain was waiting for us then followed an experience of full hour where jonathan had a long talk with the captain who showed jonathan how to steer the ferry and then jonathan was put to steer the ferry suddenly a call was made on a walkie talkie it was a sailor who was supposed to talk to jonathan and ask if he could fix the anchor jonathan was told what to answer and talked back and forth on the walkietalkie then a chat with the nd mate who showed around the bridge and jonathan was greeted by the chief of staff after about half an hour we were followed down into the machine room by another employee and were handed over to the machine manager who showed jonathan around the entire machine room we got to see everything from the engine the screws the cylinders the tanks and where everything from the toilets ends up and is filtered both the captain and the chief engineer were blown away by talking to jonathan and they were somewhat surprised by jonathans vast knowledge of all the technical aspects of the ferry there was talking laughing and yawning jonathan can hardly contain himself over the huge experience and i am deeply deeply deeply grateful that dfds would give him that experience now jonathan is looking forward to march which is his birthday and of course it must be celebrated on oslo ferry
the usual high quality service from all the crew left promptly and arrived slightly early at newhaven good crossing and again a great experience with great service my crossing of choice well done
spot on hardly tealised we were under way it was that smooth left and arrived bang on time check in procedure etc very slick well impressed with onboard facilities for what is a pretty small ship seven sisters
weve used the dfds dieppe to newhaven and return crossing for many years we dont need luxurious cabins just somewhere clean and comfortable after a long drive either side of the channel and thats what they are on the cote dalbatre the floor coverings in the cabins are a little the worse for wear but these are hard working ships yesterday we did the h sailing from newhaven and were on the seven sisters which is really rather smart we didnt use a cabin this time as it was a day sailing so cannot comment on those this time dfds staff both on the phones for booking or enquiries and on the ships are pleasant friendly polite and professional using the phone to book i am always offered the over s discount too this is a hardworking ferry line but the food is decent the ships are clean the duty free shop on the seven sisters was well stocked bright and pleasant the biggest thing this company get totally right though is the pricing it is absolutely right we shall continue to use dfds because we love good value for money and a simple professional service
nicely laid out ship which had obviously been recently refurbished plenty of room for all passengers travelling new reclining chairs were comfortable however it was over an hour after docking that we eventually drove off which was frustrating many large lorries had to be offloaded before the cars on our deck could disembark
the service was very good the staff were very polite and friendlyprocess of booking in and boarding the ship is very straightforward all the facilities were fantastic on boardgreat ship modern and new but facilities while waiting in the port of dover is very basic and limited just a porta cabin toilet block and vending machine unlike calais which has large duty free shop and cafe facilities still i have used this service in the past and will be booking again in the future
great staff crew and as a regular user of dfds i rate the ferry company highly
right on time and when we came back changing to one ferry earlier was no problem very kind crew also in the restorant
easy to book online efficient port processing and staff efficiency ferry was very clean and excellent well priced breakfast offered in restaurant
first of all why prices go up from euros to euros per vehicle what is the explanation for it second ferry is late hours and only at the counter i heard that third internet on the boat is tragic pay euros for full ride but it is so slow and even disapears for some time award only for staff and kitchen they are doing good job there
the journey was fine many people but as it is its a pity that you cant book an appointment in den italienske restaurant when you can in others expensive trip had booked a return trip for approx dkk but then ordered separate trips out and home which then became cheaper they didnt tell me that all in all very satisfied otherwise
this was my th yes th crossing over the last years and i continue to avail myself of dfds services so dfds must be doing something right friendly efficient and helpful staff minimum fuss for boardingdisembarking thats the something i give four out of five stars because i never give a fifth there is always something remaining to be improved for example how about a special faithful customers discount for longterm users like me keep on going dfds you are on the right course thank you
clean well managed vessel for embarking and disembarking nice and warm cabin friendly staff one of my best crossings
boat was on time departing and arrivingfriendly helpful staff
not a good experience before the trip it starts with the preparations for the trip i tried to create an account via the app this didnt work then i made contact by telephone but that was very difficult for example the number does not always work the music in the queue is very disturbing the person on the phone was not customer friendly i had to provide personal data times i had already done this online twice once by telephone and later via chat speaking of the chat the customer service there was also very bad when its finally your turn it takes about half an hour before you get a response half of your questions will remain unanswered and the chat will be closed without mercy or any notice during the trip we had booked the dinner buffet twice which was absolutely nothing to write home about so when we wanted to cancel it for the return trip that was a huge problem and that was absolutely not possible after my opinion the response to this was also not polite and customerfriendly it couldnt happen no explanation no reason the boat was very clean the times of arrival were neatly announced and getting on and off the boat went well however i would not use dfdss services again
great company to sale with lovely staff and ships are always really clean we will be booking another crossing with you very soon thank you to you all
great customer service quotlauraquotquotlaraquot helped us a lot with booking our trip to england we will definitely book again highly recommended
not up to the usual standards we have come to expect from dfds boat itself was ok but ran late despite signs at the port saying everything was running on time boat itself was clean and comfortable to a point had a nice coffee but accompanied by a rather tired muffin journey was made a little unpleasant by some unruly school parties whilst staff made some limited attempts to curb the worst of it i was of the view that the accompanying teachers should have been made to take proper control
i was very impressed with the service booking was not difficult but i was disappointed that i was charged extra when i had to make changes of dates
liked a ships officer made a great effort to find out about autoroute blockages in northern france because of farmers protests liked all members of staff very welcoming friendly disliked shop didnt accept my french bank card only uk card or euros in cash this is very poor for a ship assuring the link to a french port
i booked a cruise from to everything went well here even if you didnt want to leave minutes after you had booked the day before however this was not an option as you then had to cancel and order again which costs a fee it is what it is although i think its poor service the days go by and we are looking forward to leaving and then today i get an offer if you can travel from dkk i therefore go in and look when it sounds like the buckles and can see that the price is significantly cheaper for our cruise than what we paid here it must be added that we have ordered the de luxe package which is not exactly cheap i therefore call you and think that it is not exactly a rebooking but rather you who lower the price of a product i am again greeted by an explanation that states that it is just unfortunate i really think that it is false marketing to have different campaigns and when one comes along that is better than the one you had booked via that you do not correct the price i therefore definitely believe that this is false marketing and you should return the difference in the overpaid compared to the campaign you have now i hope you would engage in dialogue about this and see the problem in your way of marketing yourself
easy experience nice ferry will definitely use again
we had been looking forward to the trip got an extremely small cabin with a small double bed under square meter of floor space for suitcases shoes and two people fine catering on board but long waiting times in the bars the employees apologized but complained about understaffing pearl is worn in many places the icing on the cake was two parking fines in the windscreen we had ordered and paid for parking from home and a dfds employee indicated where we should park we drew attention to this on our return to copenhagen but were dismissed that it could not fit and that we had to report it to the parking company ourselves come on dfds
really easy to check in board etc the vessel was clean and modern and staff were polite and helpful
okay dfds its a mess with your ticket booking process on dfdscom similar to cheating you have to look for it very long and earnestly i neither can must nor will create an account on some other dfds site that is not dfdscom i will not enter any information on a site that is completely unknown to me whose affiliation i know nothing about to me it is very similar to cyberjacking where a wellknown website dfdscom has been hacked and now redirects customers to another site which could be anything moreover all your reservation information disappears and you have no idea where you have ended up and why the cave you have to create an account on whatwherewhy it is impossible to think of anything other than either cyberjacking or software errors and ones conclusion is therefore to find alternative forms of travel between copenhagen and oslo this is extremely unprofessional web design on the part of dfds i can sail with hurtigruten in norway for days all the way to svalbard without having to create an account well but im trying an alternative to dfds
we were allowed to leave early on the next boat without any problem which we really liked i dont feel like waiting for hours anymore so thank you
half hour late departure apparently due to fuelling took a good while after arrival to unload a number of hgvs befor cars departed i accept that both these occurrences are not normal in my experience on this service but did yesterday
fab time on the ship the crew were amazing a credit to dfds
the flexibility to swap destinations
we were impressed that we received timely information about the earlier departure via various channels the commodore cabin was pleasant the food in the north sea bistro was also good but we found the prices a bit excessive
due to storm remnants in the scheduled timing of the ferry departures and autoroute blockage on the a in fance it looked like becoming a miserable journey to the netherlands it resulted however in a pleasant crossing to calais earlier than planned instead of dunkirk crossing delayed to and on advice of te checkin assistant we took the touristic route from calais to dunkirk instead of the a which tresulted in a timely arrival in the neterlands one hour ahead of schedule the checkin assistant was the only one who informed us of the french traffic problems and no dfds information was given to us in dover nor any advice on arrival in france we are regular travellers on the dunkirk dover route since more than ten years and would suggest again that you reward regular travellers in a promoting way thanks for the advice given during our travel and looking forward to your reaction on our frequent traveller suggestion gjm schavemaker ingrid wilms
even though french farmers had blocked the roads to dunkirk aand i was later arriving the reception staff worked at top speed to ensure i could then pass though to customs etc i just made it by the skin of my teeth the dfds staff could have simply saidsorry too latebut they ddi not so top marks
the journey was pleasant and comfortable the staff who i interacted with were very friendly
good ship on time and not busy as we like it
ferry got in picked up lorries and left row of passengers cars behind after i was told in the check in i would be booked on next ferry i am a very frequent user of your ferry services and normally very satisfied with things like on board service punctuality and flexibility but as you specifically asked about the latest journey booking nr i wasnt when i finally got to my hometown i more or less had to go to work directly
i take the ferry to the uk times a year and always with dfds just good experiences including pricing techniques
we use your newhaven dieppe crossing several times a year and love it but felt let down when you cancelled ferry to newhaven on jan st as we were instructed to call you urgently but then found the number did not operate at weekends we spent hours attempting to find out our options and double the cost to get ourselves home in fuel and another service as we had deadlines to meet
difficult crossing due to bad weather plenty of announcements to keep is all safe
or return trip newcastle amsterdam was very enjoyable or cabin was clean and warm friendly staff and nice children playground we sailed during the storm isha the ferry departed his earlier because of the storm the time change was communicated to us very clearly using email text messages and phone call never seen such a big ferry jumping on the waves before and two of got pretty sick but it seems that the crew handled the ferry well we all survived and only arrived little bit late also the cars were without scratch which was a nice surprise after such a storm
oh please dont you rock my boat because i dont want my boat to be rocking
excellent pretrip comms about a storm and sailing time changes from the dutch office quick boarding and unloading helpful boat staff comfy bed the most basic cabin and ok soundproofing v good boat stabilizers helped the rough conditions
it is a pleasure to cross the chanel by dfds ferry
i didnt receive email on time from dfds and couldnt submit passenger info form it made me stress so far it worked without any problems
i would strongly advise anyone and all travelers from frederikshavn to travel with this company we were supposed to travel on the th get an email on the day that the boat has been cancelled this is the only way we are tried to be contacted so we only see this when we stop in frederikshavn we are forced due to our place of residence to spend the night in a hotel for a departure with another company the following day dfds rejects all compensation for an extra hours of driving and an overnight stay in a hotel the cancellation is due to the weather conditions in frederikshavn wind ms we then arrive with another company and at pm the day before the return journey ut calls dfds to hear about the return journey if any should also be cancelled they completely reject this the return journey is still relevant at ut receives an email that the boat has been canceled and the reason is due to the weather conditions ut contacts dmi and examines the weather conditions on the day of the return journey the wind is ms on the day of the return journey and as ut can understand from other complaints dfds can sail to copenhagen but frederikshavn is not an option when the wind is over ms s quotas it really does in denmark quot dfds will not offer any compensation apart from returning the tickets therefore i want to advise all travelers from frederikshavn to use this skod company they cannot sail to frederikshavn and they give zero and nothing back in compensation
i travel with dfds frequently and most of the time fine the crossings ok there are some things that i and many passengers find irritating though the seating and tables have seen better days and really need to be replaced the lounge chairs are not comfortable and only a few seem to have been recovered get some new ones that are comfortable and replace the badly scarred and worn tables the food i give a miss to its overly expensive and very average and boring so i bring my own as do many passengers i only use the cabin service if i cannot find a suitable daytime crossing cabins are not cleaned well in my opinion and the beds are uncomfortable i tried one of the commodore cabins for one crossing last year and never again the bed was super high and hard to get into or out of the bathroom was yuk and dirty and the cabin was so tired i wondered what on earth i was paying for the offloading experience is also extremely long winded and frustrating you can be stuck on the boat for an hour or more after docking because they cannot get enough cars and trucks off in the severely limited space on the docks more thought into how to solve that would be welcome as there is ground space but only lanes for cars in short invest more in making it more seamless and use of this service would increase i also think a loyalty scheme would be welcome for frequent travellers like myself i use this crossing because it suits me but i now find with inconvenient schedules and constant changing of them i am looking at alternatives more and more
easy boarding and departure on time going delay returning for some unknown reason unfortunate
ive travelled many times with dfds on various routes they are always great value for money check in is always a slick process and the staff are very polite and helpful what i dont like is boarding the ship with roaming data activated on my phone which is then automatically connected to a maritime service with horrendously high rates when i realised this only after a few minutes it had charged me i think there should be a warning about this before and after boarding and information included with the booking confirmation
everything ok amp a cheap quick trip to oslo but you have to calculate an amount for people of between dkk and dkk for food drinks amp parking in our case it was years since we were last on the ferry so even if everything worked as expected it was probably also the last trip in an inside cabin i felt quottrappedquot
un loading took a long time to get off the boat
the customer service was excellent i got a bit lost in amsterdam trying to find the port and the port staff phoned me to see if i was going to make it which was very reassuring fortunately i did just before check in closed many thanks
we had booked the ferry from frederikshavn to oslo in good time for sunday on saturday in the afternoon i receive an sms from dfds dfds frederikshavnoslo this departure is canceled due to weather conditions we will contact you tomorrow for the possibility of rebooking or cancellation there is absolutely nothing in the weather forecast that could indicate problems with the weather all other ferries sailed well enough we ended up booking another ferry with colorline which of course sailed when i book a ferry there are other bookings in the same connection in this case cabin and lift pass then there must be a really good reason for the cancellation the nice lady from dfds who called later suggested that we could drive to copenhagen and take the ferry from there there were others who did that so the ferry sailed just not within frederikshavn never more dfds incidentally the money from the booking has not been returned yet either
what was particularly noteworthy on the crown seaways was the quality of the food in the buffet restaurant it was really excellent we didnt like the fact that in the cabin you had the feeling of sleeping right next to the main engine ive never experienced anything like that on any other overnight ferry the bunks are also extremely narrow perhaps a newer ship is due
an average experience overall food selection was great cabin was tidy and clean but we ran in a couple of issues during the trip when we arrived to our cabin and opened it there was a drunk man sitting in it with all his belongings we ordered a whole separate cabin so with a year old on my hands and all the luggage we had to go downstairs to the reception cabin was changed but there was no apology no offers for an upgrade ferry was almost empty no nothing just a simple ok go to another cabin i guess it happens a lot and employees are just used to this boarding took ages as i mentioned before ferry was half empty but somehow we still waited more than an hour after checkin was already closed so dont bother comming early especially with children because youll be sitting in a car for a long long time without a possibility to use a wc
really helpful advice given after accidently booking the wrong leaving port really grateful
i took advantage of the winter offer and really enjoyed my trip across the ocean as it was at a reduced price this meant i was able to afford to enjoy one buffet experience and one breakfast i took some euros in cash to avoid too many card charges which went quickly as i also had to buy an adapter as it doesnt say whether sockets in the cabin are uk or eu so would be helpful to have known this in advance also it would be helpful to be able to buy something priced in the mid range as a savoury meal as the second night i had to have two snacks instead and nothing like a toastie available in the cafe just pastries so it would be good to have some savoury snacks available such as sausage rolls and sandwiches or soup and bread overall a good experience with the transfers too and would use this offer again lovely helpful assistance too on and off for the transfer parts as i needed a wheelchair something that did confuse me i thought id read that the ship left on uk time at pm from the uk so was a bit confused when it left in eu time i was hanging around waiting and asked staff at half past five who didnt seem to know but ill know for next time this meant i could have rested as planned in my cabin before going outside on deck so i was hanging around then having to go up and down stairs to ask staff who then didnt know so this was difficult with my disability i will only rely on guest services next time as a lot of the staff didnt understand my question which wasnt helpful the entertainment was good too and plenty of space on board maybe as perhaps the time of year and midweek not so busy would definitely do this trip again and now i know how it all works and what i need to bring etc i would now stay over in amsterdam next time as apparently the coach transfers are the same time every day
the customerfacing staff were great as usual food up to your normal standard and the crossing was efficiently navigated as usual at minutes for disembarcation the wait is now excessive however especially as there were so few vehicles on the car decks last night we make between and crossings on that route annually favouring a shorter crossing over shorter drive times but at mins thats hours in a car on the car deck
a super nice customer service representative maria corrected an incorrectly ordered ticket from copenhagen to oslo thank you very much such customer care is worth its weight in gold for dfds
reliable clean ships good service
we have travel with dfds for many years and they have never let us down we always pass our travels with friends agents and with general public
there was a hour delay as you have to arrive at least hour before my dogs had to wait in the car for more than hours as you dont allow them inside your building you need to provide a warm waiting area for animals as it was freezing also they must wait in the car during the crossing and it was minus degrees my dogs were very cold why does it cost per dog for them to be treated so badly you treat them like objects
super good experience on pearl seaways really good and professional service from the staff huge praise to them because the staff cover to a large extent most of the experience of the trip a huge recommendation from here
tuesday th january i attempted to return hrs earlier than my booking on the sunday th january due to the severe fluvial rainfall both in france and belgium since i caught the dover to calais crossing on the thursday am as i was receiving text alert on my phone re warnings about potential flooding of my home in bridgwater this wasnt accepted by your dfds ferry terminal staff calais to return on a earlier ferry without saying i had to pay to change my booking as i explained my credit cards and euros were depleted and i had no way of paying this surcharge as was monies i did have i needed for diesel also having spent the time in the city of bruge whilst on my short trip i had to then sleep in my vehicle yrs of age with heart issues and also severe spine problems which cause cramping in the legs when to much pressure on the spine on what was one of the coldest nights wettest nights until i could go back to the terminal in the morning sunday to catch the next ferry so after travelling with po dfds for the last yrs regularly across to calais or dunkirk in the wine business and visiting regularly my late father who lived in trier germany since the early s until his death in aged so not impressed after paying to cross return i had hoped to fly over to spain during this weekend gone from bristol airport where i work as passenger security agent but no flights available returning to uk on the days i was requiring to get away and enjoy a break after working my birthday yrs and christmas eve also new years early eve day until mid day even with the email discount you had sent me a discount invitation to travel dover to calais route i used it as no other options available for me as i had to be back to work am monday th lulagate airport bristol thought i would share this experience as to why i rated my trip so unfavourably but did appreciate the newness of the departure sailing ship ferry a nice surprise from the worn ferries of past years crossings sailings yours sincerely david has possibly deterred me from using dfds a future date im sorry to say as i have in the past enjoyed the crossings to recharge my tiredness before driving the other side of the channel i was used to driving through brussels down to luxomberg to wasserbillig onto trier where my father used to live ps im sure the previous sailings was not over booked or sold out just a way of extracting extra revenue
comfortable journey and lovely staff would be a great improvement if there were dog exercise areas both in north shields and ijmuiden port areas having to present a boarding card every time anything is purchased is irritating
you now have to pay dkk extra per way which goes to the eu against quotclimate changequot ridiculous and far too high an amount if they absolutely have to quotstealquot as it is in my eyes nothing gets greener if we become poorer stop yourselves the ferry sails regardless
very pleasant helpful staff great communication cabins are very clean been sailing on ferries for many years now dfds po stena lines gnv crimaldi lines and virtu ferries out of all of those i find dfds the best company to sail with the most comfortable cleanest and most helpful company of all of them
the ship was beautiful well equipped we got to board and earlier journey too
ferry left calais hour minutes late last night
we use dfds from duinkerk to dover we have done the trip times this year if you arrive early and there is room you can drive on to the ferry waiting and thats great if you are late and you watch your ferry leave its not so good so arrive on time to avoid dissapointment duinkerk is a basic port and you can use the bathroom while you wait but thats about it so take provisions if you want to eat or drink we find the service depends on the crew i guess thats the same anywhere but the premium lounge was in a bad way on this outward journey and the cleaning product that had been put on the carpet had a truly horrible smell and left my sinus swolen it was uncomfortable for days this is the reason for just stars on the return journey on the th jan the premium lounge was run by a great lady who left us wishing for nothing
i was close to giving you but the fact that the from calais to dover and was assured by dfds port entry checking as bbeing on time did nto arrive until and finally left at and hour late however it got a lot better on board when i got to the executive lounge where the young serving man was excellent the food was better and sufficient and the general experience apart form children running around was quite excellent on top of that the ticket was much cheaper than po and the lounge significantly better well done i will use you again and again
the treatment dfds gave its customers when we were stranded in resund first in the new year due to the serious winter weather was sublimein the situation itself dfds ensured that we could all keep our spirits high
the ferry had been changed and we got a cabin without window while we booked the one with a window parkong in the car deck in the ferry was a terrible experience with no staff available for guidance at first min and trying to figure it out ourselves together with other passengers and then a very angry guy appeared and tried to regulate the chaos it was obvious he was not a driving himself as was giving confusing signs while parking the lock of the door of the cabin was broken so we could not lock it and it felt not safe with drunk passengers sorting out their conflicts just outside our cabin door and no security staff came to calm then down the floor of the cabin was dirty so really band experience this time
border controll a little slowloading very efficienti even arrived at dunkirk by mistakeshot off to calaisenice crew very helpfullnice shipi didnt find a spce to liedown to sleep but slept in chairokthe ship should state there will be a fine uf you start engine before doors are openas other drivers were ignoring the shios requestits so inconsiderate of the drivers
dfds like all other ferry companies embarking from the port of dover should do a bit more work with the port authorities and french border control to improve the boarding experience overall communications on all channels should also improve on december nd we had a ferry booked for and the official page of dfds said do not show up more than hours in advance unfortunately there were so many people travelling that day that we started queuing at am and ended up missing consecutive ferries ending up on the one for a total of hours waiting in a car barely moving with no facilities nearby not a toilet not a cafe we appreciate the issue was with the port authorities and french border control but this is not acceptable you need to improve both communications and boarding
i was on a new years cruise with dfds rarely have i experienced such fantastic service everyone from crew to staff did everything they could to make us have a great trip the food both buffets and a la carte new years eve was absolutely fantastic crew were ready with red roses for us when we got back on board in oslo there was an absolutely fantastic cornucopia the staff made sure that wreath cake and champagne were ready well in time for midnight and bartenders were super quick to serve drinks everything just played both days i can really recommend such a trip
it was the best boat and my famoly and i were crying when we left dfds our baby
we arrived early for our crossing and was put on an earlier crossing with no extra cost
really useful to be given the option to travel on an earlier ferry if we arrive early
staff and crew were friendly and efficient ship ran on time and the whole experience was easy and straightforward
the reasons i use dfds ferries after having used other operators for years is because i find dfds very helpful if you have a complicated trip i will give here a recent incident where i arrived one day late for my departure on a return from belgium to england and on my arrival at the port i was told that my reservation was for a day earlier one phone call later by the booking person and with no fuss i was allowed to embark and travel home another instance i arrived earlier than my booked time and was ask if i wanted to take an earlier booking as there was a ferry ready to go i said yes and was allowed to get on the other side to france earlier and travel to my destination earlier food on the ship is very good and clean also the ships are always clean and the crews always welcoming the travellers on board without forgetting the duty free shop with a good selection of goods at bargain price yes i like and recommend dfds to any one
queueing is appalling at dieppe queues were back on the main road roundabout i joined one of these lines and the vehicle in front was being told to reverse by a port worker so i was told to form a new line i did so expecting them to open one of the other booths they did not i had a trailer on and it would have been very difficult to reverse all the way back fortunately someone did allow me in but the customs guy who saw this couldnt understand why i drove to an unattended booth i explained that i was directed there by a worker he then ensured i was literally the last vehicle to board taking vehicles from my line in front and behind of me small minded spiteful little toe rag

good price flexible to travel on earlier crossing pleasant staff
i have used dfds close to times and understand the typical service for the ferry crossing the crossing on tuesday night didnt feel safe the weather was so rough and the dover boat was cancelled i had trusted that the crossing would be slightly rough but this was exceptional and there should not have been doing the crossing that evening i was genuinely afraid throughout the crossing and will reconsider travelling again in the winter months with dfds my confidence in the company has lowered
very rough crossing to newhaven but skills of captain and crew did much to lessen the effect of the bad weather for the passengers
staff are always friendly and thats quite a feat when the weather is rough also i had to change my ticket and that was in the dieppe terminal quick and painless the main problem is due to brexit loading and unloading the french side was always super efficient for cars disembarking due to the french police taking passports from down the line and doing a batch at a time which they still do but cant as quickly as before due to the stamps required this means theres now a tailback right from the booths back to the ferry and on my last exit from dieppe because the incoming ferry was held up probably the weather cars waiting to embark for the next sailing had to wait until this queue went this held up the next sailing i suspect even if they do have to do some cleaning in between in the next couple of years there are more checks due to be implemented so im hoping the ferry companies can liaise with the french government to try and find ways to simplify what is an ever more difficult process not their fault apologies of course to the companies from all travellers who definitely did not vote leave i see an earlier review has said they werent allowed to take their own food so it was very expensive thats an error you certainly can still as far as ive experienced its just you cant take animal products or fresh veg into the eu brexit again
great service competitive pricing clean boat pleasant crew what more could you ask for
moved to an earlier crossing at checkin without additional payment it is why i continue to return to dfds
huge praise and an equally big thank you my family and i were on board the ferry which unfortunately had to postpone its landing due to stormy weather here on january this probably benefited very few passengers but i just have to lie flat on top of the eminent service that was subsequently provided the staff worked like crazy to make everything go smoothly and although tired faces could be seen at the end the service was still done with smiles and high high quality huge pat on the back from here
have repeatedly written to customer service about our poor cabin on board the crossing november but have despite four emails still not received a reply maybe ill be lucky to get an answer through here
we came early and had no problem had earlier ferryvery appreciated after hours driving
we arrived at dover very late in the evening having experienced huge traffic delays due to the channel tunnel being closed french strike action as a consequence we missed our scheduled departure to calais nevertheless dfds were incredibly flexible they found us a place on the next ferry also offering us an alternative route via dunkirk the dfds team were brilliant there were a lot of stressed passengers around and they handled the situation calmly with a great degree of understanding thank you
we have just been on a new years trip from copenhagen on new years eve was not what we had expected was seated at a table in the corner down the back we were forgotten several times had to ask for wine and my husband for beer only got one for the courses no never came even though we moved they ran out of port so the tables in the corner didnt get port and baiiys there wasnt any more either the coffee never came even though we had been given cups so all in all we dont think we got what we paid for we have been on several trips with til oslo and with great pleasure but it didnt work until such a large company was under control someone with the big overview was missing so all tables got what we were promised never again on new years eve on the oslo boat
the ferry cost was reasonable and the staff i dealt with were very friendly and thats very important the boats were also clean only downside the breakfast i spent for my wife and children was absolutely disgusting
great company i have sailed many times now and will continue to do so
information for waiting passengers after delay i think it was very bad standing in row some information from staff who were not there would have provided clarity so that we knew something
great service at the dieppe port and onboard however the disembarking took way too long in newhaven we were left waiting for over minutes when we returned to the car as the ferry was already an hour late coming into the port due to the weather conditions it would have been nice to have a swifter disembarking and to be kept informed
once you are on the ferry the holiday feeling starts all staff were friendly as they have been in the past too
we wanted to travel from oslo to frederikshavn on january nd the stop was cancelled but the trip to copenhagen went as planned we also have the impression that dfds is cutting it short because only a handful of cars and trucks go out there and its not worth it we were able to rebook for january rd but that was cancelled too we booked stena line straight away and they went the crossing was calm little wind why can stena line do that dfds refused to reimburse additional costs on the phone because of the weather this has happened to us twice in december alone stops were cancelled conclusion we will not book there again
it is super nice to be on the boat to oslo and back again however they only get stars as most things on the boat are a bit expensive and the boats are quite worn out
due to getting covid i tried to change my return crossing on saturday i could not change it as the call centre was closed i ended up booking the eurotunnel one day later
great company great service shame about the two hour wait in dover due to french paff
excellent service the ship is clean and well equipped
pleasant staff reasonable fare newhavendieppe is a useful route for us saving on driving tolls and fuel in france ferry needs a bit of renovation however and theres a lot of unnecessary waiting around before boarding
for the first time having always used the newhaven ferry we were fortunate to be one of the first cars off the ship the last time we were nd to last off then obviously a huge queue at passport control it took ove and hours after we arrived
i wanted to travel from frederikshavn to oslo today my trip was cancelled because of the weather the ferry from copenhagen to oslo leaves on time though i dont understand is the stop in frederikshavn cancelled because only a few people like me want to get on there what about the transport order by the way im currently on the stenaline to gothenburg
love sailing with dfds always polite staff quick loading and embarking
ferry is finetheir web site is absolute stdoesnt work at all within apple osonly works in windows within chromeand then only just unless you log in first into an account for which password rules change without letting the customer know half hour to sort then booking a ticket is impossible upshot is i wasted a couple of hours of my life booking a ticket wouldnt have bothered continuing if they werent so cheap
smooth boarding and departure only issues was the vip lounge code hadnt been updated again
i would like to thank the entire team of the regina seaways ferry for the excellent service and warm welcome and in particular roman kadyev and lina galinyte these are very kind and helpful people i wish them success in their careers and personal lives happy new year everyone and see you again kjeldsvetlanavasja
dfds is saying a big f you to all passengers that dont own a vehicule even in a crisis situation where thousands of passengers are stuck because of eurostar dfds did nothing to accommodate foot passengers and sent them on their way threatening to call the police if hitchhiking to find a car to board the ferry there are a thousands way to get passenger on foot safely on board but dfds is just choosing not to because its inconvenient to them
we are going to travel from oslo to frederikshavn d just got a call from dfds who said the boat has been canceled and asked if we could come to copenhagen instead its the same boat after all but we couldnt do this as it was full there is no one standing in frederikshavn i do have a seat in frederikshavn which was just about to be extended to copenhagen the system for frederikshavn and the system for copenhagen cannot talk to each other this is not easy as both systems are from dfds
punctual departure competent and friendly staff our return journey was redirected to calais which was very helpful thank you
first time using a ferry service due to uncertainty with other modes of transport and strikes and i was really happy with the experience everything was smooth sailing from boarding departure and exciting the ship in both directions i cant fault anything really
we loved that we could be outside on the ship and that smoking was allowed the premium lounge and dutyfree shop are also great places to pass the time everything went smoothly from booking to leaving the ferry wed love to go again thank you very much
everything is fine the forward trip was great because we sailed with aura back with regina this ferry needs an upgrade
we bought in advance for seas with a drink this drink was then a beer or water as it could not cost more than nok this information was missing a lot and we felt cheated
poorly equipped shop with limited supply restaurants were mostly closed the only open one served only english breakfast poorly maintained windows along the front of the ferry decent experience overall but nothing to write home about
we travelled on december we arrived earlier and exchanged our ticket for the earlier time without any problems the staff on the ferry boat were very friendly super
great service and nice employees we were three cars that had to reach the ferry from oslo we bump into a queue and a large amount of snow and can see that we wont reach the ferry until pm dfds calls us in the cars and jokes how far we are we say that we can only be at the ferry on dfds tells us that they will wait for us so that we can come with the ferry when we arrive at the ferry well pressed and stressed there are some really nice gentlemen who tell us that now we just need to relax and guide us into our seats on the ferry so big thanks to dfds for waiting for us and really good service from top to bottom you made a huge difference thank you
made a trip to ijmuidennewcastle for the second time and always a nice experience its just a pity that the person cabin was on the nd floor and was very noisy due to the stormy waves the cabin was quite small for people and the mattresses need to be replaced because they are quite hard all praise for the staff on board always friendly and helpful on the way back the toilet in the hut was clogged causing it to be full of water and after reporting the problem they immediately came to solve it we are already looking forward to the next trip with dfds
december dover port and dfds working well extra lines for french customs and dfds check in a rough crossing but easily cooped with by ships staff excellent breakfast
i encountered a challenging experience with the service provider upon arriving at the port at pm for a scheduled pm trip i was advised to arrive minutes prior regrettably a single staff member at the uk border force resulted in substantial delays causing me to miss the ferry this setback affected not only me but also a significant number of other vehicles totaling cars stranded until with no alternative accommodations the cabins were found to be unsatisfactorily maintained and encounters with the staff were less than courteous despite the desire to economize and not take the euroshuttle the decision resulted in a regrettable waste of four hours i recommend reconsidering the use of this service emphasizing the issues encountered during my journey
we were able to board an earlier ferry for the return home which was an unexpected bonus despite strong winds the crossing was remarkably smooth
a good crossing as always with dfds but spoiled somehat by the sheepherding experience and long security queues when disembarking at ijmuiden
the ferry was delayed which was unsurprising because of the weather conditions however there was very little on the website i would have had to sign onto twitter i think to get up to date information i do not want to sign up for x twitter just to get travel updates it would be helpful to have something on the website or the dfds app
delayed arriving by hrs into amsterdam than took over an hour to disembark the boat
i am generally fond of dfds and use them when i can they pay their staff at least minimum wage unlike the other operators and their staff are a little more professional and it feel safer less chaotic on board however bit of a gripe on this trip minute delay in boarding at dunkerque with a year old on the back seat the weather conditions caused the serious delay so cant argue too much about that however they would have known this was likely a long time before it happened the weather panned out exactly as forecast however they have no mechanism to inform travellers they can check in late so they can go off and do something else rather than sit in the car park waiting without even a functional caf there isnt even an information board to tell you once youre there what is happeningwhen you can expect to board
very efficient comfortable ship good foodalways use dfds
very bad because from calais to dover i arrived in hours no mention of bad but this is the truth a company below points
boat is very modern and has good facilities food price was highly priced as per normal on these ferries the journey did take minutes extra due to gale force winds but not anyones fault lucky it did not get cancelled would use again
fantastic good christmas buffet and lovely room next time we come again dfds ferry
the booking was easy it was unfortunate that it was so busy on december that our ferry to dunkirk was delayed but these things happen we thought it a nice gesture that they announced a free hot or cold drink to all passengers who had missed this ferry my family if three and several others then went to the bar to get a drink most had waited or hours to get through customs what angered us all was at the till we were told the cola or fizzy drinks we chose had to be paid for the water and tea were free several people agreed that the announcement said hot or cold not water or tea kids dont want tea or water and the adults needed some sugar energy to continue on their delayed journey very disappointed
the staff is really kind and helpful it was a very nice ship to stay
crossing from uk to dunkirk was fast with friendly staff return crossing was a little disappointing as the rest lounge was as dirty and a little noisy with doors banging notwithstanding the above i would use them again
staff were very helpful dunkirk ferry was delayed so they gave my inlaws the option of going on the calais ferry inlaws cant speak english so the port workers were happy to speak to me over their phone service
we stayed overnight at the travel lodge in dover and arrived at the port at am the barriers were still down but we were third in the queue when the barriers opened we were directed to a lane behind the vans in front they then opened other barriers and directed the cars to other lanes the first van went through but the nd one had a problem with their passports we were stuck there for minutes whilst all the cars behind us were redirected to other lanes and eventually the van was taken to one side they then decided to change over the people in the box which took another mins we were then pulled in for a quick security check on finally reaching the dfds box we were told they were now loading the lorries onto our ferry and we would have to wait for the am hours hanging around the port with a month baby was not funny our ferry then left at am minutes early it was a very bad start and we spent all day playing catch up arriving at our destination minutes late the girl in the dfds box was very rude and unapologetic we asked if she could contact the ferry so we could be loaded with the lorries we had done this before but she refused and closed the window
was allowed to catch an earlier ferry to avoid delays due to the stormy weather
you have changed departure time of my ferry this resulted of myself leaving work early on sunday the reason i choose to travel night time is to give myself plenty time to get ready
besides french customs last check in was okay but when we stood in our lane we saw that several lanes were cars arrived later were boarding prior our lane this gives us a bad feeling
all in all a good experience the only downside is that the ferry was almost an hour late which meant that you got to bed quite late
all good just a bit slow to get off the boat
very efficient embarkation after spending a quiet short overnight on the quay breakfast on board was ok facilities on the ship showing considerable aging and in need of update no usb charging only pin european sockets disembarking was quick but then slow on dockside for checking of vehicle contents
first the positive we were driven safely to newcastle and back to ijmuiden the buffet had a lot of choice and was good the cabin was clean the mattress was very soft however we booked a mini cruise on the day of departure i received a call saying that we would arrive in newcastle at am instead of am because of the weather conditions so far so good when we arrived at the terminal we were told that we would arrive at around am but the transfer would not be available we did not understand that but then we would take a taxi on the day of arrival after am we received an announcement that we would arrive at around pm so the trip to newcastle would be impossible for us criticism of the shipping company the inadequate communication as a landlubber i cannot estimate how much of a delay the wind will cause if the forecast is not accurate to within an hour ok but am is still a lot especially if you are aiming for a short trip to newcastle
one problem is that we cannot get in touch with you when you cancel departures not on the phone which is closed at weekends and then you also close the chat its not ok however you managed to make the sailing from denmark to oslo through the storm pia go very smoothly we would love to sail with you through a storm another time
the long wait in my vehicle on a cold damp night to board your vessel also your vessel was not very warm inside
unfortunately because of the storm the outward journey was a nauseating trip for my first experience fortunately the return journey made up for it and we were still able to enjoy the boat everything on board costs money it would be nice if they made this an inclusive price so that you dont have to worry about it a trip to new castle itself was highly recommended a nice shopping center
it was a great experience to spend christmas on the ferry really nice and nice and smiling staff nothing was missing will definitely take a trip like this with my wife again one christmas
we had a bit of a slower crossing than usual by about hours but crew did not show any of the pressure they were surely under remained friendly and professional at all times
love the services and the crew they are friendly and efficient from check in clearance shop and dinner deck crew was informative it was our first time sailing with dfds however pet friendly cabin is too small for people and dogs there was limited space for us to maneuver the pet area is a bit small for a proper walk the deck has a strong smell of urine the cinema was a good facility however the price was more than uk market price the interior is also a bit old although sufficient for a ferry
had a super fun trip the staff met us upon arrival and pointed us in the right direction in addition they are very friendly however we could not exchange our money as indicated on the website and it was not always possible to order everything that was on the cards but this small point should certainly not spoil our fun thank you for this beautiful experience
super efficient crew on land and on the ferry we were crossing on the busiest day of the year and the staff were amazing
as always polite and helpful staff at checkin and aboard your ship
we had a very rough crossing from dieppe on the nd december a lot of passengers were ill including my children the head steward went out of her way to help us and find somewhere for my son to lie down without her help the trip would have been u bearable a credit to dfds
it was super busy but we enjoyed the crossing
a nightmare at the port of dover we arrived hours before the departure as asked and it took us hours to pass the customs we had to take a boat hours later than expected and couldnt take to way back as it was to short in total h from dover to calais otherwise the staff on the boat is very friendly and the boat was clean
booked on and ended leaving on pm
last minute booking as tunnel was on strike very good experience easy to book friendly and helpful staff clean ferry
avoid bad experience take a half day to waiting to get in the ferry booked am arrived am but time to get in ferry am no point to booked slots
we had the pleasure of going on a ferry tour with dfds and it was an absolute delight from start to finish the experience was nothing short of fantastic for both adults and children alike first and foremost the staff on the ferry were kind and helpful they went above and beyond to ensure that all passengers felt welcome and comfortable one of the highlights of this ferry tour was the cleanliness of the cabins it was evident that the crew took great pride in maintaining a hygienic and sanitary environment this attention to detail gave us peace of mind especially during these times and allowed us to fully relax and enjoy the trip the ferry departed on time which allowed us to make the most of our day and enjoy every moment of the journey the professionalism and organization of the crew ensured a smooth and seamless experience throughout as a family with kids we were thrilled to find that the ferry tour was incredibly kidfriendly there were numerous activities and entertainment options tailored specifically for children from onboard games and puzzles to dedicated play areas our kids were never short of things to do the enthusiastic staff made sure the little ones were engaged and entertained creating an enjoyable experience for everyone one of the best aspects of this ferry tour was the lack of downtime with so many activities and amenities available onboard there was never a dull moment whether it was exploring the ferrys various decks taking in the scenic views or indulging in delicious snacks and refreshments there was always something to keep us occupied and entertained this ferry tour provided a unique opportunity for our family to bond and spend quality time together we made unforgettable memories while sailing through picturesque waters admiring stunning landscapes and enjoying the company of fellow passengers it was a truly enriching experience that allowed us to appreciate the beauty of our surroundings and create lasting family connections in conclusion i highly recommend this ferry tour for families seeking a memorable and enjoyable adventure the friendly staff clean cabins punctuality and array of kidfriendly activities make it an ideal choice dont miss out on the chance to embark on this remarkable journey with your loved ones its an experience that will leave you with cherished memories rating
horrible customer service absolutely incredible departure was not canceled dangerous weather was reported dfds is the only company that doesnt care in fact customer service judges themselves on the phone and says so
we received good service both in terms of information when the boat was changed due to the weather and on board
we arrived early so were able to get an earlier ferry without any problems although weather was bad crossing was not too choppy merry christmas
smooth and punctual process attentive staff regarding rebooking to an earlier ferry condition of the sanitary facilities is borderline and should be renovated and cleaned regularly
thank you so much for enabling us to return to uk after the closure of eurotunnel services very grateful to you and the excellent crew on board
everything was satisfactory but there was one point that was annoying the notices before departure about the need to provide passenger data even though all of this had already been sent why arent just the affected passengers addressed
very poor customer service no way to contact them after hours to change booking our trip changed very last minute we had a booking for the pm ferry out of newhaven despite the fact they have crossings at night none of the phone numbers work and just give an out of office message
ive been sailing dfds from dunkirk to rosslare once a week for a year the worst line they pack two drivers into the cabin the last time i stood in the cabin on the carpet there was water all around the smell was incredible hours a day it was an optima i warn you before boarding
the ferry was exceptionally clean and tidy the crossing was smooth and trouble free however my wife and i had booked the relax lounge which was fine but the toilet just outside was locked and thus not available for use meaning that we both had to walk through the ship to find alternatives
the actual trip yesterday was fine in the end but not happy about receiving an email the morning before the day trip to say the return ferry had been changed to an earlier one which would have given us just one hour in france fortunately i had the time to phone and arrange for it to be changed again to a later ferry if i hadnt have been able to change it i would have been asking for a refund for non delivery of service
everything went perfekt from the booking till the arrival after our trip all the crew are so friendly and helpful we had a great stay on the ship and in newcastle
only one problem namely total lack of transport from terminal to town in dieppe this will prevent us in our midlate s from travelling this route again despite such good staff
after booking calais instead of dunkirk by accident they changed my booking at the dunkirk gate without any fuss the staff were very friendly too
all was great rough seas but service continued well
as usual sailed on time tand to schedule allowed us to board an earlier crossing than booked as we arrived earlier than planned food good and staff friendly as ever full of christmas joy
all in all there is a super service on board however we had booked a bus round trip in oslo but that bus had left minutes before the boat docked and we got ashore its not ok even though its not dfdss fault that the bus couldnt wait for us thats why we encourage dfds to find another round trip operator instead therefore only stars
january booking no then it happened again for the rd time in a row we have booked together with others cabins we were again given a cabin at the back at the exit and stairs to the viewing deck i was mega disappointed once again and this time went downstairs to complain the lady said it didnt help to get upset no but it also doesnt help to ask nicely if we could get a cabin on the opposite side we can only get in one side but at least we got another cabin slave with trouble always for the last years we have traveled with dfds on a minicruise about times a year because we are excited about the beautiful sailing from oslo always on commodore the last times in a balcony cabin the first time in the balcony was a change because we were not satisfied with the cabin we had been given the next times we got nice cabin but we really wanted the view from the other side when booking the trip in september i asked that we could get a cabin on the other side we got the one called that is the same side as we usually do but at the back of the ship where the lifeboats are suspended and where there is access to the observation deck so there was a creak bang and thud of metal against metal every time there was a gust of wind or someone went up or down the stairs i slept very badly and it was a huge disappointment but we still booked a trip again from december i asked nicely that we didnt get that cabin again and that we would like one on the other side we actually got that on the opposite side next to the rescue equipment and the traffic up and down the stairs again huge disappointment and it must be said that each time it is at a price of approx dkk and the bad cabins are not cheaper than the good ones without noise to fill the cup the cabin was freezing cold we couldnt regulate the temperature we had ordered the christmas buffet it was mediocre at best there was a long queue to be shown to the table and it took a long time before a waiter came and took drinks orders never before in my life have i had a fish fillet that was so tough that i couldnt stick a fork in it all in all a miserable and unreasonably expensive experience we will never travel that way again unfortunately we have booked a trip in january together with some family shame about spending my money on such a bad product and ignorant company
the trip was good and the staff was friendly the cabin was clean but the internet i payed for wasnt working properly
it is very annoying and very frustrating if the arrival time is pm and we got off the ferry at pm check out of the cabin at pm we had to wait hours before getting off the ferry they dont apologize for the inconvenience they dont offer coffee they didnt name the reasons why we have to wait so long if the arrival time is scheduled for it does not correspond to reality we went ashore at when we swam in the summer there were also problems we were disappointed for the second time in a row
the check in and boarding process was very quick and efficient crew all friendly and helpful it would however be nice to have a quiet area away from screaming children there used to be a room with airline type reclining seats which was a great place to get a sleep during the crossing
dfds did a good job in sailing us from ijmuiden to newcastle boat left in time staff was friendly beds were freshly made and we were even upgraded to a room with a view lovely gesture
dfds kept me informed of the potential problems a head a trip eg strike in calais they offered an alternative way to me eg travel trough dunkirk on the way back i missed my boat and i was out on the next one
great boat great service great time
firstly the price half the price of an equivalent sailing with its major competitor good sized cabins even an inside no sea view cabin good value food in the restaurant departure and arrival on time helpful friendly staff i will be sailing again
everything was so smooth checkin boarding and was a very pleasant crossing both ways the staff were welcoming and i even managed to sleep both ways
clean and tidy ferry friendly staff and on time
our ferry from dunkirk was cancelled on short notice but sailing from calais was good on new ferry
upgraded to a commodore deluxe cabin which was very nice but very disappointed that the huge tv only had danish or polish tv programmes for the cabin price a movie channel would not have been too much to expect between netherlands and the uk totally pointless brittany ferries have online free movies in all cabins would not upgrade next time if i used your ferries
arrived early and was offered an earlier sailing
needed to alter ferry to earlier time and no problem and no extra cost easy dunkirk sailing with no delay and good service on board free wifi on board is quite a bonus
your company is doing well but not great good ship good choices between dunkirk and calais especially for day trippers like ourselves my friends and i travel regularly for day trips on p o or dfds your boats are better than p o and the staff and the duty free offer but i made a mistake with the booking and entered the instead of the th i realised immediately but it still cost me so our crossing cost instead of is too much for a fully elecronic booking and i hope to be reimbursed or credited with the
out of toilet facilities were closed during the crossing this happens very frequently which is an inconvenience especially when there are many coaches and rough seas
outbound super helpful agent made the whole experience lovely although we sailed with a different carrier because we were early out we sailed back dfds which was a much nicer ship and better food choices
many different offers on the boat and high level of service
easy access and egress from the ferry great use of anpr good stability across the channel friendly and helpful staff although we used the relaxing lounge found it difficult to sleep due to the brightness in the room overall a great experience
always a great trip easy straightforward people helpful i use it a lot for back and forth usually good prices too except school times but then all prices go up then food good cant go wrong much better than some other ferries a
efficient service as usual despite slight departure delay due to medical emergency on outward trip and bad weather on return trip which did not affect schedule
i travel this route frequently and the crossing is always a good experience the vessel is always clean warm and comfortable to travel on and the staff are alway very friendly and helpful
very impressed by the design and cleanliness of all public areas on the ship including the toilets friendly helpful staff also made our crossing a very enjoyable experience excellent choice in duty free and surprisingly low prices
staff were brilliant ship was very clean and i changed my sailing time to two hours earlier with no fuss or bother duty free was a good selection even though unfortunately i did not have time to check the great beer wine and spirits selection at calais duty free overall as usual a great experience i am more than happy to pay a little more for a dfds crossing than the past experiences i have had with po ferries in the past
only two check in open at dover did not move for over minutes then told check in closed minutes ago then put on dunkirk crossing not told much longer crossing and even though i said we were heading to calais he never mentioned that it would be quicker to wait for the next calais ship on return duty free at terminal toilets ooo on ground floor and all cubicles on first gloor locked off do could not visit toilet not a great day and will have to think twice about using dfds again
great trip as usual guest services took one look at us and said their upgrades to commodore were full but i dont believe that as the next person upgraded no problems
the ferry was clean and on time there was an announcement concerning the stabiliser being raised shortly before arriving into newhaven harbour it said we should remain seated as it would cause serious rolling there was no announcement to say it had been completed
travelled dover dunkirk and vv on dec for xmas shopping trip staff on board and at both ports very helpful everything on time good value winter daytrip fare duty free shops wellstocked with great prices
nice trip but the times on board and on the mainland in england were confusing so we waited a long time at the bus stop everything else went well and good food and entertainment
we find dfds a very reliable and competitively priced company efficient and with friendly and helpful staff when we had a delay in getting to our booked crossing yesterday from dunkirk we were immediately accommodated on the next ferry to dover it was greatly appreciated
great experience nice new clean ship and plenty of space for the car polite and professional crew great experience will be booking again soon thank you
a horrible experience that ruined the start of a trip to bruges advised to arrive a hour early which we did to the port spent minutes in the only line open for cars at passport control out of the lanes possible with open for trucks then we have to spend another minutes in the only dfds line open for cars and buses during which time they only manages to process car and bus lanes were open for trucks the attendant was absolutely apathetic and so in the end we we are now having to sit here and watch out boat leave and wait another hours for the next all becuse of company penny penny pinching and lack of staff or lack of management doing what they are paid to do and make sure the staff rota is done correctly this was all on a saturday one of the busiest days of the week for weekend travelers
would have been a star rating other than being delayed leaving calais
we visited the duty free shop at dunkirk thomas was very helpful to us patient at the till as we wanted to collect a few more items got a trolley for us as we purchased more than we thought we would his command of english was excellent he was friendly and so helpful thank you thomas he is a credit to your company
seamless checkin super value for money and low carbon way of it intercountry travel smooth sail with pockets of community spaces highly recommended
nice calm crossing only complaint was how long it took to disembark
total rip off for filthy cabins booked in october for christmas charging over for oner person and one car for new castle amsterdam return now the same route sells for about but cant change the booking with a refund for the difference or even cancel same trip cost end of november doesnt say anywhere when booking if thats their stupid flexi or refundable tarrif its profeteering with being the only ferry between scotland and dover going to mainland nothing else there is no justification for for two nights in the first place at least wash your disgusting towels next time before putting them out there was something on them that looked like dried blood before the wash last time i had to be in one of your cabins
quick checkin punctual departure clean onboard facilities
a super trip again and staff in your dunkirk office are outstanding and so helpful we only travel with dfds as enjoy every minute off the crossing
i now always use dfds reliable i used to use eurotunnel as a frequent traveller but they are far more expensive since that option has gone the bit of flexibility is very important as it takes the worry out of arriving late and bonus of arriving earlier
staff members were really helpful on both our outward and return trips our outbound crossing was delayed due to a medical emergency but we were kept informed we had to amend our booking on the return trip and this was easy to do only slight negative was that is was quite cold in the lounges
i came to early for my booked travel but at the check in i got offered to swap over to the calais ferry perfect that did safe me some time on my journey to germany anyway the premium lounge at this ship was nicer and worth to book in as i am used on the dunkerke ferry
we have been using dsdf services for years we sail twice a year to kyli and back to klaipda but it has never been as bad as yesterday when sailing from kyli to klaipda we had booked a commondore de luxe cabin the regina seaways cabin was cold and the car was loaded to the tractor trailers we could not leave until the entire ferry was unloaded we left the ferry only at and we were the last passengers all plans were ruined because the passenger cars were unloaded at and we had to wait the ship was being cleaned and all the bars were closed we didnt want a chance to have a drink or a bite to eat now our plans include a trip to kyli and back on february march but we cant even order tickets because according to the schedules the ferries dont sail on such days and somehow the price has become very expensive from to thats with such quality of service we dont understand what to pay such money for if you want a better attitude towards passengers
good service on board ships etaetd as planned fast rollonrolloff process liked book library on board
our trip to dunkirk and back went very well and was on time boats were generally clean and tidy and staff very friendly and helpful
i was taken ill and had to get back i lost the hotel and the the money for that then to add insult to injury you charged me forty odd pounds to travel back which id already paid no comparison nothing not even a sorry to hear that from anyone very disappointed
cabin maintenance required before a customer is allocated the cabin i do hope the have managed to seal the drain in the shower of the cabin i was in postage note stuck to the bathroom wall and the water drain lid removed not good
i have been using the newhaven dieppe for about six years now two or three times a year before this i used dover for twenty years i found that the extra mileage traveling was tiring its much better from dieppe an hour and im in rouen at my friends house and not tired
we travel by car between norway and denmark times per year year we usually take dfds from copenhagen and its always a nice trip and much more pleasant than driving however the prices have completely dropped and the price difference between taking the ferry and driving is now so great that it is difficult to defend the ferry any longer i just ordered a oneway ticket from oslo to copenhagen and in addition to the already expensive price there will be an quotenvironmental feequot of dkk and an online booking fee of dkk and as the icing on the cake the cabin price was just raised by dkk when i went to pay on the grounds that there was quotlimited capacityquot it is dkk in fees on top of the ticket price for adults child in a commodore cabin with a car and some food on board the bill came to almost dkk and this is for a oneway ticket we could almost have taken a flight to oslo and rented a car for a week in norway for the same price tr for people car and food on board we had to get away with just over dkk i dont mind paying but there has to be a correlation between price and quality and apologies to dfds but there just isnt that here at all you are ripping off those who buy quottransport tripsquot so you can give away minicruises left and right and dump the prices for chinese group tourists
we have travelled with dfds many times the crew on board are very helpful and the ship is always clean and tidy if i need to amend my booking that is also easily done in a phone call highly recommended
in connection with an accident with the car in germany i received unusually good help from a serviceminded staff when changing my ticket from copenhagen to oslo thanks for the very good help
i was able to join a boat that left earlier friendly staff smooth crossing
it was a wanderful ferry excelent meal good service in bar and parking i hope to travel again soon with aura seaways not so much stairs from car to cabin unfortunately on the way back we have regina seaways with many stairs
really welcoming staff at crown when you travel solo you are often a rd class passenger but not here the buffet was good and plentiful there is entertainment for every taste around the ship all the time so unless you only stay in your room you wont get bored had bought sightseeing in oslo and it was worth all the money
dfds are good operators the ships are clean and well maintained the staff good the food excellent
we have sailed both with crown and pearl there is a big difference between the staff it seems as if there is a very positive working environment at crown we do not experience that at pearl otherwise we are very satisfied with the cabins
why are the checkin counters on the righthand side of the vehicle when checking in in dunkirk in france we all drive on the right and drive on the left why does the person driving alone have to get out and go around the car to the right to check in its not very comfortable in this cold time of year please explain kind regards gnter fritz
just got back from a mini cruise to amsterdam this morning we did this crossing at this time last year and stayed two nights in amsterdam the terminal in north shields is terrible its like an abandoned warehouse that they have thrown a few seats in there are toilets available but i cant comment on their cleanliness theres no vending machines or any shop available to have a coffee while you wait to board which is a bit of a fiasco everyone books in and they say boarding should start at but we didnt start boarding until approximately minutes before they closed the check in desk after going through customs which was one guy checking boarding cards and passports we made our way outside to a double decker bus which is totally unfit for purpose we had young children elderly people and people with obvious disabilities all trying to cram onto this bus ridiculous they should try and source an old airport transfer bus that has plenty of places to put baggage after travelling a vast distance of about metres to the vehicle deck of the ferry we all had to dismount from the bus and walk gingerly along the car deck which was worryingly slippery and had numerous obstacles on the deck which were a trip hazard this dangerous walk had to be carried out by young and old and children in pushchairs i hope if someone ever slips on the car deck they sue the pants off dfds once you get on the boat though the staff are great
we usually have fantastic trips with dfds but unfortunately our most recent trip went a bit sideways firstly when we entered the terminal carpark the barrier was raised and the machine displayed the message that parking would be free this turned out not to be true upon our return when we along with quite a number of other people were told we would have to report this to the security team who were already set up inside the terminal charging our cards the higher price for parking without paying this felt very unfair also the rules regarding alcohol at the onboard duty free had changed so that any alcohol purchased could only be recieved at the very end of our trip once we were back in newcastle i feel this change of policy or new rule should have been explained or outlined before we had purchased the trip as this also altered our plans once we were in amsterdam to add to this it took far longer than usual to debaord the ferry casusing nearly an hour delay at passport control this subsequently meant we had less time than usual to visit the city and finally an issue which i appriciate is not entirely the fault of dfds the entire corredor on deck where we were staying was occupied by a group of young people all belonging to the same group who were extreamly loud and shouted at each other and slammed doors untill the very early hours of the morning around am making sleep nearly impossible untill then all in all a very disappointing trip this time although i would reiterate that we usually do have very good trips with dfds on the mini cruise
i have been travelling with transmanche since it started in as i am rebuilding a house in dieppeon the whole the service is very good and of course im very pleased with the ferryhoweverover the years i have noticed some things that could be improved communications could be betterlast trip the hour ferry was latewe had no explanation from any member of staff or the captainof course we understand windstides and the problems of sea manship but it would be nice to be informed as some passengers on the other side of la manche have to make connections whilst waiting on the keysidealthough the cafe is open its a long way from the head of the queuemotorcyclists and cyclists are exposed to some aweful weatherof course they dont know when the ship will loadwhy dont you provide some shelter down thereyoud make money with a small cafe on the whole very goodand of course im very pleased but you could make it even better
really good sailing trip with dfds the service level is top notch friendly and accommodating staff and children are not in the way
the best part of the trip was being understood i traveled alone i dont speak english and i dont even speak danish but i do speak norwegian and i was happy to see that the people working on the ferry were patient kind spoke slowly and communicated well enough with me i bought everything i needed and got information when i needed it so thank you very much
the recommendation on the dfds website as well as direct ferries is to secure the best possible price which means the earlier you book the better the price far from it days after my booking there was a price reduction of which for my booking amounted to a whopping euros the shipping company which sets the price and direct ferries simply responded to my complaint by saying they accepted the booking conditions yes thats true but i relied on that the earlier i book the better the price completely misleading and unfair advertising so just dont book early would be the solution
not long enough on shore in amsterdam hours approx due to delays not enough information given regarding delays coach dropped off and no direction to walk to central amsterdam given staff on board ship were lovely though
very good price for day trip to calais for my family collect our christmas drinks had an excellent lunch in the lovely restaurant au calice and saw the amazing calais dragon and christmas market ferries were exactly on time and good catering on board
i had made a booking for six people with a departure date of november upon arrival in ijmuiden at pm it turned out that due to the storm the boat to new castle would not sail until at least pm or might not sail at all i was not informed about this in advance at all also by sms or email there was nothing indicated on the site at the time either so i had taken a day off for nothing and my traveling companions with two young children also used their petrol for nothing i find it scandalous that you are not properly informed in advance about this major change and that you are allowed to travel to ijmuiden for nothing the people who had chosen to wait until half past nine in the evening in case the boat did start sailing could not get off the boat in new castle because the boat had to sail straight back to the netherlands unless they would arrange for a hotel themselves you will not get your money back because dfds blames it on powerlessness so you just have to hope that you can find another time before march to set a date with the entire group scandalous compensation or compensation would be justified
there are no refunds if you buy tickets but not travel this is more difficult time not so accurate some time to late open door to late evacuate not respect time other important thing if someone coming late then he should pay very expensive tickets
dover to dunkerque and the return on nov was simply an enjoyable stress free and comfortable crossing we find that this slightly longer channel crossing two hours never feels rushed and pressured and allows a sense of time for relaxation
the ferries were more or less on time which is pleasant for onward journey friendly staff on board
had to make some date changes which were very efficiently handled by customer services trip itself was fine went smoothly no complaints
everything was excellent as usual from the crew at dfds the weather wasnt but never mind they made everyone feel comfortable despite being delayed due to a bad storm thanks dfds
delay hour and minutes to frederikshavn delay hour and minutes from frederikshavn and no information delay minutes arrival in oslo the rest was good
always a good crossing in terms of duration and location of ports could improve the speed of loading perhaps buy a new vessel which is more efficient to load unload ok a second hand one then ask the scandinavians they know how to do it fast
felt safe despite very rough sea on the way out staff was courteous greeting passengers and generally helpful ferry was clean including the restrooms much improved from one of our previous crossing i am sorry to say that on a previous occasion two members of staff a male and a female were laughing and talking loudly in the middle of the dining room while the safety instructions were being announced i went to ask them if they would kindly lower their voices so that we could hear the instructions however this crossing was very good
rather than allow car drivers to rejoin their cars ar the same time as truck drivers i suggest you ask them to wait until trucks have left the ship then car drivers can rejoin their cars and avoid sitting for sometimes an hour suffering the noise and fumes
i was always treated by very pleasant staff at dfds and they do a little extra without hesitation was shown a quick way to my cabin my hip wear down it was nice the music on this tour was very lively and fun but on november insensibly i had to leave
impossible to book a crossing online annoying boat just keeps bobbing website isnt going anywhere
we have travelled to newcastle with dfds many times at least times on the mini cruise or was it already times and several times to start our scotland holiday also by car the last mini cruise was with our young grandchildren there was also a great offer for children on the crossings including whale information this made the trip completely stressfree without exception we always had very nice crossings special mention should be made of the always friendly and very helpful staff on board whenever possible we book a commodore cabin which is a little more expensive but the relaxation begins as soon as you step on the ship we will be back
the sailings were punctual as always however it takes an age to offload cars at newhaven
i had booked a cruise for march myself online had to cancel the cruise a few weeks after booking it is over months until the trip was supposed to take place they still charged nok in cancellation fees even though they did not perform any customer service in my case i then paid nok for nothing also not very pleasant customer service which meant i then had to read everything in the fine print in the general terms and conditions there was nothing about this fee in the travel confirmation there was also no visible writing in the offercampaign pure fraud strongly recommend choosing another company
we travelled on the newhavendieppe line every weeks and we have never had cause to complains as everything is good the personnel on the desks staff on board are all very polite and helpful
i sailed a trip from klaipeda to karlshamn and had booked a place in a shared cabin with berths for euro the same as you have to pay for one whole room in a or star hotel on board the ferry i learn that i have to sleep on a bed of approx sqm together with wild strange men one is moaning and snorting and has a severe cold the other has apparently not had a bath for a few days and smells strongly of sweat all three lie farting and snoring through the night how can you in any way defend selling such an inferior experience i will never use you guys again by the way thank you for getting me infected and now i can spend a week at a stretch
excellent immaculately clean ferry very comfortable seating reasonably priced excellent friendly french staff who speak english also
pleasant treatment and good service quite expensive in taxfree and very expensive in copenhagen but we have norwegian politicians to thank for that who have driven nok into the ditch
easy booking quick easy boarding generally good all round put us on an earlier ferry no fuss
we go to dover and back with dfds at least times a year and we are satisfied every time
the crossings were both rough but i enjoyed both of them the out trip was delayed by minutes due to adverse weather and this was fully understandable the trip back was on time although the weather was bad i had breakfasts both ways which was about an extra in all but considerably better than previous breakfasts that i have had on dfds transmanche ferries i stopped having breakfasts due to quality but i am reconsidering this for future trips the toilets were considerably cleaner than they have been in the past despite the weather and long may this continue there was no soap in the mens toilets which has been a regular thing and i feel that the dispensers should be filled more often overall this was star comfortable travel
bad start with an unpleasant meeting with the customer center when ordering and changing when dfds advertised with something they could not deliver the boat trip was ok with very good service in the restaurants both ways but with poorly cleaned cabins to copenhagen on the trip to oslo the commondore class cabin was so narrow that there was only a bedside table and lamp on one side
really helpful staff we had an aunt who passed out on board the ship and the staff were on full alert and did what they could to help as if they had practiced it many times before and everything was under control so you felt like you were fighting with your hands thank you for the lovely effort your employees we were away from and homestay
both voyages were comfortable the return crossing was made in rough conditions and the announcements were helpful staff were always curteous
i say this every time i do one of these weekends but it would be nice to have one extra hour in amsterdam four and a half hours is not quite long enough time to explore especially when you factor in the walk back to the bus drop off our room was very comfortable however there was a very strong smell coming from the drain in bathroom on our second night be warned in the past passengers have bought wine from the duty free to enjoy in their cabins however this has been stopped alcohol can only be collect from the shop when reaching your final destination this means paying for a bottle of prosecco from the bar onboard overall a good value little weekend and nice change of scenery book your meal in the buffet before you are onboard the ship in advance as its euro per person
dfds has an outstanding app imho one of the best aspects is the process by which the details of passengers can be imported to the booking by scanning their passport no need to worry about transferring the incorrect passport number and expiry date its done automatically i gotta say the whole booking process was so much easier than other ferry companies sailing out of dover and thats the reason for giving dfds stars
simple at each step to book the ferry to check in on arrival and to disembark quickly facilities on board were good seating toilet and restaurant the fish and chips were ok but too much batter for the fish
ive been a loyal customer of dfds ferry service for many years and their commitment to excellence never fails to impress the dover to france routes including the hour sailing to dunkirk and the hour journey to calais consistently offer a seamless and enjoyable experience one of the standout features of dfds is their exceptionally friendly and helpful staff from the moment you step on board the crew goes above and beyond to ensure passengers feel welcome and comfortable their professionalism and attentiveness contribute significantly to the overall positive atmosphere of the journey the efficiency of the service is commendable with timely departures and arrivals that align with the advertised schedules the convenience of these short sailings is a major advantage for travellers allowing for a swift and stressfree transition between the uk and france dfds has truly set the bar for a firstclass ferry experience the reliability topnotch service and the consistently friendly demeanor of the staff make it a clear choice for anyone travelling between dover and france as someone who values a hasslefree journey i can confidently say that dfds will remain my goto ferry service whenever i visit europe
we had a great time on the princess ship lovely staff ferry getting old but still clean cabin small but worth price as a double a pint which is ok as amsterdam is over most places buffet breakfast is ok for prebooked easy to board both ways recommended bus transfers both ways overall dfds provide a good service which i will pass on to friends just a shame amsterdam is just a total litter zone as well as lawless bicycle riders and car drivers constantly approached by drug dealers this has nothing to do with dfds but if you want to go on hols hassle free and not walk on dodgy pavements and smelly drains with food and sick from the revellers the night b try another city like dublin thanks dfds tuff on amstetdam wont be back
boarding was straightforward we were given regular information about why departure was delayed the tannoy announcements were kept to a minimum sleep resting not disturbed service at the bar was fast efficient the staff were very friendly welcoming the only glitch for me was that it took an hour from returning to the car until actually disembarking
had a wonderful cruise friendly staff the minus point however is the bunk bed you can hardly get in with the stairs
staff always friendly and give service with a smile at check in and on the boat ive tried the rest but these i consider to be the best
a rough crossing but the staff managed it well one annoying detail was the hand drier in the womens toilet was not working this was also the case on the previous voyage eight weeks ago otherwise both crossings were good well done
the crossing was a relaxing and pleasant start to a long journey i found your staff to be very pleasant and friendly especially the waiter during dinner
easy and comfortable and we got on board in norway the day we showed up a good hour before it sailed
excellent crossings a la carte restaurant good food and inferior wine very friendly staff very helpful too big differences between the commodore class on the different boats
firstly there was delays boarding in newcastle with no valid explanation as to what the holdup was and when it was likely to be resolved apart from theyll be here when they are ready no apologies etc the rooms were so hot you couldnt sleep not to mention the lift doors constantly banging arrives in amsterdam another delay getting off the ship to then try and board the bus which was full had to wait again eventually got to the city for around pm to have to be back for pm this is not classed as a day in amsterdam back to buses to be delayed again to not having enough transport a mini bus turned up with no toilet facilities we were told to get on this mini bus which we assumed was leaving immediately it left at pm due to having to wait around for taxis for people who were stood in the pouring rain for hrs
a good crossing of the channel despite the wind and choppy seas good announcements with plenty of warning about potential delays
on time clean ship helpful staff good food and we were almost first off the ferry
we traveled with a pet dog and we were given a dog bowl by the lady at check in nice touch and well run ferry
everything runs smoothly at dfds from checkin to the day in newcastle and the delicious food in the evenings very friendly and helpful crew princess seaways once again a great experience
arrived early at calais there was no problem getting an earlier crossing back to dover
well organised and flexible with timetable very helpful and an excellent support by questions due to the stormy weather and cancelled ferrys
on getting to dover the dfds colleague updated my incorrectly type numberplate and moved me to a ferry that left earlier this flexible approach we gratefully received no drama customer focused and easy good facilities on board wifi worked on the crossing without incident
sails to frederikshavn only when there are quotenough guestsquot as we experience it experienced cancellation on the way down to frederikshavn we moved departure day and also on the way up to oslo there was a cancellation from frederikshavn got an offer to travel to copenhagen from skagen by car which we declined for environmental and financial reasons cancellation from frederikshavn even though the route ran as normal between the capitals i must have been extremely unlucky that both departures were cancelled attention i would also like to draw your attention to the fact that stena line lsfergen had arrivals and departures on the same day as dfds cancelled and lsfergen arrivals and departures from the same quay area in frederikshavn
we have travelled with dfds on several occasions before the quality of the journeys remains good well done keep up the good work thanks c l c
great experience even though the sea was rough the crossing was still ontimethe staff were very helpful
it was a great experience because of the storm we had a delay they notified me with a text giving me the option to reschedule for free however i continued on the scheduled journey which i enjoyed a lot good food good accommodation great staff they even gave me a voucher to spend in the duty free shop on board to apologize for the delays and the short minicruise stay in newcastle loved it
ferry was cancelled due to the storm i get that what i didnt understand is why neither of the contact numbers we were given are answered i had to go to the port to get any info rebook now hours later im trying to find out if tomorrows ferry on which im rebooked will actually go ahead phoned within the advertised office hours and still no answer if youre going to cancel a ferry than at least have people answer the phone and a surprising number of people were turning up at the port for their ferry with no idea their ferry was cancelled shocking customer service update to the reply and i can assure you that the phones were not answered and none of the other people in the queue with me at the port to sort it out were getting through either both numbers uk and french just hung up
the return journey from oslo was great unfortunately the outward journey was cancelled because of the storm the return journey had to be rebooked i dont understand why they charged a euro fee for this especially since it was all due to a storm and not our fault
it was good value i loved the commodore cabin it is my third time recently and i simply felt happy i am grateful for this newhaven to dieppe crossing
the ferry was on time the staff were lovely especially the lady checking us in the refreshments on board were a reasonable price and the seating was comfortable great service all round
everithing was good booking service ferry and punctuallity so very good experiance
we have to be at the boat a long time in advance if you have not reserved a table you have to wait a long time before you get a table while there are plenty of tables in the restaurant where no one is sitting very friendly asian staff dangerous stairs to get out of the top bunk very long wait before you can disembark then a very long wait for customs all in all an hour and a half before youre on the bus to newcastle so you will arrive there later and you will also be picked up on time total hours in newcastle is return by bus and then you will spend another hour in customs upon arrival in the netherlands you have to wait a long time before you are allowed to disembark and you end up standing in line for passport control again we will never do this again
we thought we had missed the boat we arrived minutes before the departure time and we were the last car allowed on board absolutely great so nice thank you that saved us hours
it was the second time with dfds the first time i took an outside cabin with a person description which was already a great experience but yesterday i decided to take a commodore cabin highly recommended everything was good both times very friendly staff and evening meal and breakfast also very good for pricequality ratio we will definitely go to norway or another destination with dfds again soon
i booked a ferry crossing for a motorhome only to realise id booked the incorrect date i emailed and called dfds immediately and they told me it was my fault i couldnt have a refund and it would cost me to amend the booking i couldnt believe it surely theres a law to prevent this people make mistakes all the time i wont be using dfds again disgusting behaviour
the kbhoslo ferry arrives in frhavn at where we want to book the journey from but have now for the nd time this year experienced that it is significantly expensive to order the same cabin on the last half frhavnoslo this time it was almost dkk more expensive for the same and cheapest person cabin at dkk which otherwise cost dkk from kbh no help etc understanding of strange pricing policy when contacting customer support by phone it will be a nothanks and i hope they change this absurd mismatch
on time friendly staff clean smart boat
very helpful staff and great new ferry luna
telephone staff really understanding and flexible on rearranging crossing dover to calais due to unforeseen circumstances and not making a fuss about arriving a little early for both outward and return crossings cant fault all staff praise being a better description who ive spoken to both on phone and on the ferries
the trip back from calais was seemless the trip out from dover wasnt as easy with a delay of over an hour the french side wins easy their access is so much better too
the cm bed which became cm dfds minicruise we have just been on a minicruise to oslo we we had ordered a commondore de luxe with window with double bed and great was our surprise when we get a cabin with a bed that is cm wide then i dont want to see the small double bed that you can also order if you measure the bedside tables together it might be cm we got cabin number we tried to change our room to a better one but got the message that they only help on the way out and not the way back therefore we next did not sleep on the trip and the reason why the experience was not as expected when we got home we therefore sent a complaint to dfds we were very surprised and disappointed by the reply thank you for contacting us regarding your recent journey with dfds it is sad to hear that your experience did not live up to expectations and that you did not get to sleep on the journey i have been in contact with the staff on board to investigate the current cabin you have stayed in they can confirm that the width of the double bed is cm in cabin number for information the bed in the cabin with the smaller double bed is cm wide in cases where you are dissatisfied with the cabin you have been allocated we hope that you contact the reception on board as you did in this case as this gives us the opportunity to resolve the challenge in the situation having said that it will only be possible to change cabins as long as corresponding cabins are available at the weekend we experience more travelers on board with a small capacity of cabins available wishing you a continued good day and a good weekend to that we wrote we are somewhat surprised that they say that the bed in cabin is cm wide we always have a measuring tape with us and it clearly showed that the bed was cm wide we are very disappointed that the staff say that the bed is cm wide that is downright untrue this worries us as we cannot trust that the cabin we may order is equal to the one you get but we have no way to prove our claim didnt think we needed to take a picture with the targets on
when i raised an issue with running water sounds in my cabin there was an immediate reponse and i was allocated an alternative cabin when the fault was confirmed all of the staff involved were totally professional and supportive i was also impressed that the system immediately recognised that i had moved ensuring full passenger accountability
dfds seaways sailed with my son and i on friday october unlucky day booking number it also happened when pearl crown ran into the quay and had to lie down for several hours before we could sail again and therefore we didnt have much time in oslo but what happens is that dfds seaways decides that everyone on board gets free food and drink on board the boat the entertainment for the children was super good and the staff were super nice and helpful and not least did a lot to inform all on board were offered to use the facilities on board until and then leave the ship and have the journey replaced which was a super service all in all dfds seaways gets stars because they did everything in their power to ensure that we guests on board had fun had a good time and felt comfortable it is a service out of the ordinary and you must remember to meet this with stars thank you for being so nice everywhere on the boat
decent checkin perfectly fine cabins but it is a big minus that you dont get the cabin until fifteen minutes before the boat leaves when you travel by car it is far too long to wait to enter the cabin
i have traveled with dfds on their newcastle amsterdam route and their dover dunkirk route i highly recommend travelling with dfds travelling with dfds is a fantastic way to start or finish your holiday on the newcastle amsterdam route the crew onboard are always extremely friendly and are always available to help the entertainment onboard king princess seaways is always good with the guitarist in the navigator bar and the band in the columbus club the food onboard is top quality in both restaurants the sky bar onboard both ships is always great in the summer the cabins onboard currently are tired and outdated but its good that dfds have announced that by march both king princess seaways will have cabin updates in some of their cabins the vehicle loading and unloading is always extremely smooth and professionally executed the crew in the car deck are equally as helpful as the crew in the public areas even though both ships were built in the s they have been extremely well maintained by dfds even since my first trip onboard in the ships have gone through extensive refurbishment
unfortunately i didnt catch the ferry home its my own fault i know i contacted customer service to see if there was an option for partial compensation a discount coupon a giftcard anything instead one got an instructive remark that i had to consider it quotexpensive lessonsquot so my feedback is just an advice that the experience could be so much better if you just showed understanding listened for a moment and expressed some sympathy its free money doesnt matter i have written a post on linkedin it is interesting to read the many empathetic comments you are welcome to contact me if you want to know more good day
we are frequent travellers with dfds and always get great service
keep increasing the price while im booking my trip this is the second time in the last three bookings within three months when such thing happened very disappointing the trips themselves were fine
easy to change time of sailing when arriving at dock
missed my booking time because of motorway closure was put on next sailing without any extra charge
we booked travel from copenhagen to oslo for friday october it was the worst of the storm and the forecast was easterly winds with an average of ms the villages can thus become worse we had intended to take the ferry and have a quiet pleasant journey and wake up feeling sleepy in oslo instead of the risk of getting stuck on the e north of gothenburg when the traffic is diverted at the e slip we chose not to use our tickets and drive instead seasickness and poor sleep are anything but calm and pleasant we did not report our absence as we had failed to report this according to the existing rules but dfds called and asked where we were about minutes before departure very professional i think
we had booked a trip with dfds from kbh to oslo on october we decided not to go because of the weather as we were not comfortable sailing in the big storm we had prebooked x course menu for dinner and x breakfast buffet for the following day a total of dkk which has been lost they refused to give back money that we had paid in connection with booking a table at restaurant explorer unbelievably bad service not being able to get money back for food that was neither prepared in advance nor arrived we could not cancel food that we had not even ordered yet as you simply paid a certain amount in advance when booking a table the fact that you do not give the money back for the food which is not an obligation to have to pay in advance when you sail with dfds but which we simply chose as a security to have a table at the desired time is laughable in addition to that i can now read here on trustpilot that the guests who were on the boat got a free dinner after the ferry sailed into the quay but we still have to pay for meals for people that we havent had incredibly unfair treatment of us who with clearly good reason chose to stay at home
staff are friendly and polite directions clear cabins neat and clean meals neatly prepared and more than sufficient cabins very noisy no insulation between the walls at all dfdss response to this comment in the review was that we had better report this on board immediately if you are regularly woken up at night by talking quotneighborsquot it is of little use the next day the neighbors woke up from the quothittingquot of the waves and quotgrumbledquot about it among themselves the fact that it wakes you up indicates the degree of noise it wasnt screaming or partying or anything like that prices on board for coffeetea etc are quite high boarding and disembarking takes quite a long time and does not go smoothly through customs the order of rows and who gets on or off board first is not clear and illogical as a layman
giving stars because there were some things i think could be improved liked st we were informed in good time about the change of the time the staff in the restaurant were very nice we were in the restaurant which is on the th floor what i didnt like was the cleanliness of the bathroom i understand there is a lot to do but the sink didnt look good completely yellow inside and around the faucet very disgusting completely brown like its been year since no one touched it shower full of stains it looked like blood the internet is expensive and doesnt work at all it goes out all the time when we were about to get to the boat from denmark the lady who was sitting to look at the boarding pass got identification from me and without looking at it asked if i lived in norway i reply that i live in norway and that there is a photo on my id and said that it was not a passport when it says on their side that id cards and drivers licenses that were not electronic could be used as id i am satisfied with the rest
overall the trip was good french staff were pleasant and courteous the food was good the ship was clean and tidy and the toilets were clean too however this was a night sailing departing dieppe and arriving newhaven boarding was quick so most folk were settled well before we set sail to get as much sleep as possible but no the loud tannoy announcments continued til after midnight and then we were awoken at with ladies and gentlemen we will be docking in minutes fifty minutes is it really necessary to wake us up so early surely it could have waited until and the pre voyage announcements could be wrapped up by when boarding was complete im glad i didnt pay for a cabin with a nice bed only to be kept awake before departure and disturbed so early before arrival so for me everything was ok but the tannoy needs to be reviewed for timing sensitivity and consideration
we regularly travel with dfds friendly staff always do their best for the traveler in short excellent
th ferry was clean and bright with good facilities shops and a delightful premium lounge staff were really friendly and helpful our departure was late but otherwise an excellent service
although the ferry was very full the staff and crew were as usual professional and friendly the ferry it self was very clean
we were booked on the ferry from calais to dover we arriver an hour ahead of time to be told that both that sailing and the next were fully booked and we could not get a ferry until pm hours later i had assumed that as we had booked a specific ferry at a specific time our place would be held
friendly and accommodating staff even in difficult situations we were out during the storm during the autumn holidays fridaysunday when the ship hit the quay in copenhagen they did everything to ensure that we were comfortable while we waited for the ship to be checked for damage and whether we could get out and sail afterwards we waited until the morning to make sure the storm had subsided so we could sail out safely we were safe and secure the whole trip
unfortunately the unfortunate thing happened that the oslo boat sailed into the quay however the captain had tried to take that into account by having a tow boat it was really a shame but the way it was handled was so good the staff were helpful throughout the trip and we got regular updates about the pa system and due to the circumstances dfds chose to provide dinner lunch and drinks for free to the passengers good style so thank you very much for your good service it also went beyond your working hours but really think the employees and the management should be praised
it was simply the best experience with dfds even though ship was one night late good food was offered it was awesome would like to travel once again
i arrived early on both days i was travelling and i was allowed to get on an earlier crossing
dieppe newhaven overnight cant recommend this crossing as by the time you embark and get your cabin it is nearly midnight after the announcements about the cafe and then when they start up again you probably get around hours sleep and you need to be out of your cabin by am french time am uk the ship itself is ok a bit old and staff are ok cabins are comfortable and showers are good probably better doing one of the quicker routes and get a ibis hotel
friendly great time on the road the only point for improvement is that information from checkin to boarding could be improved
it was the first time travelling with dfds and i had to make changes it was straight forward and easy to do the ferry crossing was comfortable and straight forward
just got off the ship had expected a nice day trip in oslo which would mean that you could hardly get around oslo departure on left at the time when the wind then pushed the ship into the dock where it just had to be checked where no time estimates on when we would sail then a little later it turned out that we wanted to sail at at you sit and think quotwe should have sailed minutes agoquot minutes later the captain says that due to these weather conditions we will stay overnight and sail tomorrow saturday at where we would then be in oslo around and then we would sail back to denmark hours later again so we would be able to be in denmark at the same time as planned but its not enough to be back in denmark as planned the trip was supposed to be to oslo not on the ship i dont understand that you havent canceled the trip just like all other companies and companies that sail with passengers on the water have done but i guess it depends on money if you avoid people getting off and postponing the trip then you can still make money versus if you say people can get their money back those at the reception on the ship could not promise anything about any kind of refund of any kind that we should call customer service ourselves and arrange something with them as they had nothing to do with it there is really a lack of staff talking to each other both on land and on the water the only reason for stars is that the food was okay good at quotlittle italyquot all in all a rather sad experience to be with oslobden hope we can get our money back and not an indifferent credit note
worn mediocre food and a little too much bilka and far too little cruise if it had been cheap the price was commensurate with the quality but no a trip with the slow ferry to oslo is expensive and once youre on board it just gets more expensive with overpriced drinks a ferry ride at full speed to oslo would be better than slowing down so far and selling the ferry ride as a kind of hotel stay
i have enjoyed using your company but the fact that you only offer the trip from kbh and not from frederikshavn i dont think is good enough especially not when all your prizes from various promotions only apply from kbh so someone who lives close to kbh can get a cheaper price granted we can just drive over there in petrol plus bridge times plus parking so it is again a wild price for a north jutland
everything went very smoothly we were even able to get on the boat earlier because it was delayed smooth service you always know where you stand
after seeing many advertisements online i was excited about a minicruise to newcastle on the way there it went quite smoothly quickly past security friendly reception and a relatively clean room there were still some receipts from the previous people but okay it was fine the boat left on time we had an inside cabin with a double bed the boat squeaks and creaks on all sides and you sometimes wonder whether the boat will make the crossing at am there is a loud announcement through the box in every room that we will arrive in two hours this seems very unnecessary to me in the morning a note was slipped under our door stating that we were picked up in newcastle no less than hours earlier due to strong winds this meant that we ultimately only had hours to spend in the city of course i understand that dfds has no control over this and can apparently unceremoniously shorten the minicruise considerably without any form of compensation the staff on the boat can hardly give you any information and you will not receive an update via email on the way back we left hours earlier but arrived back in ijmuiden hours later so a warning to all travelers who are thinking about a minicruise be warned in case of strong winds it may be decided that you will be picked up earlier without compensation or the like after receiving a standard email asking if i would like to complete a survey about the trip i will receive an email in which i will be compensated with a discount on the next minicruise within the next months this is nice but it would have been nicer if the apology had been made immediately on board and compensation had been made on board during the same trip
self booking did not work when boarding caused heavy queuing the atm on board was out of order when we had to land it took minutes to get through customs i was glad i wasnt on a day trip in oslo then you would have spent the time standing in line
everything is ok but what i noticed is that it is much too cold on all ferries air conditioning too cold
unfriendly staff sea view cabins far too small and far too hot air conditioning hardly works which means you are almost forced to spend way too much money in public areas that are well ventilated that whole boat is old stuff and in need of a thorough renovation unfortunately dinner reservations without drinks will result in a hefty bill during those two days i heard no many times not possible not possible cabins were booked next to each other according to the lady on the phone none of that i didnt sleep well everything squeaks and creaks and it felt like i was lying right above the engine room paid extra for a cabin with a sea view but you cant turn your back and the window is completely weathered and can hardly be seen through you will only be in newcastle for a few hours because the boat leaves at pm with passport control and delays it takes a long time before you set foot on english soil i thought it was a drama with dfds i dont recommend it to anyone youve lost an insane amount of money for nothing really
first time for a while i was able to book quite quickly on the phone i have purchased a set of tickets but it is so difficult to book crossings the boat was modern the quality of food and drinks is always poor we miss the waitress service restaurant which had better quality food
our first trip aboard dfds we had a great time slept well great food commodore de luxe is the way to travel
we had a lovely time on the dover to dunkirk way wonderfull staff all verry helpfull we were able to get boats earlier free of charge will saillant again with them
great staff at the port and an excellent crossing departed minutes early too
all staff were excellent ship was comfortable and cabin was good only issue of the whole trip was queueing for customs at borders but this was not in the control of dfds
good of first time experience on cross border ferry
all good the boat the staff etc not happy with the charge of to get on to an earlier boat as i had an issue at home and had to come back earlier than expected when on the ferry it was almost empty so cant quite understand why its so expensive
paying extra for upgrade only to find holes in walls and dirty sheets the buffet was cold and dry and had been out for far too long and was probably leftovers from the day before a lot of it the service was extremely bad there was not a smile to be seen on the staff who worked there in addition everything took an extremely long time it took time to pay order and get food the shuttle bus was a nightmare not enough buses came so ended up having to take a taxi i will probably never travel with dfds again not worth the money
i recently for the first time travelled via the ferry to amsterdam and then back to newcastle it was two overnight stays and one day in amsterdam so many people recommended doing the ferry trip and they all had amazing things to say they said that the ferry is basically the highlight of this trip as there is so much to do and the staff are amazing and the restaurants and such i was so excited for this trip i booked it for my girlfriends st birthday celebration i had high hopes i work in a hotel i have worked in customer service ever since i was old enough to work i never complain im easily pleased as long as the customer service is good i tend not to make any issues however the customer service during my time on the ferry wasnt something i can just sweep under the rug not once in the entire time i was there did i feel welcome the guests on the ferry made me feel uncomfortable i am aware that is not your fault i thought well at least the staff will be nice surely i think out of every staff member i metspoke to there was bartender and housekeeper that actually smiled at me or were just genuinely nice normal customer service the rest of the staff made me feel just as uncomfortable as the passengers they were rude made it seem like they werent listening or had no time to talk to me no positive facial expressions i felt like i was bothering them and if it wasnt any of what ive just stated it was them staring at me honestly i believe i was being judged as i am a woman with my woman partner i felt like the entire ship including staff were judging me for being who i am it was sort of like nobody had seen a lesbian couple before anyway it truly spoiled my trip to be honest because like i recently said i work in hospitality i am nothing but nice to guests and i go out of my way to ensure they feel comfortable listened to and helped i just cant wrap my head around why everyone else in this business is not the same i had the buffet the first night at the explorers kitchen i pre booked in online for something like it was decent however im a picky eater so there wasnt a lot of choice if im honest when we were in amsterdam we tried to find somewhere to take food back onto the ferry we didnt end up having enough time so we had to book back in for the buffet i would say we had about plates each the bill came and it was euros the panic i felt when i saw it was unreal it literally used uo the last of my cash i assumed it would be the same price as the night before but i was dearly mistaken having plates of food cost me that much i tried to speak to a staff member really politely and asked even for a partial refund and i was practically ignored so that was the icing on the cake for me my little trip away was ruined by the people that are meant to make it a nice experience
we were early to check so we got an earlier boat we have this company few times now and will recommend it to friends and family
the ferry was good and lovely staff but on the way back from amsterdam to ferry has one bus driver his really bad with no have any respect to any passengers we wait under strong rain more than minutes he didnt open bus door and not let anyone go inside bus his really bad driver
the ferry was alright nice people and helpful but they told us that we have to be there oclock for the bus to get back to the port i went there minutes befor and it was strong rain the driver wouldnt let anyone on the bus until there was old people and kids under the rain he wouldnt care about the people
fairy chaotic boarding with cars being squeezed in at all sorts of odd angles consequently at disembarkation further chaos as there was no obvious priority about who drove off when and no crew around to manage the process the crossing itself was ok apart from a rather vocal party of older people drinking their duty frees and trying to outcompete each other on holiday anecdotes finally but out of your control a shame the newhaven level crossing closed just as we arrived at it and remained closed for what seemed a long time
cost of trip good boarding and unloading was a bit slow issue with credit card payments was also a drag
we have a property in france and always used la shuttle as they offered a frequent travellers system since their prices have totally gone through the roof we obviously have looked around at the ferry companies we are very very impressed with dfds the staff were very polite the boat very clean they served hot food and sailing was on time am booking next trip
i have been travelling with dfds for many years and i cannot understand why i had to get a cabin on the king that was in such a bad condition unfortunately no remedy was and could be found i had cabin
this was the th time to uk and as always great the boat trip is still a nice stopover and rest point during the journey everything was arranged down to the last detail and never had a complaint
lack of information regarding delay bad service on board
the dfds ferry to newcastle is simply the best and most comfortable way to travel by car to northern england and scotland
all good helpful staff sailed on time ship was clean
nice boat easy crossing great staff
slow boarding and even slower disembarking added an hr to the outbound trip and mins to the inbound trip boat is comfortable and booking process is easy but the delays at each end of the journey eliminate any advantage in using dieppe instead of the tunnel
everything went smoothly only a little delay on both the outward and return journey maybe start importing cars a little earlier
a good experience from start to finish we arrived in good time for our crossing and were transferred to an earlier one staff were very friendly and helpful and we did some christmas shopping in tge dutyfree shop whats not to like
the cruise itself its great value for money and cant fault it but unfortunately costs on board the ship are quite expensive which spoil it
on time easy and quick to board crew pleasant and although old ferry with tired decor it was clean
all good generally helpful staff and prompt departure food and drinks prices too costly however not your fault but lengthy uk border control was an unexpected and unwelcome delay
the reception on board was very customerfriendly thanks to our many crossings we know our way around pretty well but it is always nice to be welcomed by friendly staff gr
we enjoyed our outward journey but was disappointed with the delay in disembarkation the same happened on our return trip it took ages to get the lorries off and the long que of cars to immigration control we will consider the tunnel next time
greeted politely and helped with changes to the ticket neatly arranged
you need a certain amount of flexibility on a ferry and doubling the price on the last day is a disgrace the seats arent occupied anyway so there was no reason to charge us double the price there was no announcement at the dock that we had to go back to the car the toilets werent allowed to be used before we docked which is a disgrace
on time departure and arrival service on board and helpful which is important when travelling with two dogs suggestion there is a mad rush as people want to get to their cars perhaps you might announce foot passengers then people with cars on deck then people with cars on deck then people with cars on deck this will make passage down the lifts and stairs easier perhaps also people with children strollers and people needing assistance go first
very easy boarding left and arrived on time clean and comfortable on board
can anybody explain why dfds prices have risen information requested from dfds amsterdam to newcastle wednesday may at adults ferry crossing to newcastle x motorhome m x m newcastle to amsterdam wednesday november at adults x motorhome m x m om uur overtocht x camper m x m newcastle ijmuiden woensdag om uur volwassenen x camper m x m notice the difference in price yes the one from last year is in gbp but still only euro thats a big increase from euro to euro in one year
the crossings to and from newcastle were very smooth starting from boarding the car and ending with the disembarkment the personnel on board is very friendly and competent the food evening dinner and breakfast buffet although there should be more emphasis on organic food the only thing for serious consideration is the temperature in the cabins on the forward trip is was way too hot with no chance of coolig down so hardly any sleep was possible and also and the backward trip the temperature was too high for a comfortable sleep
food prices are high and the ferry price is very expensive
checking in and parking the car on the ferry went well depart on time friendly and helpful staff wide range in the store arrival according to schedule
travel regularly with dfds and they have a friendly attitude towards the customer
no announcements in german with the majority of passengers being german
you could think that it was the first time that dfds had to have cars with the ferry there was absolutely no control over the queue which led to total anarchy some had arrived several hours before the ticket window opened while those who came at the last minute could skip the queue and drive quotdirectlyquot through while the rest of us could just watch
i arrived well on time and dfds transferred the booking to the next sailing so great
good timetables clean ships staff helpful like france newhaven is very convenient for us
i think this was our first crossing with dfds the only service lacking was the wifi the crossing was smooth bar service was adequate and the staff friendly we shall certainly use dfds again but please upgrade to wifi which is available on other ferries
timely departure clean facilities and efficient crossing
in the tax free shop only one young badly speaking woman behind the till what gave long cues and draft carlsberg was was not on and got charged for a small bottle of carlsberg charged the same as for pint british customs very slow to make sure we had no chance to visit the taxfree shop before boarding
we had a travel credit from covid which was lost last night due to dfdss completely unnecessary complication of new bookings it would be so easy to deduct the new booking from the old booking before covid on the same booking but instead you have to buy a completely new journey and then hope that dfds might refund your old order within days probably because it becomes so troublesome and unsafe for you that you give up and they score your money it succeeded here as well goodbye money and goodbye dfds
as a trucker using ferries twice or three times a week dfds are never on time charge too much facilitys on board are filthy food is russian menu which is half cooked or else recycled next meal and burnt these are the worst ferry company ever you will end up sharing a cabin even though you have paid for a single on your own they have a lot of catching up to do with other ferry companies who do what they say steer clear of dfds if at all possible
ease of boarding with flexible schedules the stay on the boat was pleasant and comfortable
travelling from dover to calais on the saturday we had allowed minutes in case of delays at dartford and in dover which we had experienced before no delays so we arrived with time time spare and intended to eat packed lunch while waiting we were offered an earlier ferry and still had time to eat lunch returning we arrived bang on the time dfds recommended to allow for processing and were amazed to be offered an earlier slot we were the penultimate vehicle to board and the doors were closing as we parked dfds staff clearly make every effort to be friendly in more than one language the areas we were in we kept clean and tidy
good guidance and information in advance we were able to take a boat earlier very handy
always use dfds especially since po did the dirty on their staff never had a bad trip great boats great staff
a really bad company i have traveled with almost all ferries in scandinavia but the only one that opens up access to cabins minutes before departure is dfds this also applies on the return from copenhagen when you have a cabin i would absolutely not recommend this company if you dont want to experience standing like herring in barrels for a couple of hours before you get access to a cabin the prices on board are also expensive if there are no offers on board you can buy cheaper alcohol at lidl in copenhagen so dfds is proud of what they call quottax freequot they buy in tax free but put on such a large advance that it becomes more expensive to buy than alcohol bought with tax in copenhagen my last trip with dfds put a couple of hundred swedish kroner for train travel and take tallink siljaviking line from stockholm instead better price on cruises better ships better prices on board and above all when you are let on board you can go directly to your cabin without having a herring in a barrel experience
flexibility on ferry crossings ease of access both going and returning from france
ship was well maintained clean and staff were helpful food was appetising and reasonably priced crossings were smooth on both occasions whilst loading seemed to be well organised unloading especially on arrival back in newhaven on september was slow we were back in dock for around minutes before anything seemed to move
always had a good experience with dfds on their uk routes but very disappointed to see the increase in bike charges on the amsterdamnewcastle route this gives a really bad signal in times when active travel and pollution reducing measures have to be taken i dont see how this can be justified at all plus that extra expense makes it less certain that i will use the service again in future
everything thing was good apart from the price for cheapest cabin and a car not even in summer i know inflation is bad but more than double normal is a bit much ive travelled a lot with dfds for years i brought sandwiches on board instead of a meal because i thought why give more money
crossing made from dunkirkdover its crazy that you have to pay for your dog while the dog has to stay in the car on the way there we were only allowed to board last at the back of the trucks because we were traveling with the dog upon arrival it took a long time before we could disembark we were allowed to sit on board among the cars on the return journey we were not told on the outward journey that you can visit your dog in the car if you indicate this at the information desk it is a pity that we did not know this because the crossing was very turbulent we would have liked to check with our dog how things were going in the car both crossings left exactly on time
i woke up at because the boat rocked a little and i doubted whether i had pulled the handbrake it was a little stressful when we parked so i could have easily forgotten about it went to reception and a friendly guard walked me and my adult daughter down to the carriage deck to check fortunately for that because the handbrake was not pulled no sour faces just a good friendly attitude we could safely go to bed again
pleasant crossing from dunkirk to dover despite the rough sea conditions drive in and out volts the ferry was a little late on the way back but everything still went smoothly neat transition to calais
loved the ferry trip ship and personnel are great especially the breakfast was super however boarding at dieppe was very slow letting folk wait for almost two hours why and does the night trip take two hours longer that the daytime crossing or is that just my imagination still stars hope to use again
easy right from arrival with selfservice checkin sweet staff on board and very pleasant crossing the wind said meters per second we couldnt feel we were sailing the evening and breakfast buffet was delicious and very reasonable prices in the sandwichcoffee bar and the taxfree shop
it was my first trip with dfds and i had a good feeling right after booking the ordering process is simple and clear telephone queries are answered competently and in a friendly manner the crew on board are very helpful courteous and obliging the cabins are clean and functional the buffet is highly recommended and there is also plenty of entertainment on board making the crossing entertaining
getting through passport control at newhaven was troublefree the ship was clean and tidy food was fair quality and price seats on board were comfortable enough to catch a couple of hours sleep id very happy use the service again
ok as a ferry well on time staff is doing their best but these ferries are showing their age cleanness of lavatories are not the best
times by ferry in weeks x across the channel and x wales towards ireland and back this was the most expensive and the worst broken furniture and toilets dirty and filthy really outrageous for what you have to pay for it check in lady was very nice but that was the only bright spot
departure on time boarding went effectively staff were helpful and welcoming sea was calm with a south westerly docked in good time overall very pleased thank you
on time departure and arrival good onboard services
we booked enough travel before quotdance gala cruisequot was announced on their website and were then never offered tickets it was because of this that we were a group who were going on a trip but unfortunately missed a lot as it was not possible to get in until after about pm there were therefore many people who were disappointed and cursed by this and felt cheated on the kielfergen color line there are never separate tickets when there is a band on board so if you have tickets for the trip you get in an idea to think about for dfds too
my husband and i travel from newhaven to dieppe return fairly frequently between may and september when dfds run three services each day and wish that this was the same throughout the whole year provision for foot passengers has improved with better shuttle buses between the ships and the ports clearer announcements and improved signage facilities on board ship are good with a well stocked shop a restaurant offering a variety of meals snacks and drinks as well as a bar the lavatories are clean and the new toilet paper dispensers are a great improvement
sailings were on schedule as booked however not so sure about being advised to arrive hours before sailing really need better facilities particularly at dover if have to spend so much time there
friendly staff nice and tidy boat enough and tidy facilities working wifi all over the boat well done but theres but thats taken the fifth star we had booked seats in your relax lounge after a seven hour drive through the night departing from dunkirk at am we were all looking forward to a short nap alas that lounge was closed you upgraded us to premium with complimentary drinks and snacks and baked goodies a bit stale from yesterday still which was very nice and as we were all alone in the lounge we could nap on the various sofas pity that we had to ask at your desk for the correct code and things couldve been issued at checkin
the journey was very great the commodore cabin in the etg very good also the lounge in etg with direct access to our cabin
no problems on departure or arrival everything ran on time recliners on board could do with refurbishment butapart from that no complaints i especially like the newhaven dieppe route because of the lack of trafficqueuing in and out and dieppe was ideal starting point for travelling to south of france
the ships are clean and sail on time
pleasant polite staff efficient put us on the next available ferry when arriving early at calais port
always runs smoothly we were even allowed to go on an earlier boat
when i called dfds to book trips to copenhagen i got in touch with maria who turned out to be a very helpful and friendly customer service representative dfds must be grateful to have such a good employee
ive used this service several times and its always consistent on dover calais dover dunkirk i like how on an economy ticket you can still take one boat earlier the boats are always clean the food is always mass bulk canteen style but fine the duty free shop is more than booze fragrance and tobacco and priced marginally cheaper than the high street all the ships have wifi and its always been good enough and reliable embarkation and disembarkation is always organised its a good way between the uk and france i just wish there was a uk belgium service
we arrived at the pier earlier and could immediately take the boat this was the case on both the outward journey and the return journey
efficient friendly staff clean boats punctual service no delays on either leg of the trip will definitely travel with dfds again
keeps prices reasonable ferries keep to schedule no frills but good as no pressure
very friendly helpful staff from checkin through to loading staff and onboard i like the smaller size of the ship everything easily accessible excellent competitive pricing and easy to add to or amend the booking with no admin charges my only wish pet friendly cabins although i appreciate the dieppenewhaven crossing is fairly short
we traveled with our dog for the first time with dfds in a pet friendly cabin the cabin was dingy dirty shower curtain dirty floor and squeaked and creaked throughout the flight the pet deck was spacious and had plenty of opportunities for the dog to do its business unfortunately many dogs also did that in the hallway in front of the cabins and the urine came out under the door of the kennels with a pet friendly cabin you are really in a bit of a corner with the old stuff it smells bad everything is less beautiful and you know exactly when you are making the transition to the public areas and other cabins the cars are so stacked together that you cannot open the doors you then have to move yesterday i made the crossing with another company and what a difference it was bonus it was even cheaper
everything went very smooth from booking to travelling
timely departure smooth boarding lots of sickbags as rough weather reassuring staff kept informed
everything was good on board very friendly and competent crew unfortunately booking additional services eg mini cruise amsterdamnewcastle is not that easy online but the staff at the terminal were great they found a quick solution straight away
bad customer service we called customer service and tried to change a travel date for health reasons after much discussion in the background at the customer office of dfds we were encouraged to use the travel insurance if you want to start mixing insurance in you have to pay a deductible i have received this trip as a gift unfortunately customer service was not willing to cooperate to change anything here one should have been more customer friendly a dfds trip a gift with a twistwe get a reply from dfds that it is just to cancel the trip which is a gift and already paid for and then add the trip again who will pay for that trip then should the person who gave the gift be involved bad customer service o
we had an enjoyable trip one comment to improve my wife is somewhat disabled and i had also indicated this when booking so the car was parked near the elevator great however our cabin was at the back of the corridor deck a meter walk and almost impossible for her suggestion also give passengers who receive a yellow lift ticket a cabin near the lift
we were in scotland last autumn and everything was fine this year however i was shocked that the trip from amsterdam to newcastle cost three times as much more expensive ok but three times as much
traveling with the dfds went well friendly and willing staff a few tips the time between checkin and boarding was unknown to us it took about an hour and a half we would have liked to have known this in advance due to sanitary visits dinner is tied to a certain time which was not so clear to us fortunately we were assigned a table instructions for turning off the internet on your phone could be clearer in addition to turning off wifi and roaming let the traveler know that the automatic search for network must also be turned off manually in the settings we were now faced with additional costs of broadcasting announcements was sometimes only done in the hallway please also make all announcements in the cabins now sometimes we missed a part because we had to walk to the hallway
we left on time on the return journey we were suggested to take an earlier ferry to calais instead of dunkirk since we got there early this saved us h time thanks for that
expected a certain standard but have probably had too many trips with a line that has a significantly higher quality the boat waswellneeds an upgrade the bars were disappointing and when you cant even make an irish coffee youre in for a treat a little too much quotfree before drbaksundetquot feeling value for money nothing to brag about
asked to be at the port hours before departure to allow for extra security checks the actual check took minutes so we waited for mins in direct sunlight parked along an old wharf wall the inadequate toilet block and just vend machines a long walk back from the front of the queue on board the queuing system at self service food area very confusing with people bumping into each other ending with one poor old man dropping his tray of drinks seating was ok as the boat was not full but not helped by people reserving lounger seats whilst they went off elsewhere return trip took nearly minutes to disembark and clear customs for just a cursory glance at passports
ferry on time staff pleasant
possibility to take a boat earlier peaceful crossing
all well apart from being recommended to attend newhaven port hours in advance lengthy wait at dock food at buffet ran out had to wait in car for one hour before unloading at newhaven dieppe all went well
we arrived early and were transferred to the first ship available saving us time for our onward journey good to see such flexibility plenty of seats and attentive staff
i have been on board with dfds three times in recent weeks and have been really impressed staff are always smiley and friendly and onboard facilities are good i have needed to make changes to our bookings and have been really pleasantly surprised that this has been an incredibly smooth process with no additional charges to be paid
as always dfds is flexible and reliable friendly onboard crew
we had not used this transport before but will certainly do it againit was beautifully laid outthe seating was comfortable and furniture in there was well laid out giving you spaces to sit and relaxwe had a cabin and it was well worth the money as we didnt realize how tired we were till we lay down and both had a nap feeling refreshed and ready to shop in the duty free
dfds cruise blues at sea was a raw prelude to autumn with five really good bands from the old man vidar busk to the debut couple ask carol over two days we were well pumped for the blues when we entered vippetangen after the cruise good atmosphere good sound and dancing waiters added flavor thank you for a successful and professional event
i used to use dfds as a nice stay but that stops now i have booked a luxury stay for my sister as a birthday present at the end of october but have been prevented from going i cannot be allowed to rebook so the departure is the day before even though i have been told that there is room on the ferry that sails the day before my departure however they were so nice that i can cancel my trip but with cancellation fee never ever use any of their promo codes or offers unless you are sure that you will not change the booking or cancel it you would otherwise believe the lack of customers when the times i have been there have not been close to full on the ferry and they are giving stays away for no money left and right its quite a marketing strategy they have i wont be using them again thats for sure
on the way there we took the king seaways and back the princess seaways there is a big difference between the two boats the king is fine but the quality of the princess leaves a lot to be desired the boat itself the food and the beds could use an upgrade
we arrived much earlier than required at the harbour and we were offered the opportunity to board another ferry leaving earlier at no extra cost friendly staff during check in and onboard
good catering on board so you dont have to spend too much time apart from sleeping in the rather cramped cabin boarding and debarking always runs smoothly and as quickly as possible on such a large ferry booking is straightforward but for the following year it is only available from around september th the bed in the double bed cabin has an uncomfortable metal edge that makes it difficult to get up but thats just complaining at a high level the ice cream in the explorers kitchen has also been better
today i spoke to thomas from dfds to make a discount ticket purchase i have to say that my communication skills are affected by the fact that i have complex ptsd in that i sometimes get confused by even small things like please repeat that when that happens my worms come out wrong thomas instantly put me at my ease and the purchase was seamless which in itself is unusual for me on phone sales i now need to mention dfds i already had a good promotion price for my ticket but being over actually over now i got an extra off which is amazing in these times of austerity so if youre thinking are they any good the answer is yes they are and especially thomas who is very good indeed ive traveled with dfds for over twenty years now and apart from one menstrual ticket checker at calais there has never been a problem and on one occasion when i needed to return home early as my grandmother was terminally ill in hospital all fees were waived by dfds happily she didnt die for three months but thats another story
all went well but we took hours minutes longest crossing ever from newhaven to dieppe sea was flat calm so no apparent reason for the extra time spent on the journey
staff friendly cabin clean departure and arrival on time unfortunately we didnt know that dfds also offers a bus transfer so we took a taxi we could have saved ourselves the trouble
hey we had to cancel our trip and were first told we could get half our money back but in a subsequent email it seemed one of your staff had made a mistake and we can not get reimbursed at all it seems we booked a nonrefundable crossing but when booking that was not clear maybe you can highlight that in the future
the crossing was ok but the minutes wait to get off the boat was too long
the ferry was fine but the dutyfree shop ashore should be in contact with the shop on the ferry and dont tell lies the wine we purchased on the ferry cost us less than the identical wine in the dutyfree shop ashore how is this possible
went on the mini cruise to amsterdam and have to say it was amazing the staff at dfds was really polite and helpful once on board cabins was clean and the beds was really comfortable the staff with in the restaurants was amazing always happy to help and the service you receive of them made you feel welcome and appreciated they could not be faulted for anything and the food was to die for transfers where quick and easy made my holiday a lot better definitely recommend travelling with dfds and will be booking up for another tip soon
automatic rebooking to an earlier ferry also with competitor pampo
had to travel home due yo family emergency tried to sort inlineon the phone wanted to charge extra fee rather than just allow ticket in another crossing few days earlier shabby customer services booken when got to port man on kiosk charged about which was mire reasonable wint book with you again back to p o who we have used for approx years
great ferry lovely helpful staff
september outbound september inbound newhaven dieppe hassle free boarding enough services onboard fast disembarkation will use again
from frederikshavn to oslo february we tried to book this departure date shortly after you opened the sale of winter departures from frederikshavn to oslo at the end of august we usually use you and have previously received a free car so before we ordered we called and inquired about a possible offer we were told that if we waited to order until september the car would be free of course we followed your recommendation and were ready to order the day the campaign started on september but when we have to order and book suddenly there are no available seats from frederikshavn everything is reported to be sold out and only passengers from copenhagen can bring the car so on the first day of booking there are no more places from frederikshavn but lots from copenhagen how can it happen that you recommend us to wait when only so few places are put up for sale we are two families who have always used you when we go skiing in norway never have we experienced this that everything is sold out even at your request to wait even though we were out in good time and mysteriously we can travel from copenhagen on the same date with the same ferry and by car without problems etc lene
general conditions on ferry is fine and the service on board is fine however if you try to book two motorcycles for two people in the same cabin the price for each motorcycle is more than double this is not appriciated and what if it is husband and wife should they then pay extra for staying together think one price guru at dfds got it all wrong
most of the trip was nice bus transfers were well organized in amsterdam but not in newcastle too little storage for luggage and the bus transfer from newcastle station to the ferry terminal was very chaotic in the bars only one type of white wine is served which is too expensive
journey was good from dunkerque to dover i could board although i have been late und already checked in for the next wessel sailing from dover could be done one hour earlier with the next ship to calais instead of dunkerque only stars because i was charged eur for that without telling me at the checkin
i went to your office in dieppe to ask if we could change our booking for the evening sailing a day earlier and the young lady could not have been more helpful changed the booking for us without fuss and very quickly loading quickly and ship on time
i travelled with my wife as foot passengers on newhaven dieppe route on returning on due to a disability i travelled with my small mobility scooter the service was excellent on both journeys my scooter was taken together with myself and my wife on a van from terminal to the vessel where we went up in the lift with the scooter to our cabin the staff with very friendly and helpful at all times i cannot fault the service we received highly recommended
consider whether you will use dfds for the ski holiday dear dfds we are a family of generations going on a skiing holiday in norway in february at the end of august i am in to book cars passengers departing from frederikshavn oslo on february at pm however bookings have not yet opened i will try again on august now there is success and i can book before i click buy i remember that you previously launched a campaign in september where you can book early and get the car for free in return i call you and a friendly customer service representative confirms that i should wait to book until september st as you will be launching the campaign again cool i wait a few days and on september i can see that the campaign is now active its just that you have closed bookings on the relevant departure from frederikshavn i have traveled with you for many years on this departure and it has never happened before that it has been sold out before the end of september i immediately call customer service who says thats enough the wagon deck is closed i confront the person that i can easily book from copenhagen there arent that many explanations for that however i am promised that i will receive feedback if a dispensation can be granted it cannot in the following days i have contacted numerous dfds employees who all find it a bit mysterious that bookings have already been closed but with the same result there is nothing to be done about it i even suggest that we pay the same price as when departing from kbh but no we cannot be allowed to board from frederikshavn in my own postrationalization i can see that dfds are more interested in getting as many copenhageners on board as possible since they have the whole day on the way to frederikshavn to generate revenue on the boat from frederikshavn we dont have the opportunity to do that as we go directly on board and sleep but its just not right you have put us in a real practice situation where the family must now split up and arrive at the ski resort on sunday and monday respectively i have finished the rest of the family using dfds practice that you can be familiar with it greetings anders
everything was great boarding was quick and easy
we had an amazing crossing again really happy customers
great customer service managed to get an earlier ferry which was very welcome very friendly staff
booking is very easy and the people on the phone are very competent the advance information was also very helpful the staff from the car attendant to the welcome on board to the bartender were all very friendly and in a good mood the cabin was clean and completely adequate thank you for everything and we would be happy to come back
the crossing from dieppe to newhaven is more civilised than the calaisdover and calaisdunkerque crossings however on the night crossings the cabins with windows should not be more expensive than cabins without after all the view is non existent in the hours of darkness
the ferry is clean and tidy the facilities are really under control and most of all the staff provide a particularly good service there is plenty of room for the guests and all in all dfds has ensured a really good experience for the guests great finally keep at it
everything went very smoothly at calais there were of us in cars and we were all through the various stages before parking up in around mins the ferry left and arrived on time the perfect end to our holiday
travel klaipeda kiel september checking in in klaipeda was chaos after checking in at the gate it took more than hours to drive onto the boat lady at the information desk was very customer unfriendly and uninterested i had to pay the barmaid euros for plastic cups that were normally in the hut the cabin was good and clean by the way with the exception of the lady who shows you to your cabin the staff was unfriendly and not customeroriented in my opinion the focus is on freight transport and not on passenger transport too bad given previous experiences with dfds
ferryvleft on time very comfortable and good coffee
good once on board but a lot of queuing before boarding and after docking
we sailed from ijmuiden to new castle on the evening boat with our dog in one of the animalfriendly huts on september the wait in the car in ijmuiden took a very long time before boarding with a dog you are not allowed out this is a long time especially at high temperatures once inside from the car to the cabin it was chaotic and hectic the petfriendly hut was not human or animal friendly the noise of the engines was unbearable cabin so hard asked at the service desk if there was a possibility to get another cabin there was none but earplugs were provided they didnt help at all went back to the service desk again to ask if there was really no other option ultimately we were offered another cabin cabin where the noise was half as bad but still clearly audible out of sheer misery i bought headphones with noise canceling to muffle the sound we hope to have a better experience on the way back we fear the worst
on st september we had the boat from calais dover we normally go from dunkirk i was definitely not happy with the boat weve been over many times so have plenty of experience to compare but the engine on this boat seemed to be so unbalanced it felt like the boat was shaking apart the whole way it was a very unpleasant journey what was also annoying twenty minutes before docking when many want to go to the toilet before resuming their journey you find the toilets both gents and ladies closed for cleaning that should be done between sailings on the return trip we were at the dover dfds checkin at and found that nothing was happening at any of the checkin rows for minutes everyone just stuck there getting frustrated eventually i walked up to one of the booths to find what the holdup was and told they were changing shifts honestly how long does it need just to change which person is sitting there
i was moved to an earlier ferry when i arrived at the port
we always travel with dfds from duynkerke or calais to dover dfds never disappoints if you are a bit late for a boat you get easily boarded on the next one and the staff is always friendly and well willing unfortunately the border controls are not nice in france you first get checked by the french customs than the same check by the british times looking in the car i think that is not necessary but i know this out of control of dfds but it makes us probably not go to britain next year as it takes a lot of time sometimes to get through border control but dfds has always been great for us keep it up
we arrived at the ferry port at for our ferry when we got to the check in counter it was and they had put us on the ferry because we were there less than hours before we proceeded to wait over hours with young children so we literally sat and watched the ferry we had booked on sail away when we could have easily got on it
theyve always been brilliant with us need to get an earlier ferry no problem reissue of tickets no additional charge their online team is fantastic they come back to you immediately and always helpful great job
it is was it is ferrys are old and dirty but does her job service is good
everything was great it was great that we were able to take an earlier ferry on the return journey
friendly personnel please put in you annoucements that during the voyages the mobile phones should be put on flight mode if wifi is not bought i forgot to do it so some apps were updating in the night id did cost me
the trip was on time and we were permitted to disembark ahead of many vehicles which meant our onward connections were far smoother
we have used the services of dfds several times it is a super nice company and the service is fantastic if you need help you will get a person on the phone not a robot who will do everything he can to help you the service is also fantastic during the trip the cabins are clean and the meals are delicious there is always someone ready to help you i will only travel with dfds from now on
everything went smoothly the cabins were clean what really bothered us however was the use of plastic containers instead of cups for coffee tea etc its a shame for sustainability reasons it should be possible to use proper dishes on the ferry
we have been traveling with dfds for years what disappointed us on the return trip from newcastle to ijmuiden king seaways september was the breakfast based on the commodore class all other years there was much more space between the tables there were also tablecloths and we had the idea that it was a bit more exclusive than today the tables were very close together all in all we found it less pleasant the cabin was better cared for the refrigerator was better stocked and there were chocolates greetings peter verstappen
trip back from calais was awful arrived as requested via app to be held for three hours and then moved to later ferry with no offer to refund the priority boarding young children and kept on tarmac in queue with no facilities available wont use them again
arrived very early to both inbound and outbound crossing from newhaven to dieppe as the line oversells tickets and did not want to loose a place on the ferry because of this the wait in a hot car in a queue was a touch uncomfortable especially with a year old having said that passport and ticket control were a delight compared to airport security which always stresses me out usually parking on board went amazingly and as it was a lovely day sitting on deck looking out to see was amazing one thing to mention is ensure there you have brought plenty to do to entertain children as theres very little to do without theres only so many books and tablet you can watch for hours the soft play has a lot to be desired thankfully our little one loved watching the sea on the deck chairs so all on all a very pleasant journey both there and back i wouldnt hesitate to use dfds again though maybe change the ticket situation so everyone that pays gets on no matter their tia
we were able to take a ferry earlier on the return journey at no cost this meant we got home from the long journey hours earlier we will definitely book our next trip with dfds again
booked fairy was checked in on one family with small kids after hours of driving also arrived min prior to my booked time i know its not min prior but still doesnt justify hour delayed fairy you shouldnt oversell number of tickets or should at least let me know per smsemail you are delayed so much so i dont have to rush to make it in time terrible service always had excellent experience in the past years with dfds not sure what happened now if it wasnt for the kids i wouldnt mind but like this i am disappointed with lack of consideration and lack of professionalism person checking us in didnt even explain there is a delay and reasons behind it we had to figure it out ourselves seeing we are being redirected to an different waiting area instead of for the next fairy sailing out
we arrived for our pm calais dover trip on an hour early as instructed only to be bumped on to the pm crossing arriving home at am we both missed work today
we only met a smiling staff on board a thoroughly wonderful experience from the time we boarded on friday until we were back in copenhagen on sunday we had the bonus pleasure of seeing a lot of happy guests dressed up in s clothes for the party that was held on board we experienced clean and neat surroundings a staff who smiled and were welcoming good food both at the buffet restaurant and in the explorer a suggestion we had booked parking at the ferry terminal through dfds a picture on your website showing where the parking area would be nice a trip that the whole family consisting of adults and a yearold child all agreed we would like to do again
we travelled to france last year and again this year with dfds brilliant customer service via live chat and twitter who arranged last minute ferry changes for us also real time updates on their twitter account which greatly reduced our travel anxiety during strikes last year definitely our preferred ferry operators
generally good the ferry is much better to calais than the one we had last year to dunkirk but the childrens play area has been destroyed as anything beside a place to sit the captain seemed to faff about a bit with launch and landing so that added minutes onto our journey otherwise does what it says on the tin and got us to france and back i wont blame the customs delays on dfds
we had a great crossing good food and we got a early ferry
quick boarding well organised nice ferry
we arrived hour minutes before our journey were told that we were moved to the next ferry which was hours later that late ferry was then delayed by mins
the ship was on time and well maintained the crossing was pleasant the food on board was good and the duty free shop on the way to calais was well stocked an entertaining little sea voyage
we got there early and since there was still space we were offered the opportunity to take the earlier ferry the staff were very friendly and everything went smoothly and without any complications
the crossing staff food and ferry experience were all excellent disembarking the ferry was less than excellent due to the border controls it took one and half hours to depart the ferry terminal from docking as this was late at night it was a bad end to our journey there were three lanes checking passports and yet there were at least two additional border control staff nearby who could hopefully have multitasked to create at least another queue and ease the waiting time of course this is the idiocy of brexit at play yes there may be the potential for a vast narcotics bust or catching some illegal aliens but when its car after car of glum parents with their tired children you can see why the continent may laugh at us
price was excellent process of buying sailing was easy and straight forward checking in at terminal was easy and staff at all locations were exremley helpful
first trip on a ferry with kids and our own vehicle was all pretty straight forward on the way over to france calais was extremely busy and we were rebooked onto a later ferry without being told it wasnt a hardship for us as we had booked a hotel on arrival anyway but could have been a disaster for others with connecting journeys etc dfds were very apologetic and said it was the business weekend of the year and needing to get a french stamp in passports held up an already drawn out process wish the whole checks of the passports could be streamlined seemed a bit ridiculous not really dfds fault though so kids enjoyed the food on the ferry everything else was straight forward
everything worked out great we will definitely use the ferry again perfect
short way from car to cabin with our three dogs
the outward journey had a very nice view from the cabin over the bow we enjoyed the peace and quiet during the journey and arriving on holiday wellrested in the morning very extensive breakfast buffet especially on the return journey on the quotking seawaysquot friendly service a great start to the day its also good that you can enjoy the entrance to the port before going to the car decks the fact that the exit through customs takes so long is nervewracking but probably cant be changed overall we would start our next scotland holiday with dfds again
we were pedestrian passengers on this occasion a new experience the terminal in newhaven is well equipped clean comfortable and modern the dieppe side is more dated and although it has everything you need we were last on and last off the boat on occasions we were looked after and staff were friendly and helpful however on the final disembark we were first off which seemed to cause staff stress and i felt a lot like we were an inconvenience the vessel was fine staff were friendly and nononsense one set of female toilets was very dirty and smelly
dfds cancelled our return sailing from amsterdam to newcastle we waited in a queue for three hours only to be told the next crossing would be in five days time we were left with two small children in a foreign country in the evening with no support we managed to book another crossing with stenaline and spent the night in a hotel at considerable extra cost we have been in almost constant contact with dfds since as by law and as laid out in the eu regulations they are liable to pay us compensation their various sporadic and infuriating responses have been a we have no obligation to discuss this or offer any form of compensation as you terminated your booking b we admit you didnt terminate your booking but were still not honouring the eu regulations c after abta got involved you are due a refund but weve not given it to you because you havent given us your bank details despite having never asked for them d complete silence this is where we are now weve given our bank details told to wait days which has been and gone and we cant contact anyone either by phone or email were pursuing this via the legal route they are a disgrace and it has been a very very bad end to what should have been a lovely family holiday response to reply from dfds thank you for your reply can you please in some way clarify that my issues is with the claims department ive not been able to get a response from you since as i wrote in my review you said that i hadnt provided bank details despite never asking me for them you gave me your word that my query over compensation would be resolved within days that was on th august and it is now th september ive phoned several times since and send five emails asking for an update then asking for acknowledgement for my emails at the very least and finally to ask for the official address of the company so that simple procedure formally small claims summons may be served ive not had a single reply other potential customers please also note that dfds are not members of abta as almost all other carriers are this means they are exempt from the usual ombudsmandispute resolution services that protect us very poor indeed
from booking to the crossing very professional and courteous staff everything is perfectly timed the ferry offers all amenities
our return sailing from amsterdam to newcastle was cancelled and we were told that the next available crossing would be five days later we were stuck with two small children in a foreign country with absolutely no support we eventually booked another sailing with a different carrier and spent the night in a hotel at considerable extra cost to ourselves since then dfds have been at best dismissive and at worst rude and negligent in their customer care not to mention clueless on the eu guidelines in place that dictate compensation and reimbursement we have sent in excess of pieces of correspondence to date and have been told firstly that they are not responsible secondly once abta got involved that they were and would pay and now we cannot get in touch with anyone via phone or email they are totally ignoring us we are now seeking what we are due via legal action and via news outlets we will never travel with this company again they are a disgrace and it has been a very very bad end to what should have been a lovely family holiday response to reply from dfds thank you for taking the time to reply i find it very hard to believe that my case is with the claims department however your last contact with me was as i noted in my review to say that i hadnt provided bank details despite never asking me for them you promised to be in touch with me regarding my compensation after this within days that was on th august it is now th september ive since phoned several times and send five emails asking for an update then asking for acknowledgement for my emails at the very least and finally to ask for the official address of the company so that simple procedure formally small claims summons may be served ive not had a single reply other potential customers please also note that dfds are not members of abta as almost all other carriers are this means they are exempt from the usual ombudsmandispute resolution services that protect us very poor indeed
the trip was ok even before sailing one of mens urinals was blocked and overflowing some seats were looking worse for wear but otherwise it was a good price and roughly on time
online ordering not very userfriendly it was difficult to see how many passengers i could put up the driver and one i wrote we suddenly became also didnt get any alternative to a cabin and eight arrange it on board i am quite familiar with online ordering and have worked with it and programming and the important thing was quotuserfriendlyquot
is my th trip with dfds in this line and i am very satisfied from everythingi know that the pearl and crownare old shipsbut in excellent conditioni am very impressed from the behavior of your staffeverybody is smiling and very kindcongratulations
it was not our first trip with dfds the good standard has not changed even because of corona
i always travel with dfds i am very satisfied with the companys services it is great from boarding very good hygiene great service from staff smooth journey until disembarking
we are both walking disabled we explained on arrival that we could not go up to the cabin if we did not get parking at the nearest lift despite being signposted with this there was a hoist on our side of the deck far too late an employee came and showed us to the other side then the pain threshold for both of us was far exceeded we had to go to bed and stay there for the entire journey when we were called to the car deck the next morning we had to stand in a tight queue for minutes to reach a lift to the car deck then there was only our car left and we were both exhausted from pain we sail with dfds every summer and have never before experienced that it could be so painful now we hardly dare to do it anymore it cost tears because of the pain
great experience of a car travel over a big well equipped ship if there is a tax refund facilities setup on the ship or terminal just like in the airport at france it will be perfect for a full solution of the shopping tour and it will be a competitive edge to the ukfrance tunnel and also the train
travelled as foot passengers with two bikes from newhaven to dieppe return both ferries left on time and arrived on time food and drink on board was good booking process online not intuitive for booking bikes i thought i had booked people and bikes but had only booked bike needs to be clearer not a problem though as they just added the second bike to the ticket on checkin at no extra charge
after clearing customs in ijmuiden i had to wait hours in row to get on board distance less than half a kilometre our row was simply forgotten however commodore cabin was clean spacious bright cold drinks in fridge good coffee and tea making facilities would be greatly appreciated
easy check in very short wait before we boarded staff really helpful when we came aboard offered to show us the way to the lift and gave us a card to remind us of where our car was located and our cabin was spotlessly clean
kudos to everyone on board pearl seaways
lovely sailing beds were slightly comfy for our short journey when booked on line for the return trip it stated no cabins were available but when we boarded we asked if any were available and was told yes at we declined this price and slept on comfy chairs only trouble was that people behind us thought it was fun to constantly kick the chairs we would had moved but there was no other chairs available lights could had been dimmed for the journey other than the above the experience was good checking in was quick boarding was quick departing was quick
hello dfds i have ordered a rental property in hemsedal in norway for the family in week the situation is that on a normal skiing holiday you have your accommodation from saturday to saturday you have been slow to post tickets for so we had to book our accommodation without a ferry waiting for you now you have booked your ferry tickets and you have decided to only sail every other day which means that you can only sail home either on friday or saturday with the oslo ferry this means that everyone i use for ski holidays in norway will either lose a day of their holiday or have to take monday off its a shot in the head you are screwing over one of your biggest customer groups for the whole of january everyone is going to have to come up with something else but you now i must have canceled a skiing holiday far too late and come up with something completely different practice i hope you dont sell a single ferry ticket for ski trips in the future you should be ashamed
i arrived hours before sail time hour border controlmissed sail had to wait until and this was late by minutes there is zero control here probably nothing you can do about it but someone telling people what is going on might helpsome very angry people cutting in all over the place paid extra for priority boarding to exit the boat first ended being last group off they said that it was because i had a pet but the additional noise and wait stressed the dog out even more apart from that finebut its a from me
we went to dover although the newhaven ferry would have been nearer for us but found the staff very un helpful and couldnt careless however very different story at dover every body extreamly helpful from booking to sailing and landing i thank you
always nice and relaxed to travel with dfds maybe the announcements for kidactivities could be done less noisy
departures on time no waiting to board both ships look little tired but the staff and service was friendly and caring
we had a star experience on dfds pearl seaways me and my husband are spending our honeymoon in copenhagen and oslo we took the ferry to oslo and have loved our sea trip so far the food in the explorer restaurant was really tasty and the staff was friendly we even got a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate our honeymoon how thoughtful we got a window table and enjoyed the beautiful scenery while eating however the absolute star of the staff was definitely our sales person in the tax free shop wonderful mahmmud who was super nice kind so helpful and a real expert in mens fashion my husband found the best pants from a danish brand and bought two pairs thanks to him mahmmud is definitely a keeper and and was an absolute joy to have him as our salesperson next we are going to enjoy some live music and cocktails we still have the next morning of our trip to come but wanted to write this review so we wouldnt forget about writing it best wishes from finland
i always use the dfds ferry and i am very satisfied with your services recently the navigation directed me to dunkirk and i was supposed to sail from calais but the staff rebooked me without any problems for a ferry from dunkirk to dover and i am very grateful to them for that theres never a problem with you youre great best regards and thank you rajmund malecki
when we wanted to restart our car before getting on the ferry the battery gave up on us many thanks to the shore team member who kindly came with a car and pliers and helped us get going again just as we were beginning to despair good crossing for the rest a small downside for the restaurant which closed early during the trip
i have arrived early and they put me on the early ferry with no extra charge and no questions asked very friendly service
pros the trip felt safe enough the checkin was painless price was cheaper than po cons driving up the ferry was chaotic i was one of the first ones to arrive yet one of the last ones to be loaded into the boat there maybe a reason to this but it was not explained to me so it was very stressful someone cut the queue during loading the attendant saw it had a word with him but still let him cut the queue the ship was dirty especially the toilets both of my trips were late by about minutes attendants on the boats were not friendly give the relative price i will take dfds in the future again but will be looking for alternatives first
the queue system must be well managed and prioritised based on the ferry timings we missed our ferry and waited for long hours mid night with the baby just because they allowed other cars who came from the wrong lane and cyclists who cut all the queue and got into the ferry we missed our other connectivity and it costed us
friendly and helpful no problems with transferring an earlier boat
lovely staff clean cabin on the way out return journey again lovely staff please can foot passengers get off last at both ports and maybe if possible get another staircase down to the vehicle decks to help ease the congestion
no room on the ferry people sleep everywhere delayed ferry because customs takes too long to check also the mens restrooms are clogged
our sailing was on time which of course is extremely helpful nice choice of what to have for a meal and arriving on time so all in all would not hesitate to travel with
despite a hr wait getting through customs on way to calais it only took about mins for return well sign posted lanes easy to find waiting areas very impressed with food on board ferry especially the beef curry much better than airport food my only issue is that that outsideon deck viewing is limited
we liked the care and help from the staff service in the restaurant and a lovely time on the ferry
first time using dfds and will definitely use again both journeys we arrived at the port early and were offered the opportunity to catch an earlier ferry we paid for priority boarding which ensured we were then able to find a nice place to sit on the ferry really straightforward and the onboard duty free shop was also good definitely recommend
we were travelling with a month old and found dfds very accomodating helping us get on an earlier ferry and even arranging to have us park close to the lifts once on board excellent customer service
hello we have just been on a trip to oslo with the ship pearl seaways and there we three who were going on a trip and we are sorry it is strange that you can just check in without the person being there who has paid for trips and there was super bad service in seas and it was super cold and where we were supposed to shoot had breakfast on saturday there were only two people and they didnt show that there were three of us and we follow us monitored oppe commodor lounges that were in which monitored everything you went in or out it seems we are not okay in some way that they believe in some that you have access there and there was no control over anything and staff who were not welcoming or smiling and want to provide good service to people who want have a good trip and dont take that boat again
nauseated on the outward journey otherwise everything went well
the passage was well organised the cabin clean und the food excellent the ferry was on time on both days staff was friendly competent and helpful the ferry has got a good standard
the loading and unloading was painfully slow the return trip took over an hour the food was second class not what id expect from a french owned ferry as france is the food capital of the world the staff were polite and spoke good english the seating was comfortable sadly i doubt if ill travel through these ports again
we are very happy about the ferry crossing from frederikshavn to oslo and back but in the coffeeshop i bought a cinnamon snail and you cant be familiar with it a cinnamon snail should first of all taste of cinnamon there was no hint of cinnamon flavor and it was dry without any of the quotsnackquot that i always associate with that piece of yeast dough the price is otherwise at the top dkk it must be an ommer
everything ok except the wifi i couldnt get a connection and was therefore charged maritime rates euros for a crossing give better warning return trip was ok
nothing great about the travel experience but the ferry left on time from newhaven and landed in france
arrived earlier than expected but was unable to get on a earlier crossing however while the ship was boarding for a crossing staff approached a number of us awaiting our baked crossing and asked if we wished to board great customer experience and because of this i arrived back into the uk earlier so could travel home and arrive sooner thank you dfds staff
the reason for not higher is purely the organisation around leaving the ferry the communication about when to head for the stairs is slow and frustrating additionally as we stood by the lift with a couple with a man in a wheelchair a stressed member of crew came when the lift went from floor to and he told us to wait we hadnt tried to use the lift i explained that the lift had gone from and had my head bitten off id tried to help them identify where to look but wont bother again then we sat in the car for a good mins waiting to begin unloading we were one of the first on
great ship service and very clean everwhere the staff where extremely helpful and supportive
we took the late ferry back to the mainland it was fairly empty and thus quiet my toodler enjoyed running around she took a while to fall asleep due to the lights and excitement but we managed the trip was relaxed we will book again in the future
the first time on a ferry and it was such a nice blend of indoor and outdoor activities to keep the children busy options for food and drink throughout the trip the indoor soft play was brilliant on both occasions not overly busy although sometimes the older children are in there and since its not got staff to oversee it you need to keep a very close eye the star is dropped for the toilets whilst i appreciate it is on a ferry there must be a better way to contain the odours all in all a very pleasant experience and the very much glad we chose this option over the tunnel
on route to london and the time is am the star is for the rude disrespectful racist inconsiderate juan whom i made clear to him in simply terms is in high need of training as he is an embarrassment to dfds whilst we made our way out of the vessel this morning at am in newhaven we will be making a formal complaint stars is for the excellent customer service from an asset to dfds by the name of kevin i must salute and commend with utmost respect for a member of staff called kevin on the dfds newhaven to dieppe route mr kevin stationed at the receptionfront desk on the vessel is a man of honour and an asset to dfds i travelled with my young family and this last trip was nothing to write home about from the rudeness biased and racial behaviour from juan however mr kevin rose to the occasion and treated us with respect kindness and empathy mr kevin needs to share his wealth of expertise and excellent customer service starting with training juan mr kevin showed us that dfds affords better service and mindful of every experience onboard our experience was on the newhaven dieppe ship dieppe vessel and we travelled on tuesday and returned on wednesday travelling with children which included an infant we have travelled many times with dfds and it is so unfortunate to encounter such behaviour and lack of customer service for a second time with different circumstances from juan who portrays and boasts dfds will do nothing about our complaint there is a serious training issue for juan and i have to state it clearly however the hero for dfds which we must salute is mr kevin and he should and must be commended and rewarded god bless him
everything went wrong when ordering where and were advertised and in the advertisements dfds said travel for dkk per person person but there was no discount on our booking when we contacted dfds the next day they tried to get around it with several attempts in the end dfds said that we should have asked for the offer ourselvesit wasnt something that happened automatically thats how it is in shops too when there are offers dfds tried to convince us but dfds would try to find out if they could make the offer if we rebookedbut it couldnt be on the day we had planned and it wasnt half pricedfds offeredthey didnt say were multiple offerswhat rubbishdfds could just give us the offer for the already booked journey then it was so unfortunate that a storm was forecast and in the media people were warned to stay indoors and norway was particularly hard hit warnings of waterflooding in oslos streets we contacted dfds but they want to sail regardless of the weather we asked if we could cancel and get a refund but we couldnt we also couldnt rebook to another daywhen we asked what we were going to do in oslo if the streets had rained awaythe following remark came quite sharplyquotthen you can sit for the hours and wait in the terminal until the ferry sails back againquot hold up a servicewe left because otherwise the money was wastedit was the biggest disappointment of a minicruise which was supposed to be cozy and luxurious for dayson board there are no comfortable chairs sofas to sit on in and look outits only there if you sit in a restaurantthere was only the option to sit outsidewhich was most uncomfortable cold and windywe felt homelessal catering was outrageously expensive alm black coffee red slatten sausage dkk pizza and x pasta bottle of wine as well as x dessertfor the tidy sum of dkk wherever the lord is preserved at the nice restaurant you couldnt settle for coursethere were two coursesso this trip was a boring expensive experience nok and we will never recommend it to others but its also because dfds has a monopoly on this journey that they can behave rudely towards customers and charge skyhigh prices for bad food and bad servicehope there will be an alternative route in the futureso we can travel to norway and get proper treatment
just wanted to thank isidro from portugal and ilya from latvia who really helped us while on the ferry from dunkirk to dover straight after boarding our year old complained about breathing difficulties and was very distressed as a result of an allergic reaction to walnuts what a place to discover your child has a nut allergy it is very scary when youre stuck on a ship for hours in this situation we approached isidro and told him about our situation ilya joined shortly and they immediately took us to the premium lounge gave our son water sick bags and took the vitals luckily he fealt better shortly afterwards but they kept coming back throughout the journey to make sure he was ok even gave us meal vouchers and all free of charge a big thank you for staying calm and professional and helping us through this very stressful situation a word of caution even though the staff are trained first aiders to our surprise there was no medically qualified personnel on board but it looks like this is a norm for these crosschannel ferries overall we would recommend dfds
even before we boarded dfds staff were engaging with passengers and offering to show children the ferry nice touch very good customer service
our pleasure to be on the ship thanks for the safe journey both ways and well come back again soon best regards from family b
the staff is friendly and helpful the ferries are clean and nicely furnished its a shame that you couldnt go outside
the boat was new and very clean super good service
the boat from fredrikshavn to oslo was delayed none ie bad information for those who sat in cars and waited how about putting up a board that explained this
i genuinely made a mistake and booked my ferry a whole week too early i had got my dates muddled i rang dfds on the morning of the departure and the friendly lady on the phone rebooked my ferry at no extra cost for the following week amazing and thank you so much im more than happy with the outcome and will be using dfds again in the future
first time on boat everything was fine
we had a cabin that was so close to the night club that we we kept awake until two at night by very loud music this was not announced in advance about this cabin because we had to go home earlier than expected we wanted to change our date of departure by dfds this was not possible days in advance so we had to buy a new ticket losing the original one
the trip went smoothly and was comfortable with good facilities the loss of a star is that on the outward journey our cabin toilet facilities hadnt been properly serviced so the soap dispenser was empty and only toilet roll which was enough for us as it happened i didnt seem to have been cleaned it was much better on the way back
great service and minimal queues for the newcastle to amsterdam sailing
the way there went fine we are traveling with small children including a baby on the way back we had to park our vehicle in such a way that there was no room to get out of the car we had to go through the drivers seat window the stroller was therefore not possible to get to the passenger decks we had to crisscross a dangerous route between moving trucks the way back was completely dangerous we were parked so tightly that we couldnt reach the vehicle for a long time with four children under the age of running through fastmoving traffic to a vehicle is no fun the children were scared and we thought it was very dangerous staff drove right past the children at top speed
big boat clean and with a lot of services littorio bit expensive
i was impressed by the price but also by the service and how easy it was to rebook the outward and return journeys at short notice we were able to take one or two ferries earlier on both journeys thank you very much
priority passengers should also have their own lane and priority passengers should also be the first to go down there are so many people on the stairs that it is absolutely unbearable especially for parents with four small children
always an earlier ferry when available friendly staff and on time prices of good and drinks on board are too high for the quality served fix that and deserve the fifth star
i was shocked actually first time in years what i travel with dfds we travel with small child and we have sign in window about it when we drive on ferry there was so big chaos no parking help all cars just try to drive in peoples with small childrens go on down etage in end there already was childs who was running around when cars try to park also my child have no power to step all that hight steps on stairs and i need to take her on hands so bagage and child on hands with all this i must get up etages thats was not normal but have also good thinks like buffet was so good the food so fresh and really nice also lady in shop was super super super nice room was clean and fresh barman was so friendly and if not this accident with parking i will say was good drive
really nice to travel with dfds the staff is really friendly and the boat was much faster then expected
excellent service easy booking hassle free checkin flexibility on sailing timing great experience with restaurant and duty free shopping smooth onboring and offboarding process
first time on a ferry easy to follow signage easy booking clean facilities lady on the return ferry was especially approachable and in high spirits especially for am however staff are farrrr too loud during the night lots of crashing smashing of kitchen utensils lots of dragging of equipment and loud laughing shouting across to each other at am both trips please note that literally of passengers are asleep or at least trying to the lighting in the blue recliner seat area is far too bright for what is supposed to be a place to rest sleep in fairness i could have bought a blindfold type thing
always go dfds from dover now efficient and timely loadingoffloading clean and modern facilities great staff good meals great support when rearranging trips followed up quickly with amended booking documents
checking in getting the car in and out and staying on board was fine smooth crossing between dover and dunkirk
the checking of all formalities the shipping of the cars and the service on board duty free shop food and drink on board were very goodwell organized the ship was on time anytime again from calais to dover and back
best company for cross channel ferries by far
i received fantastic help from nora at customer service to book us a table even though it wasnt really available she was solutionoriented and confident and now im just looking forward to traveling in october
my trip out to dunkirk was excellent helped by being allowed on to one sailing earlier as the delay was much less than expected on my return i was day earlier and i was disappointed to be charged even though my ferry fare had been fully paid many weeks ago to be allowed onto a very light cargo ferry i would have given stars otherwise
great crossing newhaven to dieppe return good and affordable route to france the ferry was dated but there was food and drinks available ate in the restaurant on the way out in june plenty of choice and food was adequate coming back we left dieppe at there was a mad rush of people carrying pillows blankets etc and they were sleeping in every available place under the stairs curled round tables etc the sleeper chairs we found were not very comfortable but we managed to snatch a bit of sleep before we docked back in newhaven at am only real negative was the duty free which was woefully poor on available items to buy
great service very good pricing for august got us on earlier ferries when we arrived early would recommend
efficient check in clean ship etc
clear communication possibility to catch a ferry earlier on site biscuits for the dog being the first to cross the ferry with a pet to keep the travel time as short as possible
arrived early at the port and was put on the next available sailing without any cost
we were very happy to travel with dfds again everything went smoothly rebooking due to family changes was uncomplicated the staff were friendly and helpful we can absolutely recommend it
check in was good a little late getting into dover no seats on the outside deck as someone who likes to be outside the whole journey these would help the experience
what a great service from dfds and david from their newcastle office our car broke down in bordeaux and couldnt be mended in time for our return so we had rearrange our tickets our hertz french replacement hire car could not be brought across on the ferry into the uk and so we had to leave it at calais and come across as foot passengers with our luggage as well as our two boys aged and and their car seats not easy also as the dfds dover route does not allow foot passengers we were in a total panic as to how we could get home david was super helpful and within the hour had rearranged our tickets as well as arranged for us to come on board with the help of dfds calais and dover local staff and ferry dfds staff and a lift in a dfds staff van everyone at dfds knew about us when we arrived and including those on the ferry it was a really great service all round from dfds especially as we were super tired and stressed from the breakdown thanks you dfds you have great people working for you nick eva henry alfred
smooth service able to go on a previous boat twice smooth operations in ports
i was there minutes before departure and got a boat later minutes extra wait but this also gave us the opportunity to take a drill earlier on return without any problems beautiful boat and friendly staff
easy booking luckily arrived with time to spare as delays at uk border lenghthy
this is the email sent to dfds i travelled on your ferry from newcastle to holland with our car on arriving in holland on returning on arriving in newcastle on we have travelled with dfds on the same route for years and always book commodore deluxe and have always had a great journey this time however it was not previously we were always given a yellow commodore card for the car which was hung on the interior mirror indicating commodore class and the car was loaded onto a car deck with more room this time however no yellow card and hardly any crew members directing cars and loading them just a handful of young kids who really didnt have a clue on the outbound journey to amsterdam our large series bmw was directed up a ramp onto car deck door which was far too small for cars and had strapping for bikes we told the crew member a girl with a two way radio that it was unsuitable for large cars she told us her boss told her to load the cars on this single row and to fold the mirrors in then all passengers have to leave the car and walk behind the car while it was moving meanwhile there are cars moving behind me onto the ramp with their passengers having to do the same this is clearly a breach of health and safety regulations what if a passenger slips while walking on a car deck while vehicles are moving behind its an accident waiting to happen when we docked and were disembarking my husband had to drive up and manoeuvre onto the extremely tight area still with no mirrors where i had to stand and wait until he cleared it and then get in the car the images i have attached clearly show the completely unsuitable area in question the return journey was not much better this time it was car deck door this area is clearly only suitable for cars two abreast yet they were squeezing a third row of cars in the middle another young girl with a two way radio stopping the cars and again telling us to fold the mirrors and the passengers to get out and walk again we stated the area was too small for large cars and was she going to guarantee our car would not be damaged her pathetic reply was you can have a good sleep and all will be well this situation is completely unacceptable and not surprisingly when we arrived home and washed the car low and behold there are scratches on the car at the rear drivers side photos attached and before you hit me with you should have reported it on the ferry nonsense we are not telepathic nor do we have a crystal ball there was not a mark on our car before the car was squeezed into areas far too small for large cars we are raising a complaint regarding this as the situation is unacceptable their response thank you for your response from which i am sorry to learn of your continued disappointment i can confirm that you have contacted the right department and this matter cannot be escalated any further with dfds i can advise that all complaints received within dfds are handled by the customer relations team to be investigated and responded too this dedicated team works within both company and legal guidelines to ensure all decisions and outcomes of customer complaints are handled fairly equally and without prejudice for all i understand that you did not report the damage you mentioned to the ship with that in mind we have no evidence that the damage you referred to occurred whilst onboard our vessel i have forwarded your feedback to the relevant department for their review once again thank you for taking the time to contact us kind regard dfds my reply in reply to your email how i repeat how in gods name can you report damage to your car when the car decks are closed with absolutely no access until the ship docks the next morning and youre allowed on the car deck for departure well you and i both know your section is a con the only way we could know if the car had damage before we disembarked was to consult a psychic or crystal ball if this is your answer then heres a suggestion keep the cars decks open so we can inspect our cars for damage while sailing but i have raised this issue with your ceo and director as per my previous email and will be putting this on trust pilot footnote you have still not addressed the health and safety issues raised the total disregard from your crew when we were driving onto the ship and informed them the pathetically tiny parking space was not suitable for a large series bmw was met with total indifference for a company as large as dfds to treat loyal customers who have spent thousands of pounds over the years travelling on this route in this disgraceful way is unacceptable regards rita baillie
lovely ship very reasonable food and beverage prices and a well stocked duty free shop embarking and disembarking was smooth and easy thank you dfds
if you arrived earlier in both calais and dover you were rebooked onto an earlier ferry
disliked the fact that we got there early by racing through belgium only to be delayed because we didnt get picked to go on the boat we were supposed to be on
the only thing i can fault transmanche dfds with is the time it takes to disembark the ferry it took h from the moment we entered newhaven port to the time we were able to drive off and continue our journey it was very uncomfortable also to be still on the ferry in our cars with some people having started their motors and not move for over mins surely something can be done to speed up disembarkation at least
great food on the boat and easy check in at newhaven it would be good and safer if there was a cycle lane coming off the ferry
the trip was a necessity because we were going to a vintage car meeting in helsinge on zealand we enjoyed ourselves with people we knew the service was friendly and competent however the lift capacity is too poor the service on the car deck should not send vintage cars up on the quotshelfquot where the roof height is cm more than the car and the heads of us sitting in it little understanding of a vehicle without a selfstarter
good nice and easy crossing only ticket in dover very slow you need to turn around on the end of the queue people are not prepared i mean ticket passport or any revelant documents so thay dont block the queue or put some signs be prepared with documents i was min by the window some people was up to min what they doing
efficient staff on the ferry and port
sailings were punctual and the bookingin process and loadingunloading were efficient seats were available communications during the passages were good staff were polite and helpful
midnight ferry and on outward journey regular announcements over the tannoy woke everyone up throughout the trip didnt happen on return trip all facilities clean and in working order plenty of space overall an ok experience
arrived at the port and the whole things was so well organised both in the uk and france hassle free helpful staff definitely use dfds again thank you
the trip went well everything correct would do it again in a heartbeat good society one disadvantage be there at least an hour in advance thats quite long and the taxfree offers were quite disappointing
we had to take the boat back earlier because we had booked an apartment at deys heaven in chatham via bookingcom and that apartment was so dirty that we unfortunately canceled our trip earlier but i had to call and it took a while before i got through but then this english employee helped me with a lot of patience and i was able to rebook we were very happy with that and would not have wanted to stay another night in that apartment where there were even rats in the garden
good service both sides uk and france always helping to get next available ferry free of charge if arrive early
didnt know what to expect as it was our first ferry crossing but everything was great entertainment was good food was great and the crew was really nice and helpful cabins are comfortable and clean
i made it there quite early so they rescheduled me one ferry earlier this is unbelievable awesome thank you so much for that left on time no delays just great my only issue with the company is that they just handed me a strap to secure my motorcycle they didnt check whether or not i did it the right way i did nothing happened but at least someone having a look would have been nice what i really want to say is to the people travelling directly were all tired long trips are exhausting i can totally understand that but laying down on to seats to sleep is unnecessary thats why a lot of people have to sit in the staircase please be kind and dont do that were all on this planet together as a community
checkin was smooth and smooth boat was very clean with adequate amenities
great ferry crossings at a reasonable price food very good from the restaurant and again not over priced it was definitely worth booking a cabin even for a dayevening crossing
i needed to change my return ticket because i had mistakenly booked the wrong date i tried to rearrange booking but was kept waitng on the phone for nearly one hour and then was eventually unable to get though the next day when i did finally get through i was told to pay an extra because i had not altered the ticket within hours the operative i spoke with was entirely uninterested in the fact that i was in the middle of immuno and chemptherapy treatment which makes people forgetful and confused i thought the company would review the situation when i got back but after three prompting emails they responded by saying that i should have booked a flexi ticket instead zero sympthy or understanding we will never use dfds again
because we were only able to book late due to circumstances we had to pay approximately double the regular price we discovered this through conversations with fellow passengers during our crossing although we find some price difference acceptable this difference is very extreme
i have just returned home from a crossing with dfds pearl which unfortunately i can only give stars our cabin has worn outdestroyed and you just generally slept very badly in general i think its a shame that the cabins are so dilapidated there was a terrible noise when you slept a hummingshaking sound that kept you awake all night a ferry where the cabins need renovation our experiences at seas are generally ok however we felt very pressed for time to only have the table for hours then it was off the clock again however the service and staff were friendly and courteous we had noted that we had a birthday child with us on the trip years old we were just around div here you could have used an all incl cruise because hold on we spent a lot of money on the various drinks to listen to the same entertainment both evenings oops i remember the time when there was a casino and discotheque it was missed a place to party without small children the best entertainment was a music quiz the same music two days in a row was a bit tiresome check in went quite well however the long queue when you had to leave the ferry was terrifying in the end a big disappointment that you have to pay for wifi it cost us just dkk on top of that it got behind us all and was a significant disappointment not a crossing that we are happy to think back on
this was our th journey with dfds the service onboard was excellent many thanks to the crew i really like the coffee bar area which was new to us last journey was pre covid the only suggestion would be to mark the shuttle bus departure place in amsterdam central station better
fantastic experience fast check in on time departure polite staff and even though our kids are all grown up we were impressed with the staff that came around the ferry offering little gifts for the younger kids the flexible ticket was great as we were able to get an earlier boat at not extra cost
no information about where the connecting bus goes very unpleasant bus staff both to and from the ferry good cabin good food drinks and staff on the boat
hello i was on a motorbike trip in norway had booked a ferry home oslokph on august due to the storm i wanted to rebook and travel home earlier i sent a text and asked if i could rebook but received an answer that it was not possible it was against your booking policy so i drove home to hrby in the storm and skipped the ferry and lost skr hence the low rating for you mr and mrs jan henriksson
everything went smoothly and due to the calm sea we arrived one hour early
it was a bit difficult to find customer service phone number after but customer service was amazing thanks to that guy who solve my wrong ticket l
everything went well we even got an earlier ferry
the entire crossing was very well organised friendly service in all accommodations class in a word henk
flexibility on departure clean ships and friendly staff
expensive internet you dont pay for wifi even in small hotels anymore it should be free there is too far to walk in oslo and kbh to get around to the passenger entrance why is it on the back of the ship too much noise in corridors and neighboring rooms from noisy and screaming children and slamming doors but good food and friendly service which must last for hours it was better with the shorter trip before without frederikshavn
very pleasant uneventful trip dover to dunkirk able to catch earlier ferry no charge take note red funnel ferries staff very pleasant and helpful shame kitchen closed half hour from port kids in play area very noisy great embarking and disembarking team recommend
its my first time driving from uk to france from buying the tickets taking the ferry staying at the cabin the experience is so great the staff are so nice and friendly we would recommend my friends to join the dfds trip in future
ive had great journeys few times by dfds ferries to dieppe and i really enjoyed them each time great service great staff
we often travel to scotland to visit family and always take the dfds ferry from amsterdam to newcastle and back again that really speaks for itself we are very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone
we were informed in good time of the change in schedule due to potential band weather and the crossings in both directions newhavendieppe and return were comfortable and on time however the foot passenger facilities especially at newhaven are really very basic especially the actual boarding process and not welcoming and some staff were not very communicative we got the feeling that this is perhaps apoor relation compared with some of your other routes perhaps this accounts for the very reasonable for a return passage finally your website is rather dominated by promotional material at the expense of addressing passenger queries and one of the phone numbers there for newhaven didnt work and the other was not answered we do think this is basically a good route to access the normandy region and hope this honest feedback is of some use in improving it
traveling with dfds is a pleasant way to travel to scotland good catering and facilities and a nice bed to sleep in
had to cancel at short notice for personal reasons we had to pay the full amount i would have liked a more accommodating approach the lady on the phone was friendly but completely overwhelmed i will not book with dfds in the future update from i stick to my opinion the response from dfds uses paragraphs as an argument absolutely unaccommodating
traveled with two others so we had the opportunity to talk and summarize the joint activity we had in copenhagen
from booking to information about the trip everything was
we choose dfds to get a good start and end to the danish holiday and always have a good experience this time too with the exception of two things we experienced stains on the duvet and in the bed under the bedclothes and spills on the wall the soap dispenser by the sink was broken this was discovered at bedtime and in high seas and we couldnt bring ourselves to say anything until the next day getting a nok voucher that could only be used outside dutyfree and within hours only works if you have the energy or desire to go to the bar in the evening if you shop right before you leave the ship for a holiday trip it is almost worthless unless you could get it updated to the time of your return journey
checkin at both ends was so quick and easy the app is great to remind of times etc we arrived before our ferry was open to check in but they checked us in to the earlier ferry instead which was amazing as they were due to board mins later ferry was clean and staff were pleasant
the flexi tariff was worth the money no stress on the way there or back the check on the way there or back was very good and quick one minus is that i couldnt change euros into pounds and the atm only accepts credit cards best regards reinhard teuber
a crossing from hell children left to run wild around the ferry and scream for the whole crossing staff were useless the only thing they did was to announce to the parents and children to stop doing it but obviously those parents did not care elderly people were having trouble getting about and many complained to the staff but for the entire crossing it was like being in a zoo no rest at all a crossing from hell
dfds takes you from the uk to the netherlands including your car the journey is not very comfortable cabins are spartan beds are poor as if the s never passed your car is guided to a deck somewhere then you have to find where you need to go no information in advance in the email with for example a map of the boat the films that are showing or the evenings menu entertainment is two mediocre live bands and a disgusting chip shop constructive renovate the huts up to date make an effort to find good beds provide good quality food signage and staff communicate with your customer oh and provide more places where you as a traveler can sit without being in a restaurant or bar not everyone has money to eat and drink on board after euro crossing costs with the high prices charged
in my opinion there are many improvements that can be made for pedestrian passengers because the terminal gangway was not working pedestrians had to be the last to board and also the last to disembark on the return journey this could have been communicated much better and above all earlier and above all when they are the first to disembark they walk in peace and without the exhaust fumes present in the hold there were people who still had to travel by train and there were also plenty of collectors waiting in vain it seems like a small thing but i have noticed that it causes a lot of unnecessary stress for many people kudos to the waiting staff the menu the cleanliness of the cabins etc there was absolutely nothing missing sorry about the above problem
always friendly staff and helpful we were unlucky with traffic on the first sailing and then on the second customs in dover took more than an hour to clear which meant we missed the ferry again details were changed at check in and it was no trouble so we just hopped on the later sailing only criticism is that the full english breakfast only had mushrooms and they werent the big type lol
very fast checkin boarding departure and arrival on time very friendly staff food was very good clean ferry
travelled today with dfds from dover to dunkirk it was a really lovely relaxing experience the french police customs at dover were very friendly as were the dfds check in staff they could not have been more helpful on board i paid for the premier lounge which was clean well cared for and staffed by very helpful people well worth the my thanks to all the staff
we had a very good experience on the mini cruise to oslo our first time with dfds overall we are very satisfied with the trip the weather was great no waves which probably also made the experience great however some things one could wish were better the ship clearly bears the stamp of being from an older date we had an interior standard cabin and it was probably in worse condition than expected if we could choose again we would probably have taken a slightly more expensive room as the cabin was very small two separate beds where the man was too long for the bed no ventilation in the bathroom no soap in the container dust on the tables large slobbers on the edge of the bed and forgotten rubbish under the bed the cleaning was nothing to brag about it was very shabby the cabin was located in the corridor close to the bubble zone so there was constant noise from children running and playing in the corridor very noisy as there is air under the door but that is to be expected no tv in the room nor towels to dry hands in only bath towel we were surprised that we had to pay for wifi on the trip ourselves it was very expensive and we probably expected this to be included in the price tax free was very nice and many different things however we didnt buy anything as the prices were not particularly cheap compared to dk very nice restaurants we ate both on seas and on explorer very good experiences with delicious food good quality the breakfast at seas was excellent not the greatest selection and both mornings the softboiled eggs were so raw they were inedible on the ship there were several good bars eg navigator bar we were really pleasantly surprised by live music and very good drinks on board albeit at exorbitant prices it quickly becomes an expensive trip with the high drink prices columbus club very nice but the entertainment both evenings consisted of singers who could not sing in any way it was very fake which was a bit of a tame experience when we arrived in oslo at we had preordered sightseeing through the website when we had to leave the ship we stood in line for minutes in the arrivals hall to get out to our sightseeing bus which was in the papers to run at it caused an enormous amount of stress and frustration for us as we only got out half an hour later than our bus was supposed to leave the company should know that when you can prebook sightseeing that the bus should perhaps run later than a quarter of an hour later luckily for us we still got on the bus as our driver had chosen to wait but he told us when we were driving that passengers had not made it and that it was the same the day before that several of the passengers had not made it i think this should work better when you know in advance that there may be a queue we dont know that when we order from home we were lucky to make it because he was waiting but the stress we had in the arrivals hall was a miserable way to start the only hours in oslo which suddenly turned into only hours the sightseeing trip on the other hand was a really nice trip and a super guide we were both at holmenkollen and vigelands park very nice overall a very nice trip we had with dfds and we were very happy when we got home however some money should be invested in renovating the very worn cabins
it is difficult to get from the cabin and down the stairs to the car deck when you arrive in oslo or copenhagen all passengers stand on deck and want to disembark first otherwise nice sailing trip and nice food
brilliant service for both crossings we made an earlier ferry as it was super efficient the ferrys were clean and staff friendly well definitely always chose to use dfds for future holidays
clean comfortable love the quiet rooms only trouble is long wait to disembark and queue at immigration especially newhaven end crossing seems to take forever on the night ferry
all went really smoothly with the ferry feeling clean and modern and well organised
newhaven crossing is far smaller more laid back than the major ports on the south coast to france happy to use again and again
excellent service plenty of space and efficient loading and disembarking both in dover and dunkirk we were added to the earlier ferry with on early arrival much appreciated
will never use them again the slowest disembarking both in france and in england that i have ever experienced almost hours on french side and when we docked back in newhaven we sat in ours cars with no information for mins with no sign of any movement the hour journey back was horrendous with rampaging children screaming and playing tag across the whole ship despite announcements asking them to stop no staff visible at any time other than canteen staff who knew nothing worst ferry journey i have ever had
we take this ferry several times a year as it is a good option when travelling from scotland to the continent the price has become so high that we are starting to consider driving further south to dover to get a cheaper deal the cabins are becoming quite worn and could use a refit if you are paying these prices you expect to be staying in cabins which are not on their last legs also the toiletshower cubicles smell very strongly of sewage
we have traveled often with dfds the unfortunate thing is that apples mobile devices rarely connect to wifi upon inquiring with customer service it turned out to be an apple issue thats a shame it would be much nicer if that is resolved apart from that the staff is friendly and the trip was enjoyable it was great that we could take an earlier ferry to dunkirk on the way back superb service
we arrived at customs well in time this took so long that we didnt check in at the nut on time this meant we could only leave hours later very annoying
not the first time we have used dfds but this time we needed to get back to the uk at short notice booked online the night before easy to book good price efficient at the port we have used most ferry operators over the years but dfds have been the easiest to deal with to date
the trip was easy breezy our ferry to france was right on time we boarded straight away and enjoyed our way sitting comfortably on a very nice and neat vessel on our way back we got to the port before and we were able to take an earlier boat amazing which was also spotless clean and very comfy overall a very good experience which we would be happy to repeat
what went wrong this time same as many times before amongst first cars to arrive in dieppe so shunted up to level one hour after disembarkation started we were released then mins in passport queue appalling
came home via dunkirk instead of calais really quite and quick checkin this willbe my route from now on
friendly staff clean ferry
this was our first ferry trip from uk to france with the same price as other ferry companies i decided to book dfds as there was a promotion with kids eat free after i purchased the ferry tickets and was unable to make the meal booking the staff told me that this had to be made during buying the tickets they had no way to redeem it on board however i could not find this option when i bought the ticket this disappointed us in addition there was an one hour delay in our return to uk while the other ferry companies were on time i would choose another company next time
all in all we enjoyed the trip with dfds however the late departure times and the resulting very late dinner with two small children years and year are rather bad when we left kiel we liked the fact that we were given priority on the ship with two small children unfortunately this was not the case on the return journey from klaipeda despite having a trailer in the car it was great that we were given an extra bed without any problems on both trips when it came to food especially lunch and dinner we would have liked to see a larger selection for children for example pasta with tomato sauce fish fingers or other typical childrens dishes on the return journey from lithuania the communication on arrival in kiel was great we were informed about how long it would be until we could get to the car
the dfds cruise to and from ijmuiden to newcastle was great to newcastle we booked the commodore suite which was absolutely great the way back we had an outside cabin which was basic but okay unfortunately we had loud neighbours so difficult to sleep
takes too long getting off the boat but apart from that we have what we need while on the boat
loading team are excellent as we had motorcycles cabin was clean and tidy only towel in a birth seems odd immigration was rude and clearly not interested in his job getting out of the port in both directions is deplorably tedious and slow while the staff in the cabins checking passports clearly not interested
parking before i got on ferry was good ferry cleanstaff helpful food good
really enjoyed newhaven to dieppe route a nice change from the hustle and bustle of dover to calais came back on the overnight ferry and hired a cabin which was fun good value
reliable ferry fast and friendly service and flexible booking
the ticket ladies need to have more control when they print out key cards for cabins names were mixed up because we were couples with only surnames and the safety is absolutely minus on the wagon tyre mail has been sent with photo
after we queued hours to get into dover port we missed our booked ferry it was so great we were just booked on the next one without any discussion and every staff was very friendly thanks a lot
crossing from ijmuiden to newcastle and back with an organized trip for holiday to ireland with the dfds very friendly and helpful staff on board who will help you quickly find the cabin upon arrival only the ship itself what an old boat that is outdated these days along the way we stood on deck and another traveler drew our attention to an enormous cloud in the distance behind the ship that lingered with all kinds of harmful substances that could be blown into the air hardly able to sleep at night due to the drone and engine noise we had booked an outside hut with a surcharge but in the hut itself you have nothing except a small disaster not even a television or refrigerator the food in the restaurants was fine but not very warm on the outward journey probably due to a previous power failure dfds will have to make significant investments in the coming years to continue to meet todays expectations and requirements
never again we traveled from klaipeda to kiel our nerves were already frayed at checkin it took forever the ferry was overcrowded unfortunately we couldnt get a cabin sleep was out of the question all night access to the recliners was blocked off by a slamming door there were a total of toilets per gender breakfast didnt open until am this meant that there was such a big queue that we had to wait minutes we paid more for the crossing than with tt line where we had a cabin
i bought my ticket and canceled days before trip funny is that you can cancel your booking but you cant get any refund so they can let another person buy ticket to earn more money but dont let you to have refund why that option cancel is available if you can get anything ridiculous ill make sure to not operate with them in the future
good safe crossings well organized very friendly staff cabins in commodore class are clean but worn and could use a renovation on the king seaways
overall pretty good the only slight criticism is of not being informed of the reason for the ferry being delayed
a terrible experience on the outward journey we paid euros for a sea view cabin for the of us we were on deck in cabin and all night we were in the drone and rattle of the machines and the beds above us also creaked not a wink of sleep actually they shouldnt offer these cabins we also found the drinks on board very expensive note we were compensated satisfactorily
my sons could not get the breakfast we thought we had ordered for them on the oslo ferry it turns out that dfds booking system which is probably the only one in the world requires that you order breakfast on a different date than you are supposed to have it no one on the actual tour was willing to do anything despite it being a buffet and customer service was pretty much just as rigid so never ever again its just too weird customer service update i had of course tried to contact the mentioned email that part of dfds is just as unwelcoming as the staff on the ship so its probably a company culture i got the message that they will talk to their marketing department about making the booking process more transparent but that it would not change the decision that you do not refund anything after the sailing i pointed out that we already objected to the complaint email during the process i dont know if that resonates id say it just keeps getting worse and worse
this was so much more than a ferry transfer more like a mini cruise with lots of eating options and entertainment wed planning another trip already
this was my second trip with dfds and it was not great the smoking area was closed off due to windy conditions but i believe the wind was not that strong hi understand it is for the health and safety of travelers but i think asking people to be extra cautious rather than forbidding them to use the smoking are would be better also as the boat was docking i was refused to use the restroom which was not very convenient keeping in mind we had to wait for about min to get off the boat
i was travelling by cycle along with other cyclist unfortunately it was raining and we had to stand out in the queue of cars waiting for customs and ticket checkthis was for almost an hour i realise with brexit this will take longer than previously but is there any way of doing this under cover it happened on the return journey too
dont travel with these reards we go with people me my wife daughter and grandmom they tell us to go to border security and are afraid that the grandmom will go work in england she is been waiting for hours now for them to finish questioning what the actual fck do you needto ask a person for hours straight and if you ask what is going on they tell you its gonna be minutes hours later of asking what is gonna heapen and we are still waiting they told us for hours that she is finished questioning but still wont let her go so we can go back home last time ever i use this agency to travel better go eurotunnel
i have travelled with dfds and norfolkline before that across the channel for dozens of times they have never let me down and have always been helpful when i needed something changed in a booking or on board when whilst crossing even though i could always find something that wasnt perfect if i would want to moan but that would not do dfds justice i heartily recommend dfds for cross channel ferries
ferry left almost an hour late on the return journey toilets not clean
i kindly recommend to use dfds as a cruise line the staff was so kind and the service was too good overall it was all good
due to the congested port of dover we were late for our boat we were immediately offered two alternatives calais pm dunkirk pm
outstanding and professional service travelling with three young children its always a challenge but during our journey with dfds everything went very smoothly magdalena staff member was very helpful in particular
ferry was on time both ways and the premium lounge was as good as always staff friendly and attentive as well altogether just what you would want
overdue and not up to date we sailed weeks ago with stena line and everything here was a positive surprise everything from the bedroom to the bathroom to the duvets to the quality was better than expected its a completely different story now at dfds from new castle and i wish i could say something else as it is my family that started dfds many years ago and i would much rather be able to praise but unfortunately actually the experience applies to the whole ferry but in particular the cabin stuffy with poor ventilation where the walls in the bathroom are falling down everything in the room gets wet from a shower and both the bathroom and bedroom cannot be properly vented for moisture so the one small towel you are allocated cannot reach to dry for a shower in the morning hour journey or just to dry hands afterwards the shower curtain is dirty the toilet does not flush properly and you can choose between hot or cold water in the bath they have managed to make the m bedroom sound like a swimming pool and there is a lack of storagehanging space i could actually go on noise from ventilation the plastic sheet on the bed etc and then they still charge a fortune to get online on the trip which nowadays should probably be part of the package for everyone there is a long way to go before i choose dfds the next time i travel overseas
approaching the ferry in oslo was very confusing but we found our way checkin was efficient and good the cabins were ready late compared to the checkin time so it is an annoyance excellent buffet i would especially recommend the breakfast buffet when we had to go down to the car on arrival the stairs were completely blocked by waiting passengers who were not going down to the car deck again an annoyance that should be able to be arranged better the cabin was a standard interior and we were very satisfied with it all in all a nice and enjoyable trip nb no internet was excellent it was good to have some time to be social read a good book etc
amazingly friendly staff everything on board always so clean and tidy travel often with dfds and we have never had any complaints without any doubt we will continue to travel with dfds in the future
long waiting times at the checkin counter delayed start of the ferry generally a clean ferry and friendly staff
everything was smooth friendly and efficient except boat was delayed minutes which was never communicated or explained
easy throughout easy booking easy at port and we travelled with a dog
pleasant ferry crossing boarding and checkin smooth unfortunately the cleanliness and functionality of the toilets left a lot to be desired
we have already travelled with dfds from dunkerque calais and dieppe as well as ijmuiden to the uk many times checkin is always flawless quick and friendly embarkation has always been on time the ferries are generally clean as are the cabins the food on board is just like the onboard restaurants we prefer to bring our own sandwiches and only have drinks there
overall very good only the long waiting times at checkin in dover are very annoying at the french border control in dover the waiting time on was barely minutes more than minutes at the dfds checkin that should be possible faster
we travel with a dog and are therefore very happy that dfds offers dog cabins it is also easy to ventilate the dog in a designated area on the deck
ferry loaded very late no information on twitter or on lcd screen at dunkirk arrived late at dover as a result sort out your comms please
arrived hours and minutes early to the port dfds check in was so slow over hours that it made me miss the ferry i was booked on this is ridiculous when the guidance dfds give is to turn up to the port hours early which i turned up earlier than customer services arguing this is my fault yet there guidance is contradicting i also paid more to be boarded with the trucks with there low carsports car option which they ignored and put me on with regular traffic edit dfds will not refund me for the low carsports car boarding option even though i didnt receive it absolute joke of a company
unfortunately it was not clear to me that you can book a dogfriendly cabin if you are travelling with a dog as this was not offered to me for a family of five dogfriendly is only available for after checking in in amsterdam we were greeted immediately after disembarking and one of us was supposed to follow a lady with the dog our dog had to stay in a small cage in an airconditioned dimly lit room i could ask about visiting times and they would take care of it the staff were really very nice and said that they would not accommodate their dog here either and luckily i was able to rebook on the ship my suggestion to the ferry company to please clarify on their website what is hidden behind the transport box and that in my opinion this no longer fits in with the time was dismissed with the comment that the transport had been approved by a vet i would therefore like to make dog owners aware of the need to book a dogfriendly cabin if they do not want their dog to have to sit alone in a small cage for hours you can take him outside to a very small area as they were unable to offer me a dogfriendly cabin for the return journey due to a lack of capacity until departure this was something that kept coming up for me during our vacation
to customer service in dfds it was about years ago that we traveled with you a trip where most things went wrong since then we have only traveled with colorlineno on we thought we would try dfds again with children and grandchildren and to the fairground in copenhagen we had asked for cabins as close as possible but ended up on different floors we fully understand this as the bookings are not made at the same time we approached reception to get a childcare entry and driving pass to the fairground we had also ordered a voucher of nok each way the babysitters worked well but had to return to get playing tokens we had also paid for dinner and breakfast both ways as well as the bus to the funfair dinner was booked at the seven seas restaurant but it was closed for a closed event no information that the dinner buffet had been moved this was something we had to find out on our own the disappointment was even greater when we saw how small the dessert table was and not the soft ice cream that the children had been talking about all day we paid for drinks and went into tax free to shop we got to the till and then it turned out that the restaurant had used up the money on the voucher without informing us we had paid for the dinner buffet in advance new queue at reception with two tired children where we learned that the restaurant had deducted the money even though dinner had been prepaid two nice men at reception cleaned this up good job from them the next day when we were going ashore in copenhagen luckily we checked entrance tickets and driving passes to the funfair we only had of each full speed up at reception they sorted things out and we disembarked with entry tickets and driving passes back on the boat later in the day we were to pick up the childrens passports we were told that we had not paid for the journey home which we had done reception arranged again the day before departure to oslo we were told that it was the copenhagen marathon so the bus did not leave from the terminal you must have known this for a long time without informing about it we were told by a nice man at the reception that it was best to take the train subway to the fair we did that round trip in total we spent about nok on the trip and we had ordered commodore class cabins if we and our grandchildren could sleep in the same cabin so much went wrong we are unsure if we will take chances on more trips with dfds despite many free tickets from tax free we expect money back for the bus round trip dfds centre for people sincerely anita kongshaug
ferry was on time had a good comfortable crossing
we were at the checkin in dunkirk a good two hours before our pm departure and were able to quickly board the pm ferry
clean boat nice new furniture fast departure we were allowed to take a boat earlier free of charge simply great
i have booked a trip to oslo tomorrow in a suite unfortunately i got really sick today and asked to rebook you cant do that in this miserable company the cancellation fee is it is simply worse than ryan air which is the worlds worst airline i would encourage everyone to stay far away from this company personally i would rather take a pedalo to oslo
we felt that everything was intended for baltic travelers however the swedish customer service was at the highest level
checkin staff were pleasant and efficient crossings were on time and the embarkation was trouble free well done dfds staff definitely will be travelling again with you
there was nothing wrong with the basics booking had been simple enough or so i thought the vessel was clean but i would need a good reason to use this company again on arrival at dieppe i was informed that my fellow passenger hadnt been added to the booking i had the email confirmation but the system required me to lose my place in the queue to go to the port office i was one of the last to board and consequently the last vehicle to leave the vessel at newhaven whilst on board i was disappointed to find that for the second time outbound was the same the restaurant was closed for the crossing part of the experience for me is a relaxing hour having a decent meal it is also part of dfds information literature to tempt you onto the ferry there is no mention of it only being available on selected crossings the alternative was a far from desirable meal in the cafeteria which was badly prepared and overpriced the washrooms were fresh clean but in the gents every single cubicle door was either devoid of a lock or the lock had been forced and was now defective draw your own conclusions on that having travelled on ferries to france and spain on numerous occasions i think this company has some catching up to do on their competitors
at the request of dfds we arrived early for checkin we stood in the queue for hours because quotlarge cars always have to go lastquot upon return our line was again the last to be taken off the boat waiting in the hold in front of running cars headache from the exhaust fumes whoever checked in last was allowed out first so more than hours in a stationary car with children not recommended spacious cabin hard beds no possibility to book a restaurant in advance despite early booking
everything went smoothly on the way back we were too early and at the request of dfs we were able to book an earlier crossing this was also handled well administratively
very easy boarding of our car clear signs and infos where to find what on the boat very friendly staff
tiny cabin the staff took their smoke breaks in front of our window and they also sat in our window prices in the restaurants were completely inflated the duty free shop was more expensive than in shops advertised as less wifi is free with other ferry companies but here it was over euros for hours no tv in the cabin when we left fredrikshafen we were stopped and mistaken for someone who had apparently committed a crime on the ferry even though the description didnt fit at all sorry not at all next time well book with tt line again
excellent prompt service with great on board facilities and food plenty of quiet spaces for tired trippers great value and avoids all the problems with ports such as dover
the people on the ferries are so nice checking in etc also goes very smoothly prices for the meals are not too crazy and the food is good all in all a very nice experience again
very helpful staff whenever i rang them up to discussamend my booking staff members were always very polite and helpful in particular rebecca was very helpful when assisting me with my latest booking also the service provided onboard of the vessel is very good highly recommended
good return trip dover to dunkirk cheaper and more comfortable than the tunnel had a decent reasonably priced meal duty free shopping ferry gives a good break after driving miles with another miles to go on the other side booking easy completing traveller info easy will use dfds ferry again
following an unpleasant experience caused by serious noise pollution as a result of a private party during a night crossing from newcastle to ijmuiden a complaint was filed with dfds they took the complaint seriously and responded quickly the complaint has been resolved to your complete satisfaction
newhavendieppe is a convenient route for where we live and often where were travelling to on the continent so is always a route we look at first nothwithstanding this the pricing for crossings particularly on our return trip had significantly increased since last year and we thought very hard about using less convenient routes from dover requiring additional time and mileage on both sides of the channel but with significantly cheaper fares before booking newhavendieppe however this was exacerbated by additional charges for changing our return crossing to th july from th for various reasons we arrived in dieppe from our holiday in time to switch to the pm departure on sat th from the booked pm one on th we were charged just over extra for this a price we decided to pay as we were saving on a hotel bill we had been anticipating to pay for an overnight stay near dieppe on th i would estimate the seven sisters ferry appeared to be about three quarters full with vehicles on departure next day so room was not at a premium and the process to switch took only a minute visit to your dieppe office on top of the high initial cost theres no question that this additional cost was vastly inflated for what was provided it only made economic sense to us to make the change due to savings elsewhere had we being looking to change sailings on the same day we would not have paid the extra other routes the tunnel and p o at dover for example offer no charge at all to take a different time crossing to that booked if space is available on adjacently timed crossings the hour crossing on th was very rough which is not what you would expect on a sunny day in july which is what it was and obviously not dfdss fault the ships crew did extremely well to bring the ferry in on time to newhaven and particularly to berth it in a gale force wind ive spent much longer on ferries berthing in dover but the time taken to disembark after such an experience was too long followed by an appalling long wait for uk passport control passport control is again outside dfds control but as a traveller the overall process added over an hour to the berthing time and more cooperation between the two authorities is required to speed things up border control opened up a rd lane for passport checks two thirds of the way through the overall process to clear all vehicles why so late they could hardly have been unaware of the ferrys arrival and in any event a rd lane wasnt enough to begin with
we sailed on the overnight newcastleamsterdam service and had been lucky enough to get a person cabin right at the front of the ship with an excellent view of the bow however as predicted by the met office shipping forecast the weather was very stormy particularly during the night the friendly guest services member of staff gave us a second inside cabin for free where the effects of the storm would be less which helped us get back to sleep allinall the service was welcoming friendly helpful the food was nice but because of the weather we didnt use any of the entertainment facilities a couple of issues with the dfds website neither me nor a customer services person at dfdsfr were able to prebook our seats on the bus transfer from newcastle station to the ferry port we bought them from the driver when we updated our reservation to give the passengers details although we selected uk as the nationality for our kids their nationality was recorded as being belgian so we had to reenter all their passport info again apart from the weather and those minor glitches with its website it was a good service and one wed use again if the kids can be persuaded that the bad weather was a oneoff
we had booked incorrectly it was our mistake our anxious spanish dog would have had to stay in a cage for hours which was out of the question one phone call and despite the ferry being fully booked it was possible for us our camper van and the dog to have space with us excellent customer service
large modern clean boat sailed on time good valeu fare announcements to return to car deck on arrival at dover not so good inaudible huge numbers of school children car driver and heir passenger should have ben told to go down first consequently we were late to our car at the from of a line and it delayed the disembarkation also large coaches were moving out fast as car passengers were trying to cross deck lanes to get to their cars not really safe
we have won a free cabin for up to people in the same cabin writes dfds when we then go to book the trip we can see that we only get a dkk discount on the cheapest cabin when we call to find out how that can be their answer is quotyou get more discount the more upgrades you choosequot they have written themselves that you have won a free cabin but you havent you have won a dkk discount so write it as it is instead
check in was chaotic lanes into lanes into then vack to for metres then vack into again ferry delayed departure no explanation ferry also late even after allowing for late departure again no explanation departure terminal was shabby toilets smelt disgusting
after being very satisfied with dfds amsterdam newcastle last year cabin dinner top notch we were delighted this year to come across the new rosslare dunkirk route by chance with dfds however this route is obviously so new to the offer that it is neither advertised nor can you find any information about the ship cabin furnishings bars restaurant we therefore based our decision on the cabin descriptions of the other dfds ships and because of the long crossing hours we decided to treat ourselves to a commodore de luxe cabin we assumed that the services would at least be similar to the cabin types of the same name on other dfds ships what a disappointment when we were finally able to enter our cabin after hours of checkin chaos and discovered that it was just a slightly larger cabin with a double bed but no seating area where we actually wanted to make ourselves comfortable for the many hours just a small slanted window but you could only look out of it while standing because it was so high there was only a reading lamp above one bed the reading lamp above the other bed had been removed and you couldnt even operate the light switches we were not granted access to the commodore lounge which was mentioned in the other ship descriptions because there was no commodore lounge on board the whole ship is very simply equipped and you can tell that the focus is on the freight business accordingly it is a ferry and not as is often the case a quotmini cruisequot we dont really care about that or we even prefer the simpler version but we shouldnt raise expectations in advance that are not fulfilled in any way and above all the prices should be reasonable we paid eur for this oneway trip with a camper van and people in our quotluxury cabinquot a more than proud price that we would definitely not pay to dfds again the food which was included in the price was of canteen quality but it was filling however the friendliness of the staff with the exception of the friendly man at reception left a lot to be desired one had the impression that the working atmosphere on board was not good our conclusion with realistic expectations based on accurate descriptions and at a significantly cheaper price we would book the ferry again but you have to be clear its just a ferry
nice trip with the family that didnt cost us a lot of money friendly staff excellent cabins the only minus was the sailing but dfds cannot be blamed for that
very easy crossing had everything we needed
friendly and helpfull staff at land and sea nice boats with good facilities almost on time
garage staff parked an enormous lorry up against the access door to the stairway it was dirty and walking with the aid of a stick made it very difficult to pass the entry key to the cabin did not work staff tried unsuccessfully to open door as well on two occasions before finally getting one key to work we did not have the confidence to leave the dabin as we were unsure whether we would be able to reenter
everything went as it should in oslo the problems occurred on the way home i had i think come to choose the month of august rather than the month of july when booking the return journey probably because the two months stand next to each other when choosing an outbound and return journey ie became discovering this just before departure on i am told that there are no seats for the departure but that i can come by boat the following day i choose this in the first place not least because i am very stressed about the situation after i have recovered a bit i find out that i can come home by bus and train on i therefore call dfds customer service to find out if i can cancel my journey home i can not i explain that i am on my way home by bus and train calling as i am waiting for the bus to gothenburg and that i therefore cannot use the booking on i therefore ask to keep the original homeward booking which is on not least because i do not want dfds to make money from my wrong booking i also say this to customer service to my great surprise i discover the day after that the booking has not been adjusted back to i am therefore contacting dfds customer service again now by email it is the same person who answers emails that i now write with he claims that i have not been clear enough regarding the fact that the booking home had to be changed from to and that therefore no change has been made to the booking no matter what i write dfds maintains that i no longer have a ticket for what a bad customer service though the treatment i have received from dfds customer service in no way makes me want to travel with them again ps you get to oslo faster by bustrain than by the oslo ferry food is cheaper to buy at the stations and transport is less harmful to the climate than the ferry
minutes late setting off then ages to get into ports docking bay with no explanation the reasons
the crossing from dunkirk to dover was as always a pleasure courteous friendly and on the other side of the english channel in no time i would do it again any time and have done so for years even by phone very friendly highly professional and courteous i can only give stars but they actually deserve
registered vehicle as large private van as moving personal goods to new home in france not one hint that i might need a freight booking or gmd or a t latter not needed this time due to value of goods hours of endless fun at dover finding my govt gateway id then an eori and finally a gmd just to get out of the country staff in office were very helpful in changing booking and getting me on next available sailing
service was on time although i arrived late i was given my priority boarding and was rushed through premier lounge was full but there was plenty of room and good service i am looking forward to using dfds again
premium phone calls just to buy tickets and services from dfds after waiting on line the calls costs me more than the ferry get a life dfds give us an number like the other ferry companies ferries are fine but im not using you until you sort out the phones i got a nice answer to this with a local phone number i booked my multiticket smoothly and quickly its transformed my rating from star to star thank you martin and thank you dfds
ticket booking and app are straightforward ferry boarding was well organised vessel departed on time and was clean well provisioned with different restaurants etc dunkirk ferry terminal is pretty basic however less time anyone spends there the better
the ferry was fine my real concern is your staff saftey the fumes they have to breathe with no masks on the car decks is horrendous breakfast and meals way over priced
have used dfds several times from dunkirk to dover and return always goes well friendly staff we were even able to join an earlier boat once when we were early next time just dfds for us
sailed on time well organised would have liked a comfy chair for the journey but busy crossing and non available
checkin in dover could have been a little faster
horrible customer service plan to travel with a pet dont
everything was fine except for the signage to the port in paldiski it is a disaster and there were many who complained at checkin in the queue why is it only signposted kapellskr to tallinkbten riduculous
the crossing is well organised the prices on board could be a little lower after an expensive crossing
very competitive pricing the service from newhaven was easy to access and got us to our destination on time
the family and i had a mini cruise with pearl here the other day which was a mixed experience with a single highlight for both us and the kids it started a bit chaotic with our cabins not being ready when we got on board so we sat down in the bubble zone and were greeted by a very smiling and happy man who was both service minded and could joke with both us adults and children it was very liberating because when we got on board we didnt feel that we were being spoken to very nicely throughout both days we repeatedly descended into the bubblezone and every single time he was ready with a smile and good service no matter how many people or how loud the noise was he radiated joy and good energy which really rubbed off on us anyway and hopefully others too from our side it will be a huge thank you to patrick who made the trip much more fun for us and yes that our children wanted to come back to the bubblezone on the whole trip
as a commodore guest with a car you do not have to be directed up to the hanging deck you must stay at the front of the ship so that you are the first to disembark it cant be that difficult to let commodore guests by car wait to board until the hanging deck is full after all we have a large sign in the windscreen saying that we are commodore guests in doing so you fulfill the advantage of us getting off the board first
nothing to complain about on both the outward and return journey from dunkirk to dover we were at the port too early no problem at all to take a boat earlier it was simply offered getting in and out of ships went smoothly also fine on board plenty of seats we would immediately book with dfds again
trips with dfds in days both very pleasant late night dover to dunkirk ferry with premium lounge access lounge very comfy with snacks and drinks all available welcomed with offer of a glass of wine or presecco efficient service then overnight ferry from kiel to klapedia older ferry food ok and staff in restaurant efficient but not polite cabin comfy although horrible to not be able to flush toilet paper car loading and unloading took a long time as they squeeze a lot of cars in not a trip for a nervous driver
fun experience to sail to oslo economy cabins are small but nice and clean only thing dfds needs to update is power outlets there are not enough in public areas and in a time where people need power all the time well
yesterdays sailing july ijmuiden to newcastle was very busy we had to park our car in such a narrow space on the th car deck that we hardly could get out of the car the bathroom in our cabin was very dated with a basin which was chipped after being called to go to deck we all persons with a car with exit door had to wait appr min plus until we could get through door we all experienced difficulties in getting to and in our cars as they were parked too cramped the ferry between ijmuiden and newcastle and vice versa is quite expensive the quality price ratio is below reasonable expectations
we travelled from new haven to dieppe and had a hassle free journey both waysits very good value for tickets and on the ferry the staff from entering the port to departing were helpful and friendly i would highly recommend
the boat was clean the staff friendly and welcoming the boat sailed and arrived on time my only criticism is that between being allowed onto the car deck and being allowed off the boat there is not enough time for everyone to get to there cars
we arrived early and was offerd an early ferry pleasant staff and ship was clean
we were able to take an earlier ferry without any problem staff very friendly
the check in was very easy as we arrived very early we could take an earlier ferry without any hassel
i think the customer service is not up to par you are here to serve your customers we want to go on the trip that we booked for th july our kids were super excited about it but then we get a surprise visit from my niece who is just years old we want to add her to the trip since we cannot just leave her here but there is no way to do it which in my opinion comes from lack of empathy there is room in the huts since we r seven and the huts are people to compensate we even cancelled my older sons ticket but now the problem is that he is an adult and we cant change from adult to child i dont understand this if you are genuine to your customers you will try to serve them and find solutions not create more problems as it turns out our relatives in oslo had planned a surprise trip back with us to copenhagen so that was also ruined our whole trip ruined just because the backend doesnt support a business logic of transferring names between adult and child how totally unsatisfactory
some slightly older but still lovely ships i really like the large deck area and the large living areas on board the staff is top professional and friendly however i have two things that drag me down a bit the cabins could use a renovation as they are although very clean so clearly marked by age on pearl seaways changing is unisex and it is difficult to change without being hassled there are some small cabins but you almost have to carry your clothes in a bag there are some similar problems when getting in and out of the shower for me its no problem i chose to be naked which was painless but for others it could easily become a big problem and result in them choosing not to take a shower and oh well ill never get used to calling the ships pearl seaways and crown seaways for me as an old dfds member the name change is almost an insult to majesty
we paid for priority boarding i would not waste my money next time as the ferry was nowhere near full and made virtually no difference if the priority status started at the customs checks it would be better as we got stuck in queues for customs the other queues were flying through or cars to every in our queues also very disappointing was absolutely no choice for vegetarians we planned to have lunch on the crossing the only offering for us was a morrocon tagine which we do not like curry and fish and chips for everyone else why not make a vegetable curry we were then sent off to the next floor to get a pizza as an alternative when we got up arrived there was no pizza available only drinks and cakes otherwise the crossing itself was perfect plenty of seating areas
one ferry was cancelled and we had to wait days after some paperwork dfds covered the costs the staff on the ferry are very friendly and helpful the cabins are clean there is a lot on offer for passengers the food is very good and freshly prepared
i had the best trip on ms crown seaways on july and there was a good atmosphere on board pleasant crew who help if there was anything and there was very good service on my trip this year also great service on my previous trips with both ms crown seaways and ms pearl seaways there is good food and drink on board too d the coffee is also very good i was really lucky to meet the captain and chief mate up on the bridge aboard ms crown seaways on this trip of mine pleasant ship drivers of many who get the shipships safely between oslofrederikshavncopenhagen i was like a small child again up on the bridge d i also got good help from miriam on instagram with chat and questions and i got nice answers back again nice lady d i also got great help at the reception on board ms crown seaways on this trip and previous times on both ms crown seaways and ms pearl seaways i hope to travel with dfds again tobias
hei i will just start this by saying our experience with dfds was very bad the things that made this trip horrible was that a employe named kevin barged in to are rom when me my baby and wife was sleeping he didnt even say sorry and i felt it was intentionally because he also said some unkind things to my wife earlier on the trip the second thing that was very bad was that we got scammed when we where eating in the buffet are waitress was a young guy with light brown hair he asked have old our daughter was we told him she is months and he confirmed that she will eat for free because its free for the buffet until years when we was gonna pay the bill we ask again is this the price for only two adults and the waitress said yes it turns out he lied to us and put the price for are baby to on the bill that was almost dk this two incidents alone are very bad and completely unacceptable we as guests investing are time and money on your boat and for us then to be harassed and scammed is completely unacceptable ps other revives online says that they got scammed on your restaurant to
i have sailed with dfds on many occasions over the course of more than years this time was just as good as always the cabin and bathroom were clean maintenance is always good and the crew are smiling and helpful our italian meal on board was excellent as well altogether a very pleasant experience
wonderful staff and excellent ship only complain was the queue or lack of it upon boarding the shuttle from newcastle to north shields
the trip home was ok but the trip up was not ok as our cabin was above a disco and we had paid full price for it and were told that normally you were told this when you ordered it so therefore we expect to receive compensation for our trip on august dear elsebeth and flemming maack
when i booked it turned out that i was only included as a passenger and not my wife i find this striking because i have had an account for many years have booked a lot with dfds and we have always gone together then you would expect that we would both be entered as standard on the other hand i should have checked better and i take responsibility for not doing that well enough i had booked via the cashback site shopbuddies and it turned out that it was linked to an englishlanguage site action by dfds contact their partner shopbuddies and arrange that it always goes to the dutch site maybe it is due to the settings of my laptop and then i want feedback from that and yet i still find it illogical if that is the case i thought i could add my wife quickly and that wasnt the case it doesnt matter for the price its bad that you cant correct something like that right away i think this will happen regularly when i read the text on the website i thought it could be possible and that was very disappointing because that is not possible why not complaint about communication options chat not working such a large company and then no working chat because i dont want to pay high telephone costs i sent an email and then i received the following text quotthank you for your email to dfds the reference number for this email is we will try to working days to get back to the emailquot gtwithin days as an it professional i find it very unprofessional and expect to be contacted quickly to resolve it with friendly ewtpwgye my hashtag greetings ing theo brouwers
good customer service great cabin parked near a lift made our life soo much easier also nice food and staff loaning me an electric charger for my phone definitely use dads again knocked brittany ferries out of the water
terribly bad customer experience it is extremely difficult to book and reserve a ticket for me it was completely impossible no help along the way i have tried to book a single and tried a return nothing can be changed nothing confirmed and no help or explanation as to why it doesnt work you are never told why you dont get ahead and when you then read that it costs dkk to call customer service you have the whole explanation naive belief that we can make more money from telephone service unreliability at a high level and dfds has thus and finally made its choice to lose customers dfds has a lot to learn here if the goal is to keep customers and not just gift all guests to colorline and others to norway try checking the websites of stena molslinjen colorline or lsfrgen here are shipping companies that have checked how to do things in its a shame for the good reputation that such a fine old company has and its a shame to be in such a bad mood because of a feeling of having wasted time because dfds hopes to earn dkk more on my ticket the experience of lack of efficiency is reminiscent of what you experience in the public system really hope someone takes action here its about time the competitors got some competition
the fare was reasonable the ship was on time loading and unloading was fairly fast
really good experience clean cabin smooth crossing welcoming efficient staff the only negative was slow disembarkation in dieppe as the cars rolled off the ferry i think the immigration guys had only just turned up for work waited mins for them to start checking passports fortunately we were one of the first off would have been a long wait for those at the back f the queue
we received a message that the boat was not going due to circumstances that can happen call us and there will be no one available on saturday and sunday also no number to call ultimately resolved but this could be improved
on the way you cancelled the pm boat so lots of people on the pm included busses of children reel chaos returning was much better
foot passenger loads of people on the trip to uk so got on first and got off first return trip many fewer people so on last but helped me because of kate train and train strikes the staff are nice and the bar is fine the food isnt good a notice in the bar area says its only for food bought on the boat but quality of onboard food is poor prices are in sterling but the boat operates in euros so they set the exchange rate regardless be honest and set the boat price in the same currency as the credit card machines timing of ferries seems weird to me you get royally ripped off if you have to change your booking for any reason no refunds and exhorbitant prices if you make a change
oslocopenhagen had the commandore cabin and it was great the food was also very good but difficult to find information about when the various places on the ferry opened or closed nor any easily accessible information about when we had to be back on board mini cruise and the socalled arcade contained machines two of which did not work so nothing special to come up with for the teenager who was there
missed the booked sailing from dunkirk due to heavy traffic no problems with rebooking was kindly offered the next sailing from calais instead of dunkirk which saved us over two hours very friendly and helpful staff everywhere and on top a great experience in the premium lounge very relaxing and well worth the money well definitely travel with dfds again
ill give them a because the outbound journey from dover to dunkirk wasnt too bad the return however wasnt the best for some reason they believe we all drive cars from the s so packed us all in like sardines no doubt ill be going back to a car with dents in because i couldnt even get out of the car and im hardly a typical fatty i may need to reconsider who i travel with and go po since my trip id like to add that the wifi was more scifi and i think the people in dinghies were getting a better service
at first we were very positive we were at checkin more than hours in advance because the website app and email all indicated different checkin closing times that was very unclear tip to update all this so that information coordinated and we were asked if we wanted a boat earlier this also worked so we left enthusiastically it turned out that a freight ship with sea containers was allowed to enter the port of dunkirk first for which we had to wait so the boat was delayed by hours little communication on the boat about this only one report of a halfhour delay when we were finally able to get off the boat unloading took a long time and then we had to wait in a long line for customs dfds cant do anything about it but it is very annoying
the flexible handling of the booking upon arrival at the port is great the first time we missed the boat due to accidents on the highway we arrived too early on the return trip and were able to catch a boat earlier the staff on shore and on board are super friendly in short we will be doing this much more often
i booked a trip to oslo from denmark and back in january we are leaving on i then ordered a condore room and i found out yesterday that there was an error in the booking on the dfds side we got the wrong room i call them but they dont think they can do anything neither give me money back nor book the right room we paid for its just not right therefore only star from here i booked a trip to oslo from denmark and back in january we are leaving on i then ordered a condore room and i found out yesterday that there was an error in the booking on the dfds side we got the wrong room i call them but they dont think they can do anything neither give me money back nor book the right room we paid for its just not right therefore only star from here
it was very hot on the journey from dover to calais the dog had to stay alone down by the cars over degrees not animalfriendly on the outward journey we took the pampo ferry and there was a special dog room with drinks very friendly staff never again with the dfds ferry
the actual crossing was fine we were fortunate to get a decent seat as a lot of people seemed to be struggling to find somewhere to sit services were fine and even though the shop is small it is well stocked unfortunately the disembarkation was horrendous as we were parked on the top floor it took mins before we were allowed to come down in that time the fumes from other vehicles was unbearable especially as there were lots of classic cars on board causing the fumes to be worse many people were getting agitated and my wife was feeling sick and choking after this we had to queue again for passport control our passports had already been checked twice before we boarded ridiculous unfortunately i will be looking at alternative crossings next time
we crossed the channel from dieppe to newhaven using the older persons discount scheme offered by dfds check in at dieppe was simple and painless in part due to the smaller size of the terminal the crossing itself was uneventful and thankfully smooth the cafe prices were quite expensive in our view although the bar prices seemed better docking and disembarking at newhaven seemed to take longer than necessary and the road surface in and around the terminal and port was very uneven on balance we would be happy to use this crossing again so are happy to recommend
because we were a bit early we were able to take a ferry earlier which was very positive it was a pity that the crossing then took an hour longer but all in all it was a very positive experience driving up checking in and parking on the boat are all positive
the outward trip from newhaven to dieppe was good the boat left on time and arrived hours later in dieppe where disembarkation took place efficiently the return trip from dieppe to newhaven was terrible it was due to leave at pm but actually left early at about ie english time it travelled so slowly arriving at taking hours mins to do the crossing question why does it take nearly longer to get back i deliberately arrived early at dieppe so as to be one of the first on and consequently one of the first off as i am years old and am concerned about driving late at night we were asked to go to our car for disembarkation at minutes after arriving i then sat in my car for a further half an hour a total wait of minutes from arrival of the vessel and before we started disembarking only to find then that because of the parking arrangement those who were loaded at dieppe in the first group were the last to leave the vessel in newhaven it was a case of the first on was last off and then because of the being last off the wait at customs was also long i actually left the port about hour minutes after the vessel arrived quiet disgusting
ferry left on time but arrived nearly minutes late no announcements about delay or reason given
we traveled up with pearl and stayed overnight in oslo on the return trip we were with crown and although they are two quite different ferries the experience was great on both the whole childrens card concept is good and especially the horse race where the children join the nightclub was fun the staff were great on both ferries but especially quotthe pirate jonasquot on crown was exceptional he can make entertainment for both children and adults
it was an absolute disaster we were in dover hours before our scheduled departure and got in line and then nothing happened our lane didnt move not even a meter as our ships departure got closer and closer we asked and were told that they would process one lane at a time unfortunately this wasnt the case we still didnt move and our ferry drove away we could take the next one they said rudely absolute disaster never again with dfds booked months in advance and zero organization everyone who arrived much later drove past us nothing worked absolute rubbish
on outward journey my wife and i both got food poisoning from the restaurant return journey we were charged euro to take an earlier ferry even though it was only about full
the crossing may work for some locals for me the time taken to disembark was longer that the total eurotunnel experience added to that really very poor food with the only positive being a few friendly staff
in spite of the severe storm safely brought to ijmuiden not a pleasant trip but therefore was only one reason the storm
good information helpful assistants and a clean cabin we had a great trip just one observation on the rd july sailing from dieppe at no cabins were available on line or at the port ticket office yet when we were on board an announcement said cabins were available why the difference in information
it was a really good sailing i would travel again with dfds
both trips were easy to book both crossings were on time could not of asked for more
we arrived early in dover and were allowed to take a boat earlier so we only waited minutes and then got on the boat very nice
both journeys left on time and the check in for both were helpful in changing our sailing times
great ferry crossing easy booking in procedure effortless boarding and comfortable crossing on board catering was adequate if not a little expensive
great that it was no problem to rebook the ferry and take an earlier crossing it would be nice if it worked the other way round too and you could still get on if you missed a ferry i havent had that experience yet though but that would be customer loyalty regards tr
very friendly welcoming and helpful staff nice boats and efficient loading et good value
first time motorhomer returning from le mans to essex uk good points arrived calais early for our late ferry but pleasantly suprised to be put straight on the earlier boat with less than an hour to go at no extra charge no issues very thankful for this after long drive check in boarding swift and easy good onboard hot food selection again thankful after long drive bad points initially only one till open at main restaurant long queue standing with hot food waiting to pay not efficient very little comfy seating to relax in or snooze again rest essential after long drive difficult with very noisy coach loads of teenagers on board will look at premium lounge next time as this seemed empty and far more how i would expect comfy seating areas to be overall for a first time with our motorhome a good experience with a few lessons learned
good and friendly staff sailing on time
good points service ran on time facilities on board as advertised well maintained price of fare reasonable not so good lack of information boards while queuing surprising needlessly early predeparture arrival required mins before departure
we arrived hours early for our ferry home and they offered the earlier ferry which we accepted excellent service with minimal fuss couldnt do that on the airlines
journey was nice ferry was clean and staff was helpful food prices are very very high was a bit of a shock
as a regular sailor i cant find any faults with dfds
the loading operator damaged my motorcycle whilst preparing for the crossing the crew admitted liability but want me to claim through my insurance and potentially risk my no claims bonus the damage should be dealt with through your insurance your mistakes should be fixed by you
copy of message to dfds i contacted dfds on thu th june to see if it was possible to change my booking on st july one day ahead i was quickly told that it could not be done at all cf your conditions i asked for an explanation about this as i could not see that you would lose anything if there was free space and asked that this complaintfeedback be passed on but the person with you was clearly annoyed by my customer complaint and hung up this treatment is still difficult for me to accept as your customer so i chose not to use my ticket at all and i will probably never use dfds again
the booking checkin boarding and disembarking from the ferry were very well organized and easy to manage even for us who were booking a ferry for the first time on the return journey we were too early and were offered a different ferry directly by the manager that saved us two hours of waiting great the stay during the crossing was also pleasant seating snacks drinks we will always be happy to book with dfds again
french customs decided to go slow after my trip to dover was one to forget for example closure of the m and even though we arrived in plenty of time the french passport control decided to go slow then we were singled out by security for an inspection which meant we missed our sailing full marks to your check in staff who were very sympathetic and booked us on the next available sailing the service on board was excellent and i could not fault in any way full mark to dfds the best service across the channel by far
i have used dfds a few times previously and have always been impressed but having just returned from weeks in the netherlands i was really disappointed by the lack of ventilation air conditiong in the cabinwith of us it quickly became unbearable and ruined what should have been a pleasant experience the newcastle to amsterdam crossing is really handy for anyone travelling from scotland the ship is generally fine and the service was great we are in the buffet restaurant which was ok but not as good as i remember it being previously the cabins would have been ok and comfortable enough if there had been sufficient ventilation but they really are not suited for people as it is we had different cabins in different decks out and return and i note similar reported in other reviews so this isnt an isolated issue sort out the ventilation and it would be a solid or star review but im afraid that i wouldnt recommend king seaways to anyone right now
excellent connection friendly staff we could easily change our booked crossing without paying extra sailing with them regularly
employees super friendly even suggested rebooking to a ferry earlier but unfortunately it broke just before departure this returns it to the original time
returning from a long drive from holland we were told minutes before the ferry was to depart that it would be delayed for hours that turned out to be and a half hours kids my wife and i spent hour sitting in a car park with very little explanation as to why technical issues what is that i think they didnt want to do a crossing with not very many customers so they mug you off with a poor excuse for our time we were offered a coffee rubbish
ferry delays resulting in ongoing travel delays making it a bad day
customer service on arrival with attentive staff welcoming crew on the boat sadly the boat did have a technical fault which did significantly delay our arrival to port of dover
star is even too much tried booking online x both times payment been taken but no confirmation to then receive an email that it went wrong and payment will be refunded within days but now i am out of pocket cant pay for our journey that we tried booking because they have my money from bookings which we wont get back in time absolutely disgusting and no means to get in touch phone number is cents a minute and emails dont get answered and online form need a booking number which we dont have because of the error on their side i would avoid booking as they just take your money and leave you hanging
we arrived hours early as requested in dieppe there are no refreshments once you come through passport control although one of the first to be loaded we were the last to be disembarked adding an extra hour to the trip the ferry was half empty so would have taken even longer when full being trapped on an upper car deck all the fumes from the cars lorries below filled our deck during the hour they were disembarking when we asked a member of staff why we were last he quickly became aggressive and dismissive what had been a very pleasant trip was spoilt
couldnt fault any part of the service and was particularly happy with ease of changing the booking for our return journey
the travel regulations relating to cancellationcancellation have been significantly changed in these are regulations that very few people read and are well hidden on the website examples of new unreasonable fees for cancellation fee for cancellation days before departure is now of the total amount which includes all additional products dinners and other in the fee was if you cancel days before departure you get of the cancellation fee to get the cabin you want you must book early in the event of a cancellation of the best cabin types the shipping company sells these again within a day or two it is unreasonable that additional products such as dinners etc which are not used when canceled in good time have such fees the shipping company does not offer flex tickets like most others eg color line cancellation insurance only applies in the event of a medical certificate of illness have shared this on the facebook group quotdfds friendsquot with its members after a few minutes i received comments the changes in the travel regulations are changed unilaterally by the shipping company and are not actively communicated the content is largely unknown until you possibly have to cancel remember that it is the travel regulations at the time of booking that apply to the booking think carefully before you order do not order and pay for additional products until you are sure that you can travel
friendly staff helpful i had booked a bed in a fourperson cabin and had the cabin to myself the only negative thing was that the toilet flush didnt work properly it was quickly repaired but unfortunately it wasnt permanent
the trip was very fine things were good arranged so boarding and leaving the ship went smooth the only thing from giving you the extra star is the fact that the waiting in line with a dog in the car is to long he wasnt allowed to leave the car and then waiting for hours before boarding and hour before leaving te ship is quit long
its a beautiful ship well presented and very clean staff are very helpful and the crossing is such good value would definitely recommend
with gearbox linkage trouble a part had to be ordered from germany and with possible postal delay i put my return ferry back hours however i managed to get to dieppe later that evening and requested another rebooking to the next morning this was agreed with a further cost of i find this excessive i also found the toilets in the terminal building in a disgusting state no seat or flush on toilet soap or dryer in the disabled cubicle nor dryer in gentlemans area the ferry in both directions was entirely satisfactory but the toilets and staff leave a lot to be desired in the dieppe terminal alan poate
the confirmation of the booking did not arrive until an hour after payment the email we sent about this would be answered within days even though we were leaving the same day on the other hand upon arrival an unsolicited offer was made to rebook the trip to dunkirk instead of calais for free so that we could leave half an hour earlier
clear concise booking confirmation smooth onboarding car excellent cabin excellent buffet maps of the ship layout in more places would help you have to search less price of the cabin is very high
good company to deal with ships and staff are fine but the advertised hour crossing dundov dovdun is usually a little more that that plus the chunk of time that is then lost during the slow disembarkation process this is a weak area imo need to reckon on hm at least for this crossing
great a great price ferry crossing to france good price spirits on duty free friendly staff all make it worth while and stars for me bad top cash back still not paid months in as dfds rejected it although all criteria met and crossing was last weekend still in dispute restaurant food shocking poor steak chips and pepper sauce dry quiche quiche replaced but both meals left get a supermarket meal deal
great staff flexible with ferry arrival times
overnight from dieppe to newhaven dining facility and sleeping cabin with shower were very good staff were all pleasant only suggestion guidance on leaving car to find way into ship would have been helpful
brilliant service hassle free and very good staff outbound overnight our cabin was very clean and comfortable the return journey day crossing was equally as good a good selection of food and snacks was available al in all a very good expierence
cabin a dinner and breakfast and crew the same but sleep a the engines banged in the walls and beds all night so that no one from the oad group and others could sleep these were decks and perhaps dfds would hand out earplugs as a courtesy due to this inconvenience terminal very small no possibility to buy food or drinks very customer unfriendly space one toilet for ladies one for men for hundreds of people downright ridiculous the one in newcastle was huge parking spaces not covered back from scotland cars shat under by the seagulls so far we have not been able to get everything done june th to scotland with the oad marlika and ren roelofsen
everything was perfect very good reception loading and service on board were also great we are very satisfied and will use the dfds ferries again on our next trip thank you for this great experience
treated like real passengers and not cargo smooth booking and a smooth sail totally happy with price and customer service
great experience would highly recommend nice clean boat
the time to wait in dover is to much long in the ship the workers should fix the motorbikes and if the bikers want to do it by them self offer their help at the departure and at the arrival there was nobody in time and i had to handle the very dirty and oily lashing straps allone by myself my experience on the route amsterdamnewcastle is much more better the service there is very good
efficient service operating from the nondescript port of newhaven the only thing isthe food very poor and chewy euros for two tasteless plates bring back brittany ferries yes i know theyre more expensive but this was the start of our holiday
one of the most farfetched ordering experiences ive experienced i got a gift card for a free minicruise in the spring of and wanted to go in the summer because it already expired on june when i go in to book the trip and enter the discount code i see that there is a kroner discount on the order i do not understand this and then refresh the page where i enter the code again but it has now expired even though the purchase did not go through at all i write to them about what has happened to customer service and am told that if you redeem the discount coupon in the high season the journey will first of all cost more so original price kr this is not informed on the discount coupon anywhere in addition i am described as saying that the trip quotis also cheaper than it would have been without the cardquot okay thanks for the dkk discount furthermore there was no response that my ticket was now invalid once it had been entered i obviously have to live with that you should be ashamed of yourself dfds
everything worked everything to top marks not the last time we travel with dfds thats for sure
overall expensive especially wifi amp shop long waiting times when boarding and leaving the ship high car
checking in and boarding were straight forward the ferry left on time for each crossing staff were helpful and very pleasant what more could you want
easy to book it was our first trip on a ferry we found the whole process of checking in and boarding very easy to understand a lot easier than i thought we missed our ferry due to traffic and we phoned customer service and they arranged for us to travel at a later time will definitely use the company for our next trip
perfect trip with dfds my grandmother and i were on a knitting cruise on pearl seaways on our trip we met two fantastic employees who we will never forget these two made our trip a fantastic experience i would therefore like to highlight fathi b from the seas restaurant and mathias n from the navigator bar the two of them provide the best customer service and make you feel welcome both are good with a joke and have high spirits huge praise to these two dfds must be very happy for them two smiling sweet and fantastic employees who go the extra mile for their customers huge praise from here and many many thanks for making our trip extra special we hope you will be there the next time we sail with pearl seaways
the checkin was super friendly communicative and helpful we were a little early at the port and were able to take an earlier ferry without any problems as there was still space i thought that was great all the staff on the ship were also very friendly the ship offers everything for a relaxed crossing even for children
one of staff members without even asking my ticket automaticly asumed am not a trucker and rude asked to leave he automaticly asumed that just becouse i had teen kids with me all this also happened becouse a lack of sighns and explanations where is what stena line is always polite and extra helpful and dfds was rely unplesant been my second trip with them but am not happy least time they even didnt had wifi working which i think is extra important while u travel and place was a bit filthy
klaipeda kiel victoria seaways gave easy access on and off for foot passengers this was provided by bus between terminal building and the ramp leading into the ship itself there were no unnecessary delays of holdbacks and that is vital when planning onward journey by public transport other transport modes as you can calculate connections the ship had good outdoor decks for viewing and clean open air as smokers had to keep to clearly designated areas the buffet restaurants offered good quality cooking making the purchase of meal vouchers worth the while on our journey all staff were friendly and helpful the journey time may seem long but it is much shorter than an overland journey and you see interesting coastline and marine activities both klaipeda and kiel are fantastic and interesting cities in their own right each offering lots both klaipeda and kiel have local bus routes nearby found by google search connecting frequently to railway and bus stations
it was a good journey great staff at dieppe newhaven and on board it just always takes so long to get off the boat
beautiful boat everything went quickly and efficiently very friendly crew update about the late arrival time would have been good
really good experience on board with helpful and polite staff all the time just the shuttle bus in newcastle could have been better organised otherwise it would have been definitely five stars
calais to dover nice clean ferry with plenty of space to sit staff were friendly and helpful easy boarding and exit with camper van would use again i star dropped for direct price with dfds being same as using direct ferries
fast on and off cabin could be a lot cheaper considering there was no soap or toilet paper on the outward crossing very thin walls and very noisy truck drivers next door on return crossing suspect they got a cheap onboard last minute deal apart from that all was as expected
the crew on the outward journey were very efficient and all went well the weather on our return trip was awful but the staff were so jolly and happy it made the crossing feel much quicker the beer pump failed but the bar staff coped well and were cheerful the food station was superb with lots of choice and again cheerfully delivered the guy on the till deserves a special mention he was helpful chatty and had us both laughing even the deck crew waived as we drove off we have had many years using dfds now and cannot recommend them enough very well done
a shambolic business with near useless customer service they wiggle out of the price promise guarantee with the most outrageous excuses i honestly wonder if anyone has ever been successful in claiming the difference between booking with them and alternative websites save yourself some money and time by booking with alternative booking websites for the exact same crossing but at a significant discount and without the headache going direct creates in my case i would have saved with directferries the audacity to charge per minute if you wish to speak to someone with the alternative a day response time to each email absolute joke of a business my experience with both janice and marcia has been far from acceptable you have been warned update despite sending an email as requested i have no response from martin shameful update still no response update almost months later it appears the business has finally admitted fault and have issued a partial refund for a portion the difference not the full difference amount i hasten to add i wont be amending my star rating as to be truthful the whole process has been shambolic
the was no choice to pay in euro in dfds program and i had to pay additional bank fees for currency change
we didnt expect the crossing to be like a quotstripped downquot cruise with a pub with live music and a nightclub
on the outward journey we had to wait a very long time hours before we could get on the boat which was much more efficient and faster
out bound trip cabin was dirty and tired needed complete revamp soap dispencer didnt work return trip worst ship i have every been on light fittings hanging off the wall rust around the sink dirty toilet area i would not recommend dfds any of my friends or family i would recommend they take the time and travel to forkestone to get the train to eu it would take less time and much less stress also a lot cheaper as dfds was a ripoff
dear dfds team i have nothing to complain about the journey from amsterdam to newcastle on th june we had a quiet cabin on deck on the king seeways but as nice as the journey there was the return journey was even more underwhelming although we had booked the same category our cabin was on deck that alone would not be a problem but our cabin on the princess seeways was apparently right above the propeller it was the noisiest place in the entire ship sleeping there is hardly possible it is absolutely baffling to me that both cabins should fall under the same category if i have to assume to spend another night in such a cabin as on the princess seaways i will not book dfds again with kind regards jan schulte
clean ship clean toilets attentive staff easy to rebook a crossing
we were booked on an earlier ferry on the way there because we were there early and there was space the prices for food were very high
have used the oslo to copenhagen ferry route a number of times and have never been disappointed the cabins are older and could do with a revamp but they are clean and the shower always hot and powerful the public areas have been upgraded and all nice the food and drink very reasonably priced and a well stocked tax free shop this has to be the most scenic route of any ferry i have been onits a great adventure if you choose the mini cruise option and a chance to explore oslo great at any time of year but esp feb with ice on the fjord
everything was fine there is just one small thing we would have liked to have known that we could get on board first as we had to leave frederikshavn minutes before departure we thought we could get on board when we booked in so we were in frederikshavn at it was a long wait
arrived early bumped up to an earlier ferry fantastic service
i have been traveling with dfds for years and everything has been taken care of very well and neatly if there is no commodore de luxe cabin available i will not sail thats why i book well in advance only previously you had priority for boarding and disembarking and you were placed near the elevator now it was very tight with parking i am very careful with my car so i am considering not going with dfds anymore this was very disappointing
out and back sailings on time nice staff and the sea facing cabin we had was comfortable and quiet if i had one criticism it would be that the food on board was a bit expensive but overall it was a very good ferry service and i highly recommend it
we booked a crossing but had to go home early to charge or for a rebooking hours earlier is an quotoutragequot not with dfds in the future yours sincerely
early season booking earned a valuable flexi upgrade used flexibility to bring forward outward crossing a day on board facilities were good and staff were cheerful and efficient good to see cafe now open in calais as well as shop in the new dfds facility used both of these overall a positive experience
we were cyclists on a weeks tour of holland our experience with dfds was very good getting on and off was ok not too long a delay the staff on the ship were very helpful and knowledgeable the cabins were very clean and the washroom systems worked we used the bars and restaurants which were also great service and food in the a la carte restaurant was good as were the staff and we got great service in the bars to sum up no complaints
clean ferry pleasant staff easy check in and baording procedure newhavendieppe crossing
smooth crossing uncrowded and comfortable ship friendly staff on time no hold ups with passports or customs easy access into newhaven and out of dieppe
its a bit too easy to say that there is an hour and a half delay would have liked a little more explanation why while we had left newcastle on time and there was no heavy weather june
simplicity from enquiry online booking and then the journey first time on a ferry and it wont be my last food on board was quality and the entire boat was spotless
i arrived early got on an earlier boat fantastic no waiting around
customs and ticket office takes way to long takes way to long to board everything if you book to leave art you can add easy min same with arriving food is to expensive for what you get same as price for tickets way to high
i punctured my rear motorcycle tyre as i boarded your vessels on a metal spikenot seen by my self wegded in the metal frame you had to drive over the senior officer came down to the deck and took photos of the spike in my tyre he printed and provided photos and took the detailswhen we docked i was the last to leave the ship helped by the officer and another member of the team on the docks rob from the security team helped load the bike into the rescue van as it was not possible to drive the bike this was good of them thank you my nearly new tyre is scrap i will have to purchase a new tyre i will complete the forms and seek compensation i had to stay over as no tyre company was open on the sunday hope they are as good as the other reviews says
people travelling with bikes the process was very smooth and easy to follow we found the staff to be very friendly the food on board was good on both outward journey and return we would most definitely travel with dfds again
unfortunately the good marks are due to the ferry being nearly empty the lounge was almost empty and the loading was fast in fact we got on the sailing instead of the the crossing is as it always is and as we would expect
this is the third time we have taken the ferry from dunkirk to dover and back the competence and friendliness of the staff deserves special mention the great service in the vip lounge is also very good what is particularly important however is the relaxed journey to the ferry too early or too late no problem then you take the earlier or later ferry everything is quite simple and completely uncomplicated we will be travelling with dfds again for the fourth time kind regards marion and holger klein
it does not seem possible to cross from calais to dover as a passenger without a car when i email about it i get no response strange experience
excellent trip with dfds from dieppe to newhaven no queues to check in no separate dog check in and professional boarding and come out into beautiful british countryside perfect
we use your service regularly to travel to france usually dover to calais midday on a sunday and dunkirk to dover return again midday on a sunday we usually find the whole process very easy and if we have made it down from derbyshire in good time are often put on an earlier ferry which is great we book the later one in case we have any traffic problems on our hour journey lunchtime food is always good breakfast not so with everything barely luke warm or cold the toilets at the dunkirk terminal are very smelly and not a pleasant experience you have to be desperate after travelling to use them things pretty much always run in time ad we are quite happy with the journeys we have made with you over the last few years
prompt service at the checkin and loaded on time a little later than advertised arriving in dunkirk but very efficient disembarkation excellent selection of food and drink duty free shop was wellstocked
loading and unloading took way too long normally travel from portsmouth to caan and we are off in twenty minutes to half hour last night it took over an hour to get off
a very clean and tidy ferry boarding was quick and efficient i had a very good experience with all the staff members we had a disabled passenger in our group and the port staff ferry staff and everyone involved were brilliant just a shame yet again that able bodied passengers insist on trying to use the lift when there are only flights at the most to get to the vehicle deck
i recently had the opportunity to travel with dfds from calais to dover and i would like to share my experience overall the crossing was pleasant and i was satisfied with the service checkin at the port of calais went smoothly the staff were friendly and helpful and gave clear instructions on how to board the wait time until departure was relatively short and i had plenty of time to look around and buy snacks the ship itself was well equipped and clean there were various areas to hang out in including restaurants cafes and lounges i opted for the buffet restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the choice and quality of the food the food was freshly prepared and there was a wide variety of dishes to suit all tastes there were enough entertainment options during the crossing to pass the time arrival in dover also went smoothly disembarkation was well organised and there were clear instructions on how to leave the ship overall i was satisfied with my crossing with dfds from calais to dover the service was good the staff were friendly and the ship had plenty of entertainment options i would definitely recommend dfds for this route
it was good that the times were flexible meaning that if you were stuck in a traffic jam you could take a later ferry that was very reassuring
both ferries late even though weather super calm and both ports empty loading and un loading took way too long wifi very poor on outbound
no queues at dunkirk meant we had a very quick and easy check in experience ferry was delayed coning into port by mins but managed to make up some of that time ferry was clean offered a good range of catering options and the staff were friendly and helpful no delays getting us off the boat at dover
fast crossing relaxation lounge is okay but badly in need of a makeover on the crossing suddenly took almost hours instead of no not counting the time difference but nothing was reported about that when descending to the parking deck we suddenly received bottles of water and bags of chips from a catering employee compensation for the delay no idea no explanation there is nowhere to go on deck so there is no fresh air in short old barges but fortunately the crossing does not take that long so it is bearable
straight into your room as soon as you have boarded is excellent after a long drive food in the restaurant is first class remembering how many people they are serving in such a short period of time every member of staff was polite and extremely helpful would give stars if i could the other ferry company i use from south of england could learn a thing or two from dfds
a little bumpy at first but smoothed out after an hour or so left mins late due the number of cars crossing but made up the time so we arrived on time only issue was that it took just over an hour to get off and through customs but thats okay
was able to book more passenger at the end all information in nl we quickly got through the checks at ferry locations
nice and clean ship no delayes really happy with my choice
ferry delayed due to broken down lorry on outward ferry however no one told us and we were left sitting in the sun not knowing when we would sail not a great selection of sandwiches on offer ship clean and tidy and staff friendly
another seamless ferry crossing with dfds have been using these guys for a number of years and in my opinion they are better than the other ferry companies operating from dover ferrys are always clean unlike p o staff always friendly and helpful unlike p o and they seem to be getting better at the duty free offering well done and keep up the great work
had no reason to complain bit late departing but got back earlier than we should of so was great going there was straight through no problems at all so all round very satisfying
overnight from newcastle to amsterdam in our m motorhome arrived well in time but they boarded us last amongst cargo and commercial lorries all other motorhomes and campers were together in designated rows after a night in a cabin with a pillow that was beyond useless we returned to our vehicle which was totally blocked in with freight no view forward to see what was happening basically we were forgotten after minutes we were eventually unloaded however it was a precarious manoeuvre and we had to drive over raised anchor points a few strange noises from under the van but no sign of anything so we continue our journey only to experience the noise of a broken suspension coil spring on day of our holiday dfds are not accepting any liability as we did not report the damage on the ship our crystal ball clearly wasnt working how could we report something that wasnt evident on the ship should we have reported a noise they are just incompetent and we will never travel with them again
easy and efficient loading and unloading on the ferry premium lounge very nice and welcoming we like the dunkirk route and will sail that route again
ship good app good as well i had to cancel a crossing due to not being well managed to do it easily and rebook
departed late slow to unload passenger vehicles
because of a physical disability i was able to park the car very close to the lift this was very convenient for me and my companion
we were asked to be there hours early which was unnecessary the return journey was delayed the food on board was quite poor areas of the boat smelt quite bad i dont see why people cant go down to their cars a bit earlier too
generally we are happy using dfds when travelling to france as they are flexile and helpful one thing however gets to me and that is travelling with pets a dog in our case you pay for a return trip only for the dog to sit in a car why do i pay anything in that case i cannot take my dog on board the dog does not take space there is no additional service provided either why do i have to pay
why on earth can you not cancel a booking a month away from the crossing too only bothered giving a star because its remarkable that there is a phone number to speak to someone there
staff were friendly and easy to find the cabin was clean four stars because the foot passenger arrangements for disembarking are not clear you are bussed to the ferry this would be a great time to tell people where and how to disembark on the way out to dieppe we eventually found a small sign saying we should disembark at that point on the way back to newhaven there was a small sign saying to go to reception but no instruction on what to do once there and no steward an engineer told us to go to the dieppe disembarkation point causing delay there should be an announcement on the bus and permanent signs on the boat advising the foot passengers disembarkation points for each port
return journey was cancelled so had a delay of minutes i dont normally travel by ferry as get sick but the crossings were ok overall experience was positive but of a wait to get down to deck to return to vehicle
had to call customer services a couple of times prior to sailing and found the staff to be incredibly efficient helpful and friendly
cancelled earlier ferry loaded after ferry was due to depart this delayed departure time after sitting at the port for hours ferry was dirty and unkempt we saw dfds staff members in the terminal one was swearing very loudly wearing his dfds uniform very unprofessional maybe needs to remember they are representing dfds as a company and act professional around passengers
hassle free experience the staff were great we turned up on time but due to border control queues missed our ferry but was able to jump on the next one free of charge
arrived min after checkin had already closed traffic jams on the way to port newcastle but dfds staff still present friendly and very efficiently helped me board last one what a ride
went with dfds on feb this year cabin was not clean and the bedding had mould on the pillows as well as hair from a previous occupant all the food which was pre paid was cold and not pleasant to eat the drop off point in amsterdam pre paidwas miles from the city centre and as a disabled and elderly passenger this meant i could not see the town so ended up going back to the ship on the first available bus been in contact with the company since my return both by letter an email and so far despite all attempts i am being constantly fobbed off they will take no responsibility for the trip and have offered nothing by way of compensation not that i have asked for any for the cold food or the stranding in amsterdam sorry i will never as long as i live travel with them again they do not deserve my business
it was a very good experience traveling with dfds from booking onboard experience and timing everything was smooth and efficient on our way back it took longer at uk border check dfds automatically rebooked a space on to the next available ferry
return too slow loading at dunkirk running late poor facilities at dunkirk no cafe metal toilet bowls not pleasant at dunkirk going out at calais extremely busy but well organised
very rapid outgoing crossing left early and arrived early easy disembarkation good food and facilities on both crossings slower loading and unloading on return crossing but ship was quite full so probably to be expected and delay was due to pedantic customs checks very good value for money
the crossing and general service provided by dfds is good but i dont understand why you constantly underestimate the crossing time every time we have travelled the crossing takes a minimum of minutes longer than advertised and this does not include embarkation or disembarkation time also on the last crossing we made i was most surprised to see your staff in the seven seas restaurant actively allowing underage teenagers to engage in drinking games in full view of other minors not a good luck in any way at all
i arrived at check in early and you got me on to an earlier ferry with no fuss which was very much appreciated thank you
convenient comfortable and relaxed way to travel with a dog as a foot passenger the dogfriendly cabins are great as is having access to the outdoor space having flown with my dog i would recommend the ferry over flying to anyone with a pet yes it is a longer journey but it is so stressfree its more than worth it checkin and out is quick and easy meaning you arent hanging about with your dog and staff are always welcoming
for the first time i travelled with dfds it was wonderful
always happy boating with dfds very organised getting on and off the boat hot and cold food always available and plenty of places to sit while enjoying my voyage
ferry was clean and loads to do on board staff were great and very helpful really enjoyed the buffet for evening meal and breakfast such a good choice of foods only thing i think would make it better is maybe a small shop selling sandwiches and snacks etc as on the ferry home we werent hungry enough for a big meal and my son just wanted a sandwich
late boardingdont know why an explanation would have been appreciated we had two dogs with us and arriving hours before departure time we thought would help eliminate any delays but no no difference on board we could not hear the tannoy announcements the offers in the duty free shop were nearly nonexistant and the disembarkation was rubbish we sat with our dogs in the car and waited for minutes for something to happen then we had to reverse the full length of the ship to get off really not good but then it was a cheap crossing for us
reason for stars there was quite a long delay at dunkirk due to staff change over the turning off and on of the computer system seems a little unnecessary for changing staff members put an extra minutes on us getting into the port which was quite disappointing however the crew on board your vessel was absolutely superb as per normal
what made our journey so enjoyablewas to sail earlier than bookedexcellent we will use dfds again
dfds service and ferries excellent premium lounge charge slightly high for what you receive long wait at dover check in not directly dfds fault as their part of this checkin was fast but dover port need to get to grips with higher volumes during school breaks and peak times
clean ferries punctual departure and arrival staff helpfull when need and loading and unloading efficient and effective
perfect service as always but its high time for new larger ferries where even larger motorhomes can still get travel dates and pay reasonable prices
as always a problemfree trip with dfds friendly comfortable ships friendly crew always happy to use again
after a bad start the website froze several times as we were booking our overall experience was good and i would use again getting on and off the ferry to calais with our motorhome was very efficient staff were helpful and very friendly the ferries were clean with plenty of seating the food was good but a bit on the pricey side as you would expect on a ferry
we were able to take an earlier ferry the lounge was great and quiet
we used the overnight crossings both ways as it suited our driving times to end locations our only issue was with the seating which was not very comfortable to get some sleep the cabins were available of course but for a hour crossing not good value for money however great service and good ferry prices that we will use again
completely unreasonable conditions have booked a trip copenhagenoslo for people and car due to circumstances we have to cancel and we read from the terms and conditions that if we cancel more than days in advance we lose of the value of the trip dkk in loss unfortunate but acceptable in the event of cancellation dfds announces that the journey is part of an offer car for which is why we lose all dkk in the event of cancellation change of date is also seen as cancellation
every think was good but inside the ferry very very cold they did not open heater and now im flu
the staff were nice and the cabin has a large window but the upper bunks bed horse is very small and there are a lot of night alarms when we had to disembark in oslo there was chaos people came down the stairs escalator and elevator at the same time creating a bottleneck those of us on the escalator were caught between those who continued to come down and those who were in front and could not go on one of our party has a mobility impairment and was very exposed it was a super unpleasant experience it could easily be managed better you can also look after passengers even if they have just left the ship so unfortunately we will not be using dfds again
everything was very efficient and staff very friendly however we needed to sail on an earlier crossing and were prepared to pay the extra cost found i couldnt change the booking online and could not call the booking office as it was on a friday plus a bank holiday so we went to the booking office at dieppe to be told the booking could not be altered even though there was space on an earlier ferry due to the booking switchboard closed for the weekend very frustrating
breakfast was not worth the price the rolls were hard on the outside the croissants were dry and the orange juice tasted like it had been diluted there were only banana chips for the yoghurt and only grapefruit and melon for fruit the bathroom in the cabin could also do with a renovation corrosive drain halfrotten joints i regularly travel the fredrilshavnoslo route with dfds and everything is much better here why is the ferry to newcastle worse incomprehensible it takes minutes for the first car to roll off the ferry which is probably due to brexit the signs in amsterdam could also be clearer and bigger
ferries were punctual clean and comfortable
there was plenty of comfortable seating available the loading crew took took reasonable care when securing the motorcycle this route worked well for me and it seems less congested than the alternative dover routes
we have used this ferry between newcastle and amsterdam pre and post brexit for the past years dfds always delivers on its service and quality there are some useful tips but this is not the forum suffice to say we have have stayed in all grades of cabin and despite the benefits of cost in the range an economy cabin with a window remains the best option especially if two are travelling together the window option tends to put you higher up and away from ships noise its only for one night and our experience has been good overall in that cabin the food on offer especially the buffet has always been a good standard and varied enough to suit any taste there has been some cost cutting in entertainment for example the once excellent cabaret show inclusive to all has now been replaced by music groups whom often struggle the cabaret show with dancers etc supported the company ethos of cruising away but sadly seems to have replaced that said there is plenty to do for all ages and for the time on the ferry its perhaps enough a further issue which dfds should consider and despite our repeated customer feedback has not been developed is a customer loyalty scheme based around frequent use and spending where points or similar can be collected to offset costs on any service dfds have withdrawn from nectar so perhaps this should be reconsidered a good service and on the whole value for money however should the ferry service return from rosyth scotland to the netherlands then a dramatic rethink will be needed to maintain its customer base
the price is very goodbut this reflects the service as unloading is usually incredibly slow and always has been the state of the boat is also not good and desperately needs a refurbishment staffing numbers on board have obviously been reduced recently
travelling with dfds most years we are fully aware of the experience however having been asked to rate this experience then i need to be honest the crew are excellent they are pleasent and attentive and nothing is too much trouble the cabins and the sleeping experience is not as good it is by no means a hotel stay and there is absolutely no sound proofing between cabins maybe my expectations are higher than when the ship was designed but you hear every cough sneeze snore and other noises that passengers either side make not that i am any better but this doesnt make for a good nights sleep i will reiterate i know what i am getting and it achieves my aim of making the continent on a bike without driving the length of the uk food in the buffet was perfect a good choice and a great standard breakfast was average what can dfds do better not a lot until it is time to renew there fleet i will be travelling next year
on time no too much wait at the border pleasant crossing
friendly smooth journey clean on board good service excellent food we will definitely go back with dfds nr dover
great company we booked a crossing from norway to denmark months ago very stupid of us we booked from denmark to norway the shipping company was still able to ensure that this worked out for us and without extra costs great service top company thank you family the young
as always on the long journey to ferry along couple thousands kilometres ocuring delay is part of the journey and flexibility of dfds always helps was like so alongside of last more than ten years thanks
everything was great just a very long wait before we could drive the car out of the ship we had purchased a commodore de luxe cabin so i thought we would have priority boarding and disembarking otherwise everything is great
when i first made the booking i was surprised to see that i had to check in one hour before sailing would it be difficult to mention this before someone chooses the sailing time furthermore i only have good things to say about dfds excellent service and very friendly staff tax free isnt quite wat it says though found a tax free item that was the same price as in the shop in holland and here the tax is high on everything so i didnt make use of anything on offer but overall a good experience
i had an awful trip to the ferry and arrived hours late they let me on straightaway no fuss im very grateful
on ferry arrival in oslo we had to wait more than an hour to get through customs that is less time in oslo to see the city
was disappointed not to be able to get euros on board which left us in a fix in france other than that no problems and very helpfull on our return earlier than expected
the ferry was on time and we were one of the first off the boat and so through customs really fast wonderful especially as we have two cats with us who are very long suffering but it reduces the time they are cooped we up somewhat on some occasions we have taken an hour or more to get through customs
bought tickets directly with dfds for a single journey newhavendieppe for did some research later on in the day and found a booking for the same journey out plus a return ticket through direct ferries for a total of contacted dfds to ask for a refund less than hr after i booked with them they refused after many emails they finally agreed to refund me but at that point all ferry prices had gone up so no point requested a price match refund but now not responding to my emails
the premium lounge the ferry being on time
good and polite service everywhere on the boat
very easy to book easy site to navigate and good comunication smooth check in and pleasant sea crossing would highly recommend
having used po for years i decided to try dfds last year for the st time and i was very impressed this year it was exactly the same the ship is good and clean and the staff were excellent all round i will not be going back to po
ferries in both directions were on time staff were friendly overnight cabin was comfortable fares were good value catering is good ship interiors were dated and some areas were scruffy daytime seats are uncomfortable for such a long crossing
check in was very easy register plates were scanned so time to get the tickets for the ferry was less than a minute we have done this trip several times more than times in total with this company and all the time we could recomend it
i have traveled several times with dfds frederikshavnoslo and i am surprised every time for the service that is imposed on us customers i am so grateful and humbled by their handling of problems which of course can happen during the booking of the trip and especially after it is selfservice and even if it can be just for the time being it is always an experience smile this time i called customer service to hear about something about the cabin i wanted to book unfortunately there has either been a misunderstanding or the nice young gentleman i spoke to didnt know any better no matter what it wasnt more of a problem than something personal but enough to make me anxious i met a nice woman who greeted me at the reception and immediately she found a solution that allowed me to immediately relax and with even more a service to upgrade us not only that but the whole pleasure of talking to the other nice staff members and getting help with practical things and information on various things just makes me so happy and proud to be able to say that i am a customer of dfds many thanks for you and your enormous kindness spaciousness and service in addition to my optics i bow and thank you if i could give stars it would be done so from here a big big number
straight forward easy check in clean and tidy ships and very friendly staff
i was verry early in the harbor but i dit not get the boat earlier
nice trip had a delicious and pleasant trip however something unexpected happened on the boat that required extra help the mate was quickly told the situation and took it up with the captain where the captain quickly got a helicopter out to us that could fly us ashore and take us to the hospital i have never felt as safe on the water as i have with dfds they act so fast and before we knew it we were safely on land and being looked after wish i could make more stars because they really deserve it for their efforts thanks to the mate and the captain for the quick action it wont be the last time you see us
great shopping in duty free calais the coffee shop was good ferry journey excellent as usual all staff well trained and pleasant to deal with looking forward to another crossing in july
apauling service from this company booked a ferry to france but illness forced me to cancel two weeks before travelling only to be told by dfds that cancelling my booking would cost me the whole of the ticket fare leaving me with nothing never again people beware
all the staff on both crossings that we met were all helpful and had a ready smile the check in staff member even got us loaded on an earlier ship the english breakfasts were great very tasty
coach left to go back to port mins befor they said last bus would leave left me and my girlfriend stranded
the restaurant was very good with a wide choice boarding was quick and on time it is a shame that the uk and french border control are not on the same side as in dover as it slows things up on arrival saved us about miles of driving and associated tolls compared to using calais staff were very helpful on board things are charged in euros which was a surprise
we officially booked with netferry it but almost everything there was a disaster we had to rebook quickly because we had to cancel the planned trip due to a death communication in german would have been great netferry only has english and they respond very slowly nothing was possible online because when we logged in with an email address and booking number we always got the same answer error cannot be found as everything ultimately goes through the shipping company dfds and they have a hamburg number we tried that early on the number is redirected to newcastle but thank god the employee spoke german we got quick problemfree help here rebooking in just minutes very nice employee thank you very much for making it possible for usme to get to my mother quickly next time we will book straight away through dfds
both trips late at night but cant complain about the ferry service staff always helpful if needed
excellent service in check in excellent time keeping and inside service in the ferry itself
we had to wait very long in the car before we could leave the boat
ive always thought your company as being fabulous however on my recent last trip there were two shortcomings firstly there was no soap to wash the hands within the gents toilets at the duty free building dunkirk my wife confirmed with me that the ladies loo had no such problems its not something i would otherwise have bothered to mention but as youve asked me to give you a review i feel it needs mentioning secondly on boarding the boat we set off from the docks a good mins later than we should have before its suggested that there was still some boarding going on i can confirm with you that the ramps were up ready for launch by the time dfds advertise departure time as the lost time with the delay was never caught up at the other end dover customer service should have kicked in with some form of excuse over the tannoy and maybe an apology that would have been greatly appreciated before its suggested that one was given out neither my wife nor myself heard one we have both been delighted with dfds in the past and we would use no other we have put this experience down to a bad day at the office
the choice was between a car or a trip with the danskebten to get to copenhagen to visit grandchildren this summer brilliant help from miriam on the phone who helped us with everything we needed
usual excellent service from dfds staff and food and drink cheaper than in amsterdam everything was spotless on princess seaways and duty free spirits and beer cheaper than airports will return again many times well done
punctual sailings on both legs friendly and helpful staff plus the premium lounge makes for an especially relaxing trip would certainly recommend dfds
spain holiday the trip in general is quite easy no problems boarding with car caravan meals on board good seating comfortable so trip was good will use again my one gripe would be traveling to the port we traveled the a ext at jtn following to dieppe road signage was appalling on one roundabout directions on two different exits on one roundabout the road leading down to the port was closed nothing to say you could enter port there was quite a number of people finding directions difficult i would ask dfds to check this out please
took off and landed on time i asked if there was a priority boarding and i boarding facility but was told only if you were disabled why not introduce a speedy boarding system for those who do not wish to await up to minutes toget off and clear passport control
ferries on time outward and return but delay waiting to berth in calais and no announcement made good price using multi tickets nice clean vessels
the ferry was punctual and not too full my only complaint is the bike storage facilities the racks provided arent suitable for bikes loaded with panniers too likely to end up with warped wheels and fat tyres on electric bikes wont even fit in the racks other lines simply let you tie your bike to railings along the side of the car decks as the newhaven dieppe route is so popular with cyclists this would be worth remedying
great ferry much cleaner than your rivals friendly staff and very moist cakes no issues at checkin at dunkerque
punctual departure would find it even better if disembarkation could be speeded up
after i made a mess of my reservation i was saved by morten who straightened things out so that our summer holiday in norway will be as desired and not as short as i had made it to be thanks for the help we are looking forward to another trip with the oslo boat
nobody cares about what i write here but its not our first travel with dfds on this route but food was awfull arrival was more then minutes late with not announcement or apologies for it why do people carrying pets have to wait till last to board and have to wait longtime to disembark above that no wifi working the whole trip so we couldnt message people that we were later really not nice will think twice before travelling again with dfds kind regards filip
just back from a trip to belgium with our car jumped on the ferry at newcastle on the th to amsterdam and drove the rest of the way my first trip on a ferry and it was made so easy the staff welcomed you good food drinks flowing couldnt of asked it to be more chill the trip home was even better on the th i felt comfortable and chill as ever definitely be using them to travel again
this was the pm ferry on friday th may as we changed our booking everything fine staff friendly boat very quiet it was a calm journey so why did we dock minutes late i saw no good reason and it made us late for booking in at our hotel for a meal it is a hour crossing not and a half hours very frustrating i always use dfds because they are usually quiet and comfortable the food good and the service polite but this slowness has happened a few times now so wondering if its time for a change
uncomplicated when rebooking to an earlier ferry
upon arrival in dover around pm we were asked if we wanted to take a boat earlier but to calais at pm instead of the booked crossing to dunkirk at pm it did save some time which we of course responded to thank you for this proposal
boarding and disembarking was well organised remembering it was outside peak time boat was clean and comfortable
further to my earlier review of the outward crossing i again allowed more time than was necessary for my return road journey from the netherlands to dunkirk port i expected to be rejected being several hours early but was allowed on the next crossing without hesitation and with a smile by the person on duty french security very unpleasant and heavyhanded but that was not the fault of dfds and we were still able to board
easy crossing well organised and a much easier way to go to france than struggling through dover when we were unfortunately unable to travel on this booking last year joni at dfds customer services was extremely helpful in helping us to rebook so full marks to dfds
very quick boarding and allowed to go on earlier ferry from dover which cut our overall travel time
nice exterior cabin with bunk beds fits well for adults and children but miserable staff on pearl seaways departure from copenhagen rude and unprofessional when you approach them with questions think that as a passenger you must feel that you are a burden and a nuisance and you have to ask because dfdss website only deals with offers so that they can fill up their ship for cheap after which they get their moneys worth in the restaurant coffee shop and dutyfree on departure from frederikshavn the captain smashes the ship into the quay so that a cloud of concrete flies up between the quay and the ship and you can hear the sound of metal being pressed and damaged the children fly out of the bunk and everything in the cabin falls from shelves and borders no call out about what has happened despite the fact that there has been damage to the ship aft on the port side which could be seen on arrival in oslo all those with herring salad on their shoulders also stood and looked at the damage upon arrival in oslo so great to have boys who were very afraid to sail from frederikshavn after such a terrible departure grotesque furthermore you couldnt sleep either as the disco had to have their sound level so high that the whole ship could hear them stay away from dfds both the staff the mate and the captain are unprofessional and i doubt that security is as it should be at dfds
everything was fine on the outward journey on our way back to the terminal much too early we were transferred to another boat for free completely well organised
the worst ferry to travel i will not even give star but need to we took ferry from amsterdam to newcastle payed extra for dog friendly cabin which didnt include dog so we payed extra for dog you need phone them too and that is extra for changing booking on phone what we couldnt travel back to uk as planned because they changed rules and we need passports insted id cards no one explain me why on website is wrong informationo on dfds government website and ambasady in london explained that we can travel till with id cards due to eu settlement scheme when send them emails whit photo of rulles what they have on website but was ignored and never got any reply i rebook ferry i pay even more due to prices difference but the price was cheaper what we allredy payed i check on webside before reboking when we back home to uk next day they gives us refound but anothere day they took money back from bank account without explanation why and without promision we will never take that ferry company again the worst experience and ripoff
unfortunately i missed my sailing due to an accident on the way dfds kindly moved me to a later sailing for minimal extra cost
good service since we arrived early at the port we were immediately asked if we had been on a boat before and quickly rebooked
good information before the trip nice service on board the boat
i enjoyed the return journey from dunkirk to dover it was a nice comfortable and clean boat both outward and return journeys left and arrived on time
great experience the ferry was on time and clean and the staff were pleasant and happy
we had booked a commodore de luxury cabin when i compare the facilities on the king seaways i think the cabin on the pricess seaways is expensive
on my way back from uk dover to duinkerken i was early at the terminal during checkin i was asked if an earlier boat to calais was something interesting for us it was and they rebooked me without any additional charges nice and proactive
we sailed from ijmuiden to newcastle by boat booking is easy as is getting on board crew members on the boat are generally very friendly and communicative especially the wait staff we had a sea view cabin for the outward journey it wasis quite small thats why we booked the commodore class cabin on the return trip i can recommend that to everyone x larger and a nicer place on the boat there are many opportunities to go outside on the boat at the bow both sides and of course the sky bar we thought the food was fine but nothing to write home about at the same time there were a lot of people eating their fill so it must have something to do with us
so smooth and easy friendly staff lovely ferrys
okay return trip to dunkirk was longer than announced the ferry is really dated and could therefore use a makeover
check in very efficient friendly staff ship departure on time it was a well run ship very clean and tidy staff all friendly and helpful a fantastic experience thank you
we were minutes late leaving dover and we had to wait minutes just outside dover to bearth as there was no room for us so late both journeys th and th april
the ships were clean and departed on time
our recent trip on dfds was very smooth from arriving and leaving everything went to plan
arrived at the terminal hours earlier than planned an earlier departure was no problem a very friendly welcome and very helpful staff made for a pleasant crossing moreover you can enjoy an excellent affordable meal
cabin quality should be improved other ferry company offers more departure delay yesterday wasnt communicated to passangers
boat is nice nice and steady crossing all staff was very friendly pleasant overall on the negative side though crossing time can be faster considering the new technologies paperwork can be optimised border control tickets there is no possibility to know in advance how your room look like so you may end up as a family of adults in a room that resembles with a closet also in a section of a boat you dont want to be one can know what time is the lunch only by asking at the info desk wifi access is extremely expensive and restrictive although nowadays we have starlink and other technologies like that so it should not be a super expensive luxury commodity
we chose dfds because of cheapest price and secondly location of both ports very happy with the ferry just right very friendly staff great seating for snoozing reclining chairs lovely food cant fault any of it although one thing that we were disappointed with and maybe we just got unlucky disembarking in our car took nearly an hour but a car had broken down towards the front of the queue each time so hopefully thats the reason anyway id travel again with dfds no question
ferry left and arrived on time cabin was clean and tidy and the shower was great so much cheaper than other operators
boarding process was very smooth apart from not being able to find the key to the empty gun cabinet in the back of my ven when requested by customs oops ship was excellent clean and tidy seating was very comfortable
ferry on time both ways clean and comfortableone star down because we phoned to see about an earlier crossing and told it would cost i think at night you could have fitted us on you had lots of room
another day trip completed with dfds i dont know if it is due to being a european flagged boat but the service is definitely a cut above i also appreciate the full food service which is missing on other operators must admit i prefer the cote de dune boat may be older but better laid out than the newer boats especially the food area
all steps to get on board went very smoothly crossing was over a calm sea even saw dolphins and seals worth repeating to go to england this way
dear sirmadam my wife and i recently travelled to england i booked online and when booking the cabins it automatically booked us for a double cabin i carried on booking til the end and paid there was no where i could book for a disabled cabin on the application it was automatic after i had booked the next day i phoned customer service and was told that i had to pay an extra for the cabin which i found a bit much as i am a pensioner and disabled no discount what so ever it should have been less for disabled on entering the cabin we looked around and found only power points one at each end of the cabin and a shaving point in the shower shaver only not for anything else we both have electric toothbrushes both have telephones i have a breathing machine a electric wheelchair and a false leg which all have to be charged that was impossible to do when i took a shower the so called shower seat bent so far down i fell off and the support rails nearly came out the wall and the floor was so slippery i could not get up when i finally got up with the help from my wife i looked at the rails and they where riverted in to the wallthey should be bolted and the floor was so old there was no grip just a smooth service there was no soap or anything in the bathroom plus the towels where very small and thin like a tea towel and when we went to eat we stopped at the restaurant to ask a question and the staff where so busy talking in there own language we had to wait until they had finished very rude and when we went to eat we where showed to a normal table i did request a table for handicap on the application when booking we went to deck to smoke and could not get out with the wheelchair so we went to deck where again could not get out the ramp did not match the door some cm too short when we travelled out from amsterdam we went by stena line everything thing was completely different when booking we had the oppurtunity on the application to order a disabled cabin at a reduced price for disabled passengers there was automatic doors to the cabin and the bathroom with enough sockets for both beds large towelswith soap kettle coffee etc tv and good shower seat and rails and no problem getting out to the smoking decks we are travelling again in october and i can assure you that we will travel stena line even if it means driving a few hours more to get to the ship it will be worth it dfds ships are too old and need to be updated its like stepping back years we used to tavel from esbjerg to harwich times a year and unfortunately we have to go via holland or france
newhaven is a lovely port to sail from and the ferry trip is an enjoyable interlude before our holiday
getting on and off as foot passengers was a pain particularly the long wait for the luggage at dieppe there were lots of foot passengers and lots of waiting thankfully it was not raining or too cold ferry journey was very smooth and staff very pleasant on board
the onboard facilities were good including food and plenty of seating i would have given a higher rating if the advance information as well as the port facilities for foot passengers was better for example there is no shuttle bus from the ferry to the train station in dieppe and pedestrian access to the station at newhaven is not signposted
very smooth our first time using the dover calais route and it was very simple will use again
i was very satisfied despite the fact that there was some nonsense with booking and payment but our case manager nora fixed everything and was very helpful this saved the whole situation and left me very satisfied the fact that she met with full understanding of my frustration thank you very much
i had to cancel my trip which was only months away due to circumstances but to my surprise i had to pay of the total costs such high cancellation costs can at most be justified if dfds is actually unable to sell the tickets for in four cancellations however if dfds is able to fill more positions as usual which seems more than logical to me given the two months interval it is an ethically irresponsible and exorbitantly high amount that does not belong within a corporate responsibility code of conduct
had two wonderful crossings from ijmuiden to newcastle and back delicious food and fun things to do on the ship next time a larger cabin with two beds on the floor but otherwise everything fine
nice clean ship i always use this route but could you get the french to put more staff on same for the newhaven end it takes ages to get offloaded
excellent service with great customer service i had booked the boat incorrectly and could no longer cancel it according to the site but thanks to very helpful employees this could be changed without extra costs we were also a bit earlier on the return trip and were able to take a boat earlier a really great experience with this ferry service
the onboard experience was good the choice and quality of the cooked food was excellent the seats were comfortable this was the first time we have used this route and the crossing was reasonably priced on april however we sat in our car for around an hour waiting to disembark in newhaven by the time we cleared passport control it had taken one and a quarter hours to get away at the end of our journey this would deter us from using this route again as we would have arrived in the uk earlier if we had driven to calais from dieppe
great staff helpful welcoming polite and just great people information on nord was good however i would have loved to have some earlier information about the how do get off and when to enter your car part a we will inform you when to go to your car around would have been great room booking went wrong somewhere on the way and needed to be changed onboard so i did not get a doubelnde as booked room was noisy and old looking though very clean pet area outside was way smaller than i expected i guess i just had to big expectations on the trip as with a dog you are really limited maybe i did miss the great parts i expected to be off the ferry as i was used to on scots ferries where arrival time last one off the boat so for me it was okay for on the way but no great experience therefore i just felt a lot of money but again maybe i just have to high expectations
very helpful staff at ferry boarding point in dunkerque and the staff in the restaurant on the am sailing on were excellent also the breakfast was hot which is unusual on ferry services all round a very good experience
booking reference we were extremely disappointed to be charged for our very small bike trailer on the return journey from amsterdam the trailer was taken off the bike and taken into our cabin so did not take up any room up on the deck we have travelled with this bike trailer several times on dfds ferries and have never been charged a fee very disappointed and may not travel with you again also i tried to book four evening meals prior to the return journey but was unable to do this online and we therefore had to pay the full fee for these on ship
we always take dfds because for us they are the nicest to customers but we were not satisfied this time because they wanted to park us upstairs which is impossible with a camper van which has a long overhang without hanging the rear bumper i had to refuse to go up for them to accept as professionals they had to understand this i hope i dont encounter this problem again
ferry left on time both ways we were able to board an earlier ferry on the way out as we arrived a bit early at no extra expense plain sailing
both journeys to calais and from dunkirk were stress free friendly check and crew we missed the booked return crossing but accommodated on next crossing with fuss boats clean and all in all very pleasant
the speed of getting on and off the ferry was superb and speedy and the catering staff in the seven seas restaurant were truly outstanding
normally good service but this trip all vehicles left with drivers waiting to disembark in their cars for minutes without any explanation plus already mins late
dfds boats so much more better than po more comfortable and dcor more appealing food offering much better including fresh ground good coffee worth thinking about crossing to dunkirk for the return the port so much less busy than calais port
quick and easy to book the trip good over the phone booking good prices very professional ships company
good service in all respects not sure why we were requested to arrive two hours before departure when loading of cars commenced only minutes prior to departure good value for a five day return trip in april especially with the discount for oldies andrew salisbury
friendly helpful staff and comfortable facilities made for a pleasant journey both ways had forgotten headlight deflectors but was able to buy on board which was a relief dieppe is certainly worth a visit in its own right even has free parking on the seafront
i always travel newhaven dieppe because its such an easy route theres only one ferry leaving at any time so not loads of queues and the staff at both ports and on board are extremely friendly also the hour crossing gives you just enough time to relax before your onward journey
the ease of booking and using the ferry also staff were really friendly and cheerful this really helps
newhaven too hard to get to hours getting off at newhaven no seats on board all full duty free shelves empty lounge seats very uncomfortable dont recline much and no foot rest bad back unable to relax no cabins left no bar going out foot passengers got off fitst so takes forever horrid ferry never again
we arrived at port early and were offered an earlier crossing which was really good some good deals in duty free as well
have received several emails regarding a campaign with a discount on all departures for the rest of the year with the exception of the high summer period when booking before may after checking the availability of departures and having spent the last week taking time off work arranging everything around the trip etc we then go in to book our tickets suddenly there is only on the trip one way and full price the other way i call customer service today who says that there are no more quottickets with quot and there are only a limited number per person trip this is in no way clear from the offer i have been sent fair enough that certain departures may be sold out but it can clearly still be booked just not at the favorable price that the offer in the email otherwise promises applies to all departures so now were standing here with disappointed children who cant go anyway and we feel cheated we have otherwise gone many times before and had some really good trips but we really feel taken by the nose and dont want to spend time planning such a trip again if you cant count on what is promised after all in the campaign edited after response from dfds it is possible that it is written somewhere on the website but it does not appear in any way in the campaign we have been sent which i would claim is part of your marketing the only limitations mentioned in it are that the campaign does not cover the high summer period and that the trip must be booked before may we have dealt with both of these limitations and thus expect the offer to be valid on all departures as stated in the email therefore i maintain my criticism as all limitations in the offer should appear in your marketing
departure hours and minutes late with various reasons being expressed which didnt agree with the one explained once we had departed weighing the ship the consequence for me threw all my schedule out and effected many other passengers eg where was a toilet to access and i saw at least wheel chair passengers on the boat later tell the truth from the beginning would have been a lot better
we frequently travel on the overnight ferries and always take a berth cheap cabin they are more than adequate providing each of us a bed this crossing was a last minute urgent booking and the only cabin available a commodore not really suitable for adults to sleep in any comfort firstly my husband is over foot so longer than the bed the duvet provided was barely the width of the bed so not practical if single duvets were provided we could at least have managed to be covered although the spacious cabin was nice wed far rather a bigger bed without windows at the time i should have asked a crew member if a nd duvet was possible however i didnt the staff are always efficient polite and helpful
overall comfortable trip some explanation during check in or when leaving the car deck about our boarding cards being keys to our cabin would have been useful as would some signs directing us from the pet friendly cabins to the dog toilet area
we arrived to dover early and was put on the next ferry great service and friendly staff
firstly i would like to commend the seven sisters captain who when a storm was forecast in the channel april left newhaven minutes early thus missing the worst of it on the return journey the later arrival time in dieppe of the incoming ferry impacted on cars waiting to board as the arriving cars took over an hour to clear immigration in newhaven disembarkation for cars was delayed for no apparent reason we were pleased to see that immigration at newhaven appears to have got its act together and is much quicker i have been travelling this route since and it is my preferred ferry service
on the journey back to newhaven it took far too long to disembark and no information given really frustrating and something they can surely improve
a very pleasant trip from calais to dover we were able to park as requested next to the stairs excellent service in the premium lounge
we were even allowed on an earlier crossing convenient chairs on deck always enjoy the two hour break on our journey home
good loading and unloading so out of port by min of docking very pleased with newhaven operation will use as best way to visit france
we did the sailing from dover to dunkirk wonderful trip and the full english breakfast was fantastic and delicious staff onboard were very friendly and helpful making us feel welcome as soon as we were onboard the ship was clean and tidy and would recommend dfds to everyone
the trip was completely ruined by our group losing both the booked cabin type and the show no attempt by dfds to correct the error we will fly next time and you should too
the checking in was perfect and the lady was very friendly we were offered dunkirk rather than calais as an alternative as we were early which we took the crossing was very calm and pleasant we thought the breakfast was a little expensive but it was very nice
everything went smoothly from checking to exiting at destination
i used dfds for crossing from dover to calais and back on both crossings we were early and they put us on an earlier ferry at no extra charge loading and exiting the ferry on both was smooth and straightforward we didnt use any of the onboard facilities so cant comment on those although i was a bit taken aback at having to walk through the duty free shop airport style on the boat coming back all round a good experience
very clean ship on time both out and inwards crew very helpful breakfast very good smooth crossing annoucements from the bridge very garbled and quick and i could not understand wether they were in french or english on arrving back to dover passengers were standing in the stairwells and the lift was open but not going anywherecould be dangerous if there was any movement when docking but i would travel with dfds again
booked a cabin for the night ferry so we could arrive in france refreshed but arrival time brought forward and we were chucked off at am very tired and hours use of a quid cabin was a waste
all good no queues at dover departure on time smooth crossing swift disembarkation
booking on the phone was straightforward with one of your most helpful polite colleagues check in staff polite friendly due to early arrival we were able to sail on an earlier ferry whole experience was excellent in every respect b
ferry on time and plenty of seating i arrived on time and was parked in the very upper deck so significantly delayed getting off at newhaven cars that arrive later tend to get on last and off first dfds needs to sort this out
best ferry never have problems even late h all the time rebook straight for next available on board everything clean nice duty free shop and bar restaurant time on ferry flying so fast very happy all the time customer service brilliant too
very friendly helpful staff we travel regularly with dogs if possible it would be helpful if pet owners could be loaded quickly and together as delays boarding and disembarking particularly in hot weather causes unnecessary stress otherwise a five star service thank you
couldnt be faulted on the way back but my outbound ferry was cancelled and so i had no option but to book another ticket which was very expensive at short notice as could not wait for dfds to reschedule me
our sea view cabin was smaller than previous journeys it was also noisier it was difficult to sleep with everything vibrating in the room even on a calm crossing also when we parked the vehicle we could only exit on the passenger side which meant i had to climb over the central console at and not as flexible as i used to be this was not the easiest of tasks to undertake
the return trip on the th april returning back to the uk was absolutely fantastic i couldnt fault a single thing however the trip over from the uk on the th april was the worst travelling experience i have had to bare there were so many young boys on board unsupervised as the adults responsible for them were in the bars getting drunk the ships crew tried very hard to maintain calm and peace but it was impossible the boys were loud unruly and disrespectful of their environment and of the other people on board i ask dfds to never accept this behaviour from the adults responsible for all these children again instead of being afraid of offending these irresponsible adults instead think of the other passengers and the possible risks they may pose but to take better actions like example closing the bars until the situation was under control and the children were properly supervised if there were to be an emergency or a situation where we had to evacuate the ship i believe that many of these childrens lives would have been lost this may seem a little extreme but the children were behaving so badly i was afraid resulting in myself and my husband to retreat back to our cabin instead of enjoying our trip and the facilities the ship had to offer us the experience of that day and night is not one i would like to experience again while travelling with dfds
all went well apart from an email telling me that as i had changed my sailing i was having to pay extra i did not change my sailing and got to the terminal early and was put on the earlier sailing
we loved our ferry crossing the food was great and the staff were very friendly and welcoming
vessels themselves were fine but a couple of negatives on arrival at both dover and calais there wasnt much time allowed to get down to the car deck indeed when we got down there were cars already driving off on po it does feel that passengers are given more time to get to the car deck safely on our ship the new cote des dunes the pa system is really muffled and its hard to hear whats being said i think this is a design issue as ive experienced the same on the identical ships of stena line in the restaurant only one till was open leading to long queues and cold food
very quick and efficient boarding and getting off process and was delighted to arrive on time for earlier boat with no questions asked and just being allowed to board very easy and relaxing trip
the boat was late boarding and leaving which we understand is often out of your hands however we had priority boarding and were put into a queue which were then not boarded first
all good on last crossings good offered sooner crossing when available which helps everyone service good onboard shame the whole industry is getting so expensive may be better after next election if we get a change of government as pricing is deterring what would be regular passengers
customer service i understand that there are current difficulties in france at the moment but dfds cancelled a service on us and would not provide appropriate alternative however when escalated the issue was resolved satisfactorily actual crossing we took newhavendieppe ferry because it would be quieter and easier than dover crossings but it was very slow unloading even though the ferry was a small and far from full service on board was good and reasonably priced
super experience both routes were on time and very well managed it was a quick on and off the boat once we docked would absolutely book again
mostly as good as usual except it was a mins late departure which is in itself not so bad but there was no reason or apology given once on the boat we all understand that delays are inevitable from time to time but not acknowledging them is the worst part other than that great superb value great breakfast and a super smooth crossing disembarkation is always a bit slow but not bad enough for a game changer highly recommend and will always use
basically most of the trip was excellent but this is the second time the dover team did not send me to the priority boarding lane even though i had paid for it and the sticker was correct thank you dfds for your quick response and gratuitous refund
i bought alcohol from duty free at dunkerque on my return to the uk and i am sad to report that i was severely misled and charged incorrectly for my purchase the man who assisted me completely misinformed me on the prices and it was too late to do anything since we were about to depart for the uk the experience on the ferry was ok we were delayed and were offered complimentary drinks but the staff refused to give us passengers a drink each we paid for priority boarding but no priority was given to us we paid for the relax lounge and each time we went there to rest our eyes a little ahead of the drive back we found ourselves having to plead with people to stop talking and playing music it was a nightmare to be honest
newhaven very slow through customs and loading on to ferry poor much quicker and more efficient at dieppe very good toilets on ferry not very clean no hot water blocked unattended toilets
check in was very quick and there were no delays it was a pleasure and children loved it staff were lovely too we have been using tunnel last few years but it got so bad with all the delays and checks that we decided to try a ferry and what a difference that was highly recommend
there was more car space but lounge were not as comfortable as the calais route
we have shifted over to dfds from po after their appalling treatment of staff last year apart from less flexibility of crossing times in the evenings and having to travel from dunkirk which is actually fine the ships are really clean and feel far more looked afterwell maintained i would love to have more flexibility for crossings for multitrip ticket holders enabling to cross earlier if you arrive earlier etc i also would love to see in this climate of reuse and sustainable thinking water fountains to fill up water bottles at the dunkirk port below the duty free there is ample space there and i was really disappointed that there was only dispensers to buy junk food and plastic water bottles come on dfds you can do better than this i should add that a lovely guy called micheal who was working in duty free took my bottles downstairs and actually filled them for me amazing service he deserves real praise
the computer system at check in was down and we had to wait for hrs in the car with no information the cabin we were then assigned to was much smaller as usually and very loud as we enquired on board if we maybe were given a wrong cabin as we paid for the quiet one we were told the computer system was still down and they could do nothing we were given ear plugs due to the delay on departure we arrived much later and decided then to go for breakfast we usually dont as the kids dont eat much and it is then too expensive but as the cabin was too tiny with two children and two adults we needed to get out the boat was full and no room in common areas we had to pay full price for the breakfast and were not given the reduction despite asking for it due to the delay etc we are frequent travellers on this ferry and the service has never been as bad
my comments are based on the dfds route between newcastle and amsterdam on both king seaways and princess seaways i have travelled on this route many times firstly you could not ask for friendlier or more efficient staff this includes booking the tickets by phone required for pet travel checkin at both sides and the onboard staff online booking is also very straightforward ive only ever used the basic inside cabins and most recently the petfriendly cabins both are great comfy beds good shower towels are provided and there is plenty of space the petfriendly cabins have a huge window i thought they were well worth the additional cost dont hesitate onboard i highly recommend the explorers kitchen halfboard package booked in advance the food really is excellent its great value there are loads of options and you get more than enough time to enjoy it just note that your booking times are central european ie an hour ahead of the uk bar prices are totally reasonable and again you have plenty of options you can even take a drink from the bar back to your cabin to enjoy in peace on return occasions i have been across as a solo female traveller once alone and once with a dog and so this option was welcomed greatly chill out with a book or a wee netflix advance download bliss for those travelling with a dog the petfriendly cabins are great you have unrestricted access other than a short period early morning to allow for cleaning which is no problem to a decentsize area on the outside deck for them to go to the toilet you can even sit on a bench outside which is really enjoyable when leaving both ports or just at any point to enjoy the sea air there is also a dog hotel on board if you arent using a petfriendly cabin and i noticed that you can access the same area i wouldnt hesitate to use this option at all a highly recommended route and its obviously very popular book as far in advance as you can for the best deals
one hour delay getting on the boat as your systems went down
there was a delay of check in which made us leave hr late and arrive late the following morning into amsterdam
its a shame that the equipment is often not working play equipment broken play area empty tv not turned on a bit of effort would make the ferry trip more enjoyable
no problems traveling considering all the hold ups no issues experienced easy to board duty free shop at dunkirk seemed well stocked and priced only shortcoming was lack of catering facilities on board most closed and those that were open were poorly stocked
friendly lady listening ear solutionoriented and decisive we received confirmation of our booking by email during our conversation i had to my regret not booked directly with dfds but with direct ferries where everything did not go smoothly which made me doubt whether the booking existed dfds lady had to make some effort but eventually found a booking relieved that everything is ok my tip and her tip book directly with dfds and not via an intermediary site
as usual the check in was straightforward even though we got lost in the way to the terminal and arrived at the deadline of check inwe were last to board anyway all the dfds personal on land and on the ferry were very helpful and friendly very smoothly crossing
usual dfds stands and staff will only sail with them
this time the ferry was on time not cancelled no delay i have updated my number plate without any additional fees i am very happy for that the journey was as expected thanks
dunkirk into dover was a nightmare full of school children and so nowhere to sit when it came to going to vehicles a huge push at the stairs some one is going to get crushed as the stairs entrance is very small
our experience with dfds was that it was all very easy and efficient no issues facilities were good duty free drinks and food all fine as was seating area we were lucky with the passport control areas no queuing all took less than mins both sides no issues
we always go with you normally by car on this case for the first time we used two push bikes when i booked it never gave a drop down box with how many irish ferries do we booked in and found we had to pay ab extra each way this is terrible and upset our experience with you to get back to stars please refund this or tell me how you can warrant this amount of money i will try and inform others your web site needs to more clear
despite being one of the busiest weekends the checkin was very easy the staff were all friendly the ferries were all delayed due to the bad weather and all out if sync cars were being placed on the next available ferry we arrived at am caught the am ferry we find its much quieter to travel in the middle of the night or very early morning
easy boarding from calis to dover but dover to calis was problematic as the french was on strike only a hr delay tho
our crossing was on time and instructions were perfect staff on land and onboard were very friendly and helpful a very pleasant crossing
great checkin and passport control at dunkirk team on ferry very good
crossing was punctual all staff from call centre to checkin through to ferry crew were lovely
the que at boarding was well organised and we had a smooth crossing and been well informed thank you
freindly staff clean environment boat left on time smooth journey
incredibly bad experience forcing people to pay for a cabin where you cant find peace because of the noise from the ferrys entertainment take another ferry it is cheaper and without noise
this was our first time on dfds we arrived at pm at calais for check in for the pm ferry however we were not given a boarding ticket at all at the first check point we later crossed the two booths for border control the french and the uk respectively to realise that we dont have any ticket and had no idea which number line to follow somebody told us to exit the place and re enter again which caused a lot of inconvenience luckily we could still board the pm ferry in spite of getting a ticket for the pm ferry the second time we checked in but the whole experience was not very nice
great crossing comme dhab delays getting off at newhaven but this was due to uk passport control
unexpected guest on our sailing last night our cabin door was opened by either a passenger or a member of staff around am my family were all asleep but i had woken about minutes previously and was listening to the noise of the engine when the door opened someone male was looking in keycard in hand as they had just opened door i said hello and they closed the door and walked away my daughter sleeping above me woke as i said hello in a loud voice then the of us were awake wondering what to do i decided i should go to guest services to make them aware unfortunately there was no apology just was told it wasnt possible that it happened while i was there it came across the radio that the very incident had happened and it was a staff member with a master key who opened the door the security member was quick to deny this for some reason so he proceeded to give us cancel cards and new room keys and sent us back down i never slept another wink the entire night in the morning my wife went again to guest services where she was told they hadnt investigated who had opened the door but they would be in touch we are still waiting to say we arent looking forward to the return journey is an understatement im hoping to have a response to this before we return at the very least an apology not once were we told im sorry this happened perhaps a room upgrade or free meal even i look forward to your response still awaiting a response days later on the return trip our drunk next door neighbours were banging their door so hard i thought they were going to burst a hole in it they continued to shout until am certainly a memorable trip on the plus side breakfast is good
i had never used dfds before or newhaven port to dieppe but there were no holdups at the port the ship ran on time and the staff were friendly i will definitely use them again as on my return journey the ship ran on time and there were no hold ups like the delays that were experienced at dover with the french strikes that were going on at the time
on the ferry from oslo to copenhagen now we are people who share an incredibly worn cabin with bad air in it cabin where it is also impossible to sleep since the noise and shaking from the boat makes this impossible there is nothing to do on the boat but drink and eat quotunder parquot food the only good thing about this trip is that we have a car with us and we therefore choose to skip the boat home and rather drive through sweden even though we have bought a return ticket
staff very friendly and helpful because of disability our needs were met the cost of the sailing the ability to sail dover to calais return dunkerque dover met our criteria will definitely choose dfds again also cleanliness
reasonable comfort information given re reason for delay leaving dieppe due to refuelling appreciated sometimes difficult to hear announcements in general we will continue to be frequent customers definitely avoiding dover and all those problems have noticed more prompt and efficient checking in
boarding was quick all staff very friendly ship was very clean
no issues at all with booking boarding or sailing would use again
the sailing itself is fantastically pleasant and shopping in tax free is also fine and pleasant but seeing staff who smile has become a scarce commodity and then the worlds worst wifi signal it absolutely has not improved after the wifi packages have started that you have to buy them for for a kbh oslo return mildly to say miserable they work pretty much ik its almost fraud by claiming you get a wifi signal that works is mildly false its close to fraud i think i even take money for something like that miserable and when you approach the ship about it you get a strange almost arrogant answer that it knows shame and you cant do anything about it unfortunately but you can easily recommend buying it without problems or information about it doesnt seem like i mostly love taking the trips here but will never buy wifi again separately but i had a bad experience a long time ago in which i managed to get stars a very competent employee with you now you dont have to write names here just a different crazy letter this easter an employee whose name starts with mas answered extremely quickly and gave an incredibly nice of course compensation must also be included
smooth sailings and quick and easy check ins both journeys were quiet and so plenty of space to spread out
ferry nice and clean staff friendly however we turned up just after the recommended hrs before departure and despite being among the first to arrive at newhaven loading was done in such a way that nearly everyone who arrived after us got off the ferry before us at dieppe we then had to queue for ages to get out of dieppe port departure was late so all in all we spent hrs between arrival and departure and then it was nearly an hour to get out of dieppe not fair nearly doubles the trip time also why can the lights not be dimmed in at least some parts of the ship during night crossings
very helpful overall my son aged was travelling alone so it was very reassuring to know he was helped through security etc thank you just a small note that it doesnt say i couldnt find anywhere on website that said he would need parental permission crossing territories i bought him an adult ticket as being meant he was old enough and as its a first for me i wasnt sure what the process was i did call help line and they were brilliant with advice
very efficient entry and exit on a busy day but onboard information and catering was poor there were many families on board but all the children were nicely behaved and no one was being noisy however the announcements were impossible to hear so many passengers were unaware of the refectory closing at french time english time the staff were unhelpful and not concerned by the problem
i got there early and was very fast boarding no hanging around
very simple and straightforward from the time we reached dover to disembarking at dunkirk
nd time using dfds and very pleased there were problems at calais and so they switched us to dunkirk which was much faster loading and crossing was quick without any issues everything went smoothly and will certainly be using them again in the future
too many people booked for this trip and as a result we had to queue for over hours the most horrendous experience there were no toilet stops either we will never take the ferry again
we came in a car and despite many many buses that were delayed we went through quite quickly this was the disastrous first weekend of the easter holiday when hundreds of buses were delayed still are in fact so we had a relatively easy experience thanks only delayed by minutes each way
friendly and quick check in in dunkirk arrived minutes before departure and no issue booked relax lounge definitely worth the money would use dfds again only had a choice of two pizzas in the restaurant due to shortage of ingredients
buying tickets smooth transaction arrived in port with just enough time to get earlier crossing very friendly staff boat clean and tidy crossing smooth and uneventful
what went right departed on time arrived on time staff really good what was bad we had a dog friendly cabin deck not on same level as parking cabin was ok no complaints but the noise vibration engine i must presume throughout the journey was intolerable it was not possible to sleep it gave us headache it really disturbed our dog the bottom line is we tried this route as opposed to kent france to cut down the uk journey time in hindsight it was a mistake time on the road is worth the offset of a horrendous night on a ship
weve travelled on dfds quite a few times now and its always been a great experience however i feel ripped off this time due to a mobile bill for non existent data services from the onboard phone service this happens automatically as your phone roams to the onboard network and then quietly starts racking up your bill about quid for mb yes mb not gb even though you cant actually use the telenor maritime network for data and dfds sell wifi access separately this certainly cast a bit of a shadow over an otherwise great trip yes i know now i should have used airplane mode to avoid this but it certainly feels like this is a deliberate trapmoney making scheme
total lack of customer service due to illness we would have liked to postpone our stay by a day but only received a very arrogant response from customer service that they could in principle help as there was plenty of space on the boat but they did not want to help dont use dfds if customer service matters
easy booking easy rebooking via a phone call comfy ship good prices
unfortunately dfds has become so expensive that this is no longer an experience worth spending money on both expensive crossings tofrom denmark became much more expensive in the last two years as well as higher prices for the boat and the weak krone in denmark mean that paying several thousand for a wornout cabin with mediocre food and little entertainment is no longer a good deal once was lower the prices so that the price level matches the standard you have
we took the calaisdover ferry there and back everything went really well the staff were friendly and organized we would happily go again
i recently booked a trip with dfds ferry from france to the uk and was extremely disappointed to learn that they dont allow dogs on board despite paying for the premium area which is supposed to offer extra comfort and amenities i was still unable to bring my beloved dog with me this lack of consideration for pet owners is unacceptable and frankly ruined my entire experience with dfds its and yet this company seems to be stuck in the past with their outdated policies i would not recommend dfds to anyone who wants to travel with their furry companion
great staff service cabins bar and sea views but we had to wait an hour to disembark at newhaven not allowed early onto boat to dieppe to get some extra sleep maximum sleep in cabins seems to be about hours for overnight crossing to dieppe and that is followed by a hour drive in the dark before dawn breaks good prices suit many people though despite these drawbacks
good service when my crossing was cancelled because of strikes the contact desk were very helpful in finding alternative travel the boat was very comfortable even when crossing in a storm highly recommend dfdd
boarding was quick and simple food on board was very good got a good deal in the duty free crossing was smooth and we were off the ferry quickly at the other side
due to french strike action dfds had to cancel my crossing and asked me to change my booking to the next day they then charged me for the price difference between my original booking and my new booking same time of day just one day later outrageous they say that they can charge me because the ferry was cancelled due to reasons outwith their control but they were also nothing to do with me generally dfds are good but they have got this policy completely wrong
got an earlier ferry so went straight on no fuss so easy ferry was clean and quiet good food and a very easy sailing
really enjoyed our ferry journey to amsterdam the cabin was clean and the bunks comfortable best nights sleep in years wed booked the buffet in advance and thought itd be the usual pizza and chips but the food was outstanding only negatives were the bar staff were miserable being presented with the bill for our two drinks after the buffet and being asked how much id like to pay hed walked about three metres to get my three quarters of a pint and wanted a tip and the increased border checks brexit when we reached holland i know this isnt the fault of dfds but it took ages and to be honest was bad enough to make me consider flying to amsterdam next time which is a shame
through security and getting on the ferry was fast and stress free getting the coach to amsterdam and back to the ferry was also easy and zero stress id say i think the meals on board are a bit too expensive the price of alcohol at the bars was very reasonable but because the price of food was to per person we didnt buy any if food was a bit cheaper we definetly would have purchased a hot meal
very clean and pleasant boat staff all very helpful and friendly but disembark back in england was delayed as doors opened then reclosed for u disclosed reasons exit rerouted to a door with more stairs and bottlenecking minutes later than scheduled by time at passport control caused stress and extra expense due to delay in collecting my pets from boarding facility
tel no to call from denmark abroad is incorrect when you call for help in denmark to book a ferry abroad you cannot figure out how to send an email to our address however received an english email with a number that you cannot call from denmark here they write that they will reply in three days well we have booked with your competitor that was easy
you deceived me by taking my money for nothing youre very wickednobody advised me i asked for suspension of my travel as a result of my car issue and i will get back to you for the next trip bur you ignored it now you said there will be no refund thats fine i will make sure not to travel with you anymore
great ferry crossing to amsterdam very helpful and polite staff throughout the ship booked breakfasts and dinner and both were very enjoyable
ferries were on time clean and pleasant great value for money
the service was great very disappointed that i was charged an extra euros for being a day early very disappointing
excellent facilities the areas were very clean the staff onboard were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely be sailing with dfds again in the future
being parked on the quayside and instructed to board the seven sisters is a great feeling up to the instant of turning the ignition key and realising that the car wont start flat battery day saved and heart attack avoided by a dfds employee arriving within minutes with a van and jump leads ferry statistics include left on time despite my contribution excellent menu smooth sail on a stormy night docked on time finally back on uk soil a peaceful nights sleep thanks to the dfds motorhome stop just next to the reception building top class my choice every time
as always your ferry service is first class the services and customer services is amazing thank you for making my trip plan sailing
a nice crossing on a nice boat not the extravagant style of some ferries but fresh and comfortable and a pleasant crossing experience i was very pleased with the service and duty free and will use it again thank you
going to france would be a first car on first car off coming back dreadful one of the first on but the last car off it took hour to get off the boat
my brother and of his colleagues were travelling home from work on the ferry from amsterdam to newcastle last night when security guards brutally attacked them they kicked two of them down stairs and followed them back to their room where they dragged my brother from his bed they handcuffed their wrists and restrained their ankles and took them to individual cells where they were further assaulted they were told to keep quiet and theyd be allowed off the ferry they went straight to hospital and the three of them have severe injuries rest assured we will be taking this as far as possible absolutely disgusting
we arrived at the port earlier than expected and were offered to be put straight on the next available ferry the duty free shop at calais looked impressive from the outside but we didnt run in as we didnt know how much time we had until boarding
staff were friendly and helpful during a particularly windy crossing vehicles were loaded and disembarked efficiently making for a smooth transition and onward journey will definitely use again
where do i start lads who work abroad and travel back and forth every week had their room door kicked in by the companies drunken security and physically dragged out the room by the feet one passenger had his feet tie wrapped and beat up and put in a cell all night this passenger was lying in his bed asleep while this took place the police have been notified of this incident and the year old is currently in hospital for treatment disgraceful behaviour by the companies members of staff i have no doubt they will remove this review as this company dont want you to know what is actually going on in the ferrys
helpful staff our car wouldnt start after our crossing and we were soon helped so we could be on our way
not enough outside deck space to enjoy the sea air what was available was spoiled by other passengers smoking in the non smoking areas the crew did nothing to strop them and it spoiled the experience you need more open deck space as this is a big feature of using the ferry over the tunnel food was good and very enjoyable and the ferries are clean and comfortable much prefer travelling to dunkerque than the calais experience
simply amazing we travel from ijmuiden to new casle we love the hospitality onboard friendly staff and very helpful theres enough things to do for children and adults food are amazing we have simple room for me and my years old son for a cheap price passport control took a bit longer than expected but its not the fault of dfds some problems with the lift but we got instant help i would surely recommed this to my friendsoverall its an memorable trip
ferry clean food quite wide rangestaff friendly and helpful the embarkation and disembarkation are seeming to get better in the past the length of time waiting to get off the ferry seemes interminable
minutes delay on a minutes journey is not acceptable regardless of the winds
i would normally give you stars but on yesterdays trip we were not offered prosecco on outboard or return journey despite paying for premium lounge for us both joan
we booked a special offer day return for yesterday and could not travel as i explained in my chat to you due to the funeral of the mother of my childrens godfather we took my year old mother to this funeral i asked for a refund and was told this was not possible i tried five times on line to amend the system was not working there are no more fares at the same price and the alternative price requires an amendment fee of each way is the price in almost all sailings i have taken a number of school trips on dfds great crossings for the battlefields in belgium but your company has been unhelpful and mean a refund would be great but a rebooking would also be fine but on a day fare special offer to charge almost double just to amend then there be no similar fares and we looked to beyond the summer season but booking was not possible is all very disappointing it is not a way to encourage faithful po travellers
unfortunately we didnt travel due to unforeseen circumstances you refused to issue a credit note or a refund so we feel really disappointed with your company
the staff at newhaven were having system problems when we got to the port but dealt with it very well
when we phoned your office in dieppe everyone was friendly and helpful however when we got to the ship at newhaven everyone was rushing and not so friendly we didnt feel welcome and at dieppe we were rushed off the ship and they were glad to get rid of us so it was not a happy experience sorry to say this but it is how we felt good bye
i tried to ring to book a crossing for the sale day to obtain over s discount which is only available for phone reservations the first call was at pm on tuesday a recorded message was played telling opening times of am to pm after this the line was cut off i tried several times and used different numbers but the same thing kept happening i had no alternative but to book online without the discount however the booking in reception at port and crossing went very smoothly and was still good value for money
staff was helpful the crossing was quick and easy also the booking website was easy and straightforward to use
we booked a football trip with two ferry dates through dfds after the english football association postponed the match by one day we wanted to postpone the ferry date for the return journey by one day as well this was rejected by customer service annoyed as the booking system did not allow this despite objecting that we would take care of the additional hotel night and all other transfers and organization ourselves this was not made possible the only option was to leave the stadium immediately after the match and be taken to the ferry despite several free cabins on the ferry the following day there were no rebooking or other options that dfds could offer customer service reacted very annoyed on several occasions and sometimes gave different answers cancellation and subsequent rebooking was possible we were promised a call back several times but this never happened we had to wait in the queue times over several days before we were given a final answer and were told to contact various services english and german customer service unfortunately they were very unaccommodating and inflexible even though the problem should arise regularly a very disappointing outcome and so you are deprived of the experience of the english football atmosphere and the subsequent celebration in the city before you even travel and the stress starts during the planning
great crossing both ways friendly and helpful staff the ferry was clean and had plenty of space to rest on the overnight trip to dieppe and the prices onboard are correct in the restaurant and cafe all in all a great first trip with dfds
whilst embarkation was smooth i think shutting in servicis like restaurant and shop less than an hour after sailing tends to leave people in limbo even on a night sailing
had a really great trip loved the ferry all staff were extremely helpful passport control took a lot longer than expected but this isnt the fault of dfds we only ended up with hrs in amsterdam cabins were nice and clean and facilities were good food was good dont think it was worth the amount you pay for it though but youre stuck for options fill up in amsterdam
too many queues which could very easily be avoided queue to check in was unnecessary disembarkment at amsterdam was an accident waiting to happen with so many people in one area huge queues to get through passport and too many people kept back on the ferry in such a small area check back onto ferry was unecessary
we paid for priorty boarding and didnt get it at all we sat waiting for lorrys to load first never happened before and were given no explanation dunkirk to dover sailing at dover once again was put behind two cars of people with national statitics who were let off then we were stopped waited for quite a while then let off along the motorway was still passing trucks after miles from same ferry then the car that was let off first
we were delighted with our recent doverdunkirk return crossing the ferries were exactly on time staff were all extremely professional duty free shop very good value restaurant food excellent
i arrived a little bit early for my trip and the checkin staff said i would be brought forward an hour which is great and i was very pleasantly leaving on a ship that was at the time minutes early and had a good smooth crossing
out of for dfds staff sorting out the problem i created by putting in the wrong dates for my trip to amsterdam on the trip over we were allocated both lower bunk beds this was fine but on the way back we were allocated bunk beds for a year old this was an experience that was completely new to me and hope to never experience again through the night i had to go to toilet which happens to people of my age and nearly broke my neck the on board food was not bad though i found that it being an open buffet there were a lot of greedy people on board the transfer from amsterdam to city center was fine but the transfer from amsterdam to the port was a disgrace the driver would not take the responsibility of checking our tickets he kept on saying he was waiting for an organiser who did not turn up people were standing on a busy road and he refused to let people load their luggage or board the bus by this time it was about and the boat was leaving i believe the driver who was on bus he came up and checked all our tickets to let us get going i asked the driver bus why he driver bus could not have done this to start with he looked at me looked at driver bus and shrugged his shoulders in a way apologising to us for the drivers behaviour
our trip was subject to delay due to industrial action in france we were very impressed by how quickly you sorted out the problem by rebooking us from a nearby port ferries used by dfds are in much better condition than those used by other companies we have used
really enjoyed travelling with dfds felt welcomed on board ferry was very clean and staff were really pleasant
i take this ferry regularly i find staff to be friendly the food is mostly good the sailings are punctual the booking and boarding processes are efficient there are some genuine savings to be had in the duty free on the ferry although i didnt use it this time the lounge is an excellent option
route was changed and was late to leave ok but not star
the pm bus from amsterdam to the ferry didnt show up so when it got to and the last time for check in is we had to get a taxi which cost there is no easy accessible contact number the taxi driver happened to find one which we rang and were told the bus turned up at
on the th we should have been from oslo to frederikshavn on the th in the afternoon i get a text that the departure has been cancelled one of us has a medicine pass and only medicine for the days in question we choose to meet for departure in oslo and are rebooked to copenhagen we had ordered and paid for an interior commodore cabin but are apparently being downgraded to a regular cabin i found this out when i inquired at reception i was told that there would be a refund but i have not seen anything about that
receives saturday at a rather inadequate sms that our departure oslofrederikshavn has been canceled on sunday due to weather conditions dfds cannot be contacted as it is the weekend and also does not respond to emails sent no information on website or twitter on sunday on the way to oslo we finally get hold of an employee as they say they have twice tried to contact us by phone but we have not received a call so they have given up on getting hold of us even though they also have our email in their system we are informed about our options either one about booking for kbh or cancellation if the booking would mean that we could not come home and look after our job on monday and they could also offer us a downgrade on cabin we had a person cabin oslofrederikshavn but was offered two person cabins oslokbh i wonder if the transition was overbooked since that option was no longer available we chose to cancel as we had to go to work on monday morning this meant more consumption of fuel times brobizz our journey home thus became more expensive than the amount refunded the last evening of the holiday was spent speculating about how we were going to get home if we could not find any information we could not plan another return journey eg book another crossing so general lack of information which we are very unhappy with
you have sent an sms canceling our departure between oslo and frederikshavn at on march with the weather as an excuse strange enough sailing in oslo copenhagen there are reports of msi in frederikshavn so it shouldnt be a problem for you so what weather problems are there we got the cancellation at less than hours before departure hours after cancellation we havent received any more info so when will we get more info the next departure oslo frederikshavn is in days so what do we do im going on a business trip on monday afternoon so i need a quick answer why cant you be called at the weekend when you cancel our trip there is no information available on your websitecustomer service bad information and bad i cant get in touch with you ps hours before the scheduled departure we were called by dfds who could offer us a departure home days later but we had to pay for the hotel ourselves since we couldnt wait days we took the bus to gothenburg where stena line could sail us to frederikshavn since they had no problems with the weather
dumps in the car never travel with dfds they cover the ferry so you cant get in or out of your car its simply bullshit that the ferry is overcrowded so you have to put up with the car getting dents when you sail with dfds the cars kept so close that there was a whole row more than the yellow lines in the floor were intended for such bullshit the result was that no one could get in or out of their cars and our car got dents and scratches from people getting in and out never travel with you again
why not contact us when the ferry is delayed by hours we use you all the time and normally great but not today delayed then i would understand but at least contact your customers like airlines do so we can enjoy another hour without waiting i am not happy at all and should have flown for cheaper it is now no answer from customer service and still waiting to board its not on at all you are never as bad as p and o for sacking their staff so the ceo must wake up and smell success if their ferry service at least runs on time
thursday february on the way to ijmuiden checkin was quick small room super warm with a bunk bed bench and shower and toilet provided with towels no hairdryer prices are expensive both duty free and a drink on board buffet dinner and breakfast were fine cheaper to order online everything was there arrival in new castle checkout took hours to get off board strict passport control so hours less walking in new castle beautiful old town when checking in again on board there was some confusion as to which line to stand in so it can be better and clearer return trip was fine again no towels but they were provided at the counter quickly resolved friendly staff and a quick passport control in the netherlands upon arrival at home in the netherlands we were both struck down by a bad case of flu
generally a bit bad service and high prices we feel that dfds does not care about longterm highconsumer customers like us we get halfhearted indifferent and sometimes flabby answers from customer service over the years we have traveled many times back and forth between copenhagen and oslo with our children in recent years however prices have risen sharply you have to be lucky to get it exactly right when there is an offer otherwise it often runs into many thousands of kroner we have started to come up with alternative destinations dfds has simply become too expensive and bad unfortunately because we and our children are otherwise happy to travel with oslobden
desperate behavior during the storm lack of information lack of compensation for delays they say on the one hand it was safe and secure to sail in the storm but on the other hand they say that the storm meant that they could not sail as usual due to safety updated after their reply there was no information only on the day of arrival at oclock were you told that the ship would be hours late the reason was not safety the crew stated in other words your justification for securitynonseatability is unfortunately incorrect we have lost about half a day skiing increased costs as we eg missed lunch and received dkk in compensation for this
we have lost a gift card for dfds and it is naturally our own responsibility nevertheless dfds customer service chose to help us with a new one so that we can set off on the trip we have been looking forward to sublime and beautiful service we are very much looking forward to sailing with them
this is a review with somewhat mixed feelings first the good the sailing trip to and from oslo was absolutely fine the staff in the restaurants were very friendly the food was good everything was neat and well maintained we sailed home during the storm otto of course not without worry but it went perfectly fine and in high spirits i called both customer service before we left and also spoke to some staff along the way i felt quite safe on behalf of myself and my family dfds has it under control so to the negative it seems that there has been too much trouble in the shipping company the fact that you now sail past frederikshavn back and forth probably gives a little more money in dfds coffers but it also costs the time you can spend in oslo it is also a bit strange that you have to leave the ship in the morning in oslo and can only get back to your cabin when the ship departs from oslo again in addition it also costs quite a bit if you want internetwifi on board dkk per phonedevice for the entire trip most families probably have to factor that into the total price finally and probably the biggest appeal from here why does dfds brag about having quottaxfreequot when the prices cant be compared to the prices on land in denmark it is quite a disappointment to inspect perfumes and edt in the taxfree market again only to find that the prices approx is higher on the ship than if you buy it from most internet shops in denmark it smells like a scam and that kind of thing doesnt sell tickets with me
a sad story throughout my life i have been on the kbhoslo ferry quite a few times but it is downhill loved sitting in oslo and looking at people shopping in oslo dutyfree ferry sweets and fun disco dasko and a little smart drinks at a reasonable price family fun above the norm but from a nice family trip with a packed lunch ferry fun and a little cheap family buffet to exclusive luxury travel quotand here you are not allowed to eat your own foodquot but in return you can give us your first born for food and drink at our luxury restaurants by the way we have removed all tables and chairs so if you want to play cards or games you can sit on the floor or go down to your cabin by the way the same place as you can sit and eat your brought food quotif you have brought itquot duty free why when you can buy the same product cheaper on offer in denmark the wine on offer in general grocery stores so adults and two teenagers round trip with food and drink in restaurants or cafes hours duration is equal to the price of a flight to a warm country days with minimum half board if you choose a cancellation then you get a full pension i think it was our last family trip to oslo with dfds sad when you see the advertisement with lots of photos of mother father and children but you just dont feel quite welcome anymore the staff are super sweet but the concept has taken a boring turn i think you have forgotten quotyou are a ferryquot and no i dont want to go back to the time when the ship was loaded with drunk teenagers who were floating in their own vomit on the stairs in the furniture and on the corridors but perhaps a gentle middle way should have been thought of dfds staff
we were a family in cars with children including a monthold who had to lie down and call the maritime administration only to be informed that it is the shipping company itself that is responsible for deciding whether the voyage is safe which we at all havent even found that it was friday afternoon at pm from oslo to copenhagen despite the fact that the stop in frederikshavn was cancelled why wasnt our ferry canceled too despite the fact that the resund bridge was closed for over hours we decided to drive with children and grandchildren for the hours it took home to denmark a very strenuous trip especially for the children it would have been appropriate to inform us in good time about sailing plans and not leave us in the lurch regarding this and that the shipping company wanted to postpone the sailing until the storm had subsided so that we could have arrived safely but also late home yesterday saturday in the best way instead of like now pressured to drive myself just because of ussel mammon the ferry rocked nicely the week before the trip up to oslo so none of the of us wanted to sail during a hurricane and who has wanted to either eat or shop during this we have driven the whole trip to norway and sweden ourselves some years but otherwise enjoyed the trip also in the more expensive commodore cabins for which we have now simply thrown away lots and lots of money for nothing very poorly sold by dfds in any case here you have lost good customers for the future in our entire large family and friendship circle as well as association life after all we couldnt cancel our tripmove it we were told on thursday on the phone in customer service we contacted ourselves nor get it refunded bad bad service from dfds side if you look at your earnings on the cvr pages you can see that you had the best year in maybe it will be the same in but after that well you can guess there are probably many winter holiday guests who next time we do not want to advertise positively because of this experience and prefer a cozy hotel stay with dinner and coziness and or bowling and swimming and bathsaunagus outdoor spa etc somewhere halfway on the trip for completely different money than this expensive dfds quottripquot always costs in reality the scandic and raddisson hotels are not that bad at all but super duper around sweden norway and denmark etc should we just add and then there are countless other very nice accommodation options at very reasonable prices because its a holiday you haveright unfortunately it just doesnt feel that way with the oslocopenhavncopenhavnoslo ferry with dfds anymore
dear dfds it is under all criticism that you do not take storm otto seriously we should have sailed from oslo on february at but even though we have paid approx dkk for the trip for seven people so we have chosen to drive the trip through sweden by car all other ferries have been cancelled including color line which has canceled departures with people larvik line has cancelled even dsb has canceled trains in north jutland and maybe the resund bridge will be closed repeated calls to your customer service only result in the message that it is quotsafequot to sail yes but with the price we pay it must not only be safe but also comfortable it would be if you postponed the departure until approx saturday at and first hit kattegat on saturday at at least if you can trust dmis wave forecast but it has been impossible to find out what you wanted to do and with children in the company we did not want a repeat of other sailings in rough weather with you i think it would suit you to announce clearly how you handle the situation and in what high waves you plan to sail is the schedule or the experience more important give the passengers a free choice based on your information so that you could either choose to sail with them or get a replacement journey at another time perhaps there is an insurance that covers this otherwise there might be a need to make one
after years of traveling to england with dfds it seems not to be the fast way anymore the ferrys are delayed more and more lately today we had to wait until before going on board while the scheduled time was at this moment we still are waiting to take off maybe we will try the port of calais next time
traveled with dfds oslocjbenhavn now feb it really should have been mentioned that it is then a holiday from schools in denmark under booking it was not possible to use the poolhot tub as there were so many children and an insane noise level elsewhere on the boat there were children running around and playing havoc i dont mind children but this should be a nice trip for me and my girlfriend the only place to retreat to was the cabin but there we didnt have any internet which was supposed to be included in the price comandor so thanks for days with nrk on tv and a h life in restaurants and bars never again
bought a voucher from dfds for a mini cruise to newcastle via holiday auctions there was more than sufficient availability and we immediately booked the trip after which we received a reservation confirmation from holiday auctions when we provided our name and address details to dfds a week before departure we were told that our travel dates were not available after much effort we were able to contact holiday auctions by telephone who claimed that our trip had been confirmed because the reservation had been made via their website in the dfds booking system we contacted dfds again and they told us that a confirmation from holiday auctions has little value as long as dfds does not confirm the trip and that all travel dates are full in the coming months no further alternative has been offered by dfds holiday auction sells vouchers that must be paid well in advance if dfds can then sell your trip elsewhere for more money just before departure you can take it both dfds and holiday auctions wash their hands in innocence while they appear to be conspiring at the expense of the customer this review has also been posted at holiday auctions
got free nhs ferry tickets as a thank you for being on the front line over the pandemic however had to postpone our trip due to ill health but they wont let us because the deadline was apparently end of bit unnecessary im sure they could accommodate it if they wanted to
in november i did a mini cruise with dfds princess seaways from ijmuiden to newcastle we had paid for x dinner buffet worth in explorers kitchen online in advance once at sea there were high waves that made us seasick and ultimately we were unable to enjoy dinner we immediately told the crew that we were too nauseous to eat anything the crew informed us that we should contact them upon return so that we could request a refund for the unused dinner there was then telephone and email contact with customer service whereby we will not receive a refund with the accompanying illogical explanation quotrefunds will only be given if they are canceled hours in advancequot if we could look into a crystal ball and see that high waves were expected and that we would get seasick we wouldnt have even booked in the first place so far our holiday that we had to wait a long time for and have had to work hard for since years after covid after a few months and a lot of contact with customer service we still received the full refund alls well that ends well
as a family we had booked an ordinary cabin with bunk beds we later decide to rebook our cabin to a commodore cabin with a sea view this cabin is under the premium category where you can read what it entails by looking at the small information box here it says among other things that it includes access to the commodore lounge unfortunately we have to inform you that exactly our type of cabin does not contain this lounge nowhere in the information box does it say that our type of cabin differs from the others customer service is not helpful in any way the first person i spoke to couldnt even give us our old cabin back at the price we had paid at the time but the man i spoke to could so perhaps the helpfulness depends on which employee you get i have a queasy feeling that i have bought a product under a false product name they acknowledge that their communication is unclear but that they cannot help us which is just basic sloppy service their poor communication is their problem or so it should be update dear mathias you are not right when you go in and rebook your cabin it doesnt say what you point out otherwise it would have been nice if you were right then i would have avoided a lot of wasted time with your customer service we chose to upgrade our cabins regardless and when you consider that your prices are at the level of dangleterre it is a tacky product to sell however i would still say that both a commodore dlux and commodore balcony are significantly better than the alternative but then again what isnt a very good day to you too mathias
disappointed by the way they dealt with my dunkerquedover booking i booked my ticket online paid it and arrived on time to take my ferry i arrived hours before the time of my booking which was initially pm so i could embark on the previous crossing departing at pm for free as previous or next are included for free in their basic price but then at the checkpoint cabin where they hand your ticket on arrival their system started to ask me for another obviously it was a mistake but its at least the second time it happened in my history of travelling with them i had to park my car to go to their office for them to correct the mistake as the lady in the cabin could not help waste of time stress for all the family fear to miss the ferry due to the time needed to fix the issue awful
never travel with dfds if you have epilepsy the staffs position is that if there is even the slightest chance that you might be at risk of having a seizure then you should stay in your chamber for the entire trip you must not leave the chamber even at meal times deeply deeply unprofessional you should be ashamed
we have booked a return trip to norway by car for people it was dkk our friends also consisting of people have weeks later paid dkk we call customer service and they wont redo it unless we cancel its just under all criticism really some bullshit all of us are considering canceling the trip and driving to norway instead the second is completely unacceptable
my husband and i are very upset that last week we booked an expensive ferry trip to oslo in july and two days later received a targeted advertisement on social media stating that the trip we had just bought could we have got dkk cheaper campaign with free car we called customer service to see if they could help us as large companies usually want to provide good customer service in such situations customer service did not want to help and complied with dfdss conditions where you had to contact within hours from the time of order to have the journey changedcancelled we contacted customer service hours from the time of the order and we are talking about a trip in the summer holidays we also asked if dfds could compensate with gift cards for the trip but dfds was not interested in helping us as customers dfdss response was that we could have just looked under their offers tab before we booked and then the offer would be available oddly enough the offers do not appear in the search tool on the front page we are also surprised that the offers are not activated automatically when you try to book your trip or at least appear on the front page of the website it seems as if dfds is trying to hide offers in this way so that customers like us end up paying full price all in all a bad review of dfds and we cannot recommend dfds to anyone due to their customer approach and rigidity after dfds answer we are not interested in an explanation but really just that we get the dkk back that we paid too much for our trip and of course all customers are interested in discounts that was a foolish formulation
dont consider taking your dogs if your not wealthy i was recently quoted just under k for a return pet friendly cabin from newcastle to amsterdam this is insane theres also no option to not have a cabin really disappointing they also wont give you prices online to force you to call
i got completely ripped off when i cancelled my booking when you book the tickets no where does it state that the booking is nonrefundable its absolutely appalling that you should lose all of your money if you cant travel even when you go to cancel the booking no reference is made that you will lose all of your hardearned cash its disgusting that dfds dont make this clear and you have to troll through pages and pages of terms of conditions to find that the tickets are not refundable i will never travel with your company again
it is a bit of a shame that you cannot cancel on the same level as regular bookings when you book with one of their offers so it costs of the journey price to cancel rather than and yes i know it is stated in their quotterms and conditionsquot but the point of this review is that it is very unfortunate that they will not refund anything at all just because you have used one of their offers its something like this that makes you not want to use a company again
i had booked the offer quottake the car on a ski holiday with a discountquot the car was obviously not included in the price i had paid but had to be added afterwards even though the receipt said both quottransport tripquot and quotcar discountquot when you choose such an offer you must be aware of going to the first tab called quotfind travelquot even if you are sent directly to the quotfind cabinquot page from the website it makes no sense to go backwards in a booking process when you have already chosen the date and number of passengers dfds has been made aware of the inappropriateness of their website but i can see that it has not changed therefore pay attention to whether your trip includes a vehicle too bad for those who only discover it when they stop at the ferry
we had great experience with the journey on the boat great stuff very helpful so comfortable journey
i have just had a really bad experience with dfds it boils down to the fact that i had to go on a return trip to oslo with the family i simply wanted months before the departure of the trip to change the date of departure and not cancel and it ends up that i end up canceling my trip by mistake their support then tells me that i cannot get my trip rebooked in any way and therefore i lose the entire trip with no refund of any kind for the ticket because i took advantage of a socalled quotofferquot nok straight out of the window even if you answer the phone within minutes of cancellation i thought it was strict that you cannot provide a better service when you can clearly see that an error has occurred and it is also a very misleading cancellation method on the website as you cannot see an overview of what to cancel we are a very disappointed family we have often used dfds for weekend trips and in the past we have been very satisfied but after this poor treatment i strongly doubt that we will ever use dfds again
dfds claims on their website worlds best ferry operator website but i have to say that my experience was the worst ive ever had shopping on the internet extremely frustrating and fraudulent experience here is my experience going from being extremely frustrated to feel like im being robbed as i finally am about to make my booking as a registered user trying to make a booking they ask you to register using your email address after which i get told that its already being used given that i never created an account on their website i have no clue what the password may have been set to as i try to reset the password i wait forever to get the email needed to complete the password reset i check my spam filter on both my email account and my email client and there is zero trace of any email being sent to me i then try calling the phone numbers provided on their website to get assistance but no one ever picks up keeps on ringing until it runs out tried both my residence country code of and for denmark immediately disconnects i now try to register an account before starting the booking process which miraculously works however to my astonishment and dismay i now find that the price for the same booking prepared previously had almost doubled
not a company to trust i booked their ferry crossing from dover to calais via quidco and was due a cashback which they declined to give on a valid booking no reasons given why it was declined when there is no reason for declining i would not trust a company that lies for small amount they go on my fraud listavoid themi use po and they are always honest and prompt
good communication via twitter lastminute information and youtube channel arrival information we arrived at calais well in time hours in advance and were even able to take a boat earlier everything went smoothly take passports with you as this is now mandatory for england
my son was ill and we needed to delay our ferry to france dfds were so kind and helpful and made the experience far less stressful than it might have been we have always found travelling with them smooth and efficient with friendly staff and great service highly recommend
the staff on board and getting you on and off the ferry were great we did routes dover calais then dunkirk dover things ran on time for the way out on the way back there was a min delay however there were a few points that i think could be improved by dfds there was no decaf coffee or hot chocolate on the pm ferry dunkirk dover pretty difficult for anyone trying to avoid caffeine later in the day not a one off as woman in cafe told me they hadnt had any for ages on dover calais there was no play area and the advertised treasure hunt was no longer running on dover calais the toilet paper dispensers in over half the cubicles did not work for the whole sailing despite me pointing this out to the information desk mins in
we are very disappointed in dfds and its customer service i made an online booking for december from dunkirk to dover at pm outward journey and return journey on december at pm we received confirmation for december for outward journey at am instead of pm and return journey on december after calling customer service they indicated that it may happen that the system books an available time slot instead of what you wanted to book on the outward journey it was no problem to rebook to the desired time slot of pm but on the return journey we suddenly had to pay extra last time i booked dfds
the staff of dfds are very courteous gave us proper instructions as it was our st time and kindthe ticket has a lane number assigned do check that you board the correct ferry the premium lounge was worth the price if you drove for long and need some rest as they have chaise sofas clean and excellent seating arrangements there are snacks tea coffee alcohol n non alcoholic drinks to serve as part of the lounge service while you watch the blues n greens the boarding from dover to calais was quick around mins max we booked economy so you can board the one before or after the scheduled time we missed our schedule so we took the next one at good flexibility while coming back calais to dover first get dfds ticket queue then french border control which was quick and finally uk we were in the queue for nearly an hour due to uk border control systems down issues luckily we booked flexi so we were ok please give at least hours time as u never know as we reached hours early as we missed the due to weather conditions travel in the day as the views are mesmerising if you love the sea while off boarding it was quick but there are custom checks either you will be asked to exit or drive on top yi customs for final checks thanks dfds service better than flying
due to an accident at drammen where the motorway was closed we did not get to the ferry i call dfds immediately i can see we cant get there the message was its just a shame you cant get the money back theres nothing to do fair that the price for the cars and such is not refunded or given as a credit but neither can the food we had ordered an evening buffet and a breakfast buffet for people there were over hours until our evening reservation and over hours until breakfast what is the justification that we cannot get the money back great end to the christmas holidays
just booked all our travel for as we regularly use the newcastle amsterdam route and it is always such a pleasure dealing with dfds from joanne in their excellent customer services team to incredibly slick self serve online systems for example i love how when i make an online payment or update details such as our address the systems updates itself immediately and i can then instantly redownload the updated booking letters the ferries themselves on this route are always excellent too along with the service including during covid when it was so important for us to have a reliable means of travel thank you dfds bravo
my son and i were lucky enough to get a quick trip with dfds frederikshavn with crown seaways on november a wonderful trip with a nice and clean ship and not least the cabin and we had a lovely stay in oslo as fate would have it we got some good weather on the return trip and the ship couldnt call at frederikshavn at as planned we were instead taken to copenhagen which we called at this is where chief purser mikkel jensen took over fantastic for handling a lot of passengers who should have been off in frederikshavn where their cars were parked and much else had been agreed we all received fantastic treatment a huge thank you to mikkel we all came home safe and sound a huge experience richer also thanks to lauge in customer service who was responsible for the communication afterwards well done and thank you we will gladly take another quick trip if the opportunity presents itself
i just think its terribly bad customer service that no matter how early you are you cant cancel your trip confused about the lack of flexibility in general
the service ran exactly as timetabled and checkin was smooth the only slight improvement i would suggest is that as a foot passenger there was a bit of a wait outside for our luggage to be unloaded
hello dfds we have to postpone our departure on the oslo ferry unfortunately we have fallen ill can you move our booking to next week oh no you must cancel and order a new one okay then we have to do it unfortunately you lose a lot of money part why we refund per cent so i can repay dkk youre not serious so it costs me nok and a brand new ticket that we wont board coughing on christmas eve with positive covid tests that is if you have travel insurance but shouldnt i book a new ticket for you right away dfds has a monopoly on the sailing trip kbh oslo and has such harsh travel conditions it wouldnt cost them anything to change the ticket and an adm fee for that would be fair but this
we are very disappointed in dfds due to a problem with our passport we were unable to attend and our trip fell apart the site does not clearly indicate that a passport is now required in england were not the only ones who hadnt thought of that at all i think dfds is negligent in this regard and they should have underlined this in black when confirming the booking and should have indicated it more clearly likebe careful with your passport dont bring an id card there was also insufficient search for a solution we lost our trip and could not be rebooked money gone so people beware very unfortunate that we now had to swallow such a bitter pill were completely devastated that there was no solution or compensation it was human error on our part and the fact that they say without feeling that it was not reversible is very bad
friendly staff system was down at dover causing delays which led to us missing our ferry however staff were helpful and transferred our booking to the next available ferry comfortable journey overall would use dfds again
stay away from this danish bully company if they had spent as much energy on making orderly trading as they spend on removing negative reviews on trustpilot which can be bought there would still have been something rarely have i come across any more dysfunctional company with on top of it all a rude dane on the many and long conversations on the phone steer clear of this company if you want to avoid frustration which is also completely out of date in most respects sail with other companies and btw dear mathias ive spent enough hours on the phone and online with you now for an initially very simple request that dfds has to take on board because it doesnt work good tip lawdont market things you can comply with or vouch for if you want to get to the bottom of it you can manage if you want to find the information without having to ask for a booking reference which i havent even gotten as far as receiving because i spend hours on a ridiculously dysfunctional system you can find the details of prepaid travel via a third party not rocket science youre wasting my time so youll have to wait a bit too they also do not follow norwegian legislation and refuse to request the deletion of personal data as i still receive spam from them on emails among other things you are referring to english quotdata supervisionquot well you both sail and have an office on norwegian soil as long as you operate on norwegian soil norwegian laws apply you have also blocked me on facebook after i shared a link about hairraisingly bad cleaning from tv this is a company you should watch out for
all went smooth even as a first timer using the ferry to calais adequate number of staff guiding vehicles through process
the ship was clean and tidy well appointed and punctual shame the food was so expensive but the staff are lovely and very polite and we couldnt be more happy to be moved to an earlier crossing on the return home so all in all another win for dfds
crossed early morning from dieppe to newhaven departed on time at am nice smooth crossing comfortable reclined chairs to rest and reasonably priced restaurant on board found the crossing much easier than calais dover being a less busy port would definitely recommend to anyoneand use myself again
it is such a shame that those cars who arrive at the terminal in plenty of time are loaded first and placed onto the raised deck at the back of the garage allowing those who have arrived late to disembark first from the main garage deck we waited minutes before we were able to disembark after all vehicles had been removed from the main deck po allow those with dogs to be loaded to allow priority disembarkation i would have expected similar with this crossing maybe you should consider loading the cars in reverse order so those who ensure they arrive in plenty of time are rewarded without a delayed departure
have tried dozens of times to book a trip to newcastle things always go wrong when paying i have already sent an email times and had telephone contact but the trip has still not been booked
negative food and drinks overpriced and uninteresting seating uncomfortable public rooms cold no quiet lounge windows filthy so you can hardly even see out wifi only works intermittently as usual the arrival time is when you sight the harbour not when you can actually get off the ferry half an hour later and as always there is no logic to which queue gets off the boat first so there is no point arriving at the excessively early checkin times demanded really its like nothing has been learnt in the last years of crosschannel ferries except how better to fleece the captive passengers positive friendly staff at checkin also friendly welcome on board from a uniformed member of staff fast onboarding but then there were only odd cars to board
the check in and boarding were fluid the whole trip was stress free
ship left on time easy to board and disembark
journey fine but had to come back for an emergency and no phone line open or the option to change ticket on line
very easy crossing very rough but the cabin was comfy enough
always my first choice of ferries arriving to the port early by one day one is welcomed always by a friendly member of staff they offer for free a place in the parking nearby an old seaport town nice fish seller and some other tourist attractions also a nice swimming pool in town boarding the ferry is very well managed nice seating and a short crossing one doesnt need to think of sleeping a small shop and a quiet restaurant for hot food although i didnt eat anything thank you
we were able to change our crossing with no issues staff on board were friendly and welcoming
good price compared to eurostar disappointing experience at dover due to internet problems only impacting dfds despite issues we got on our ferry so all good
i had to give star because i didnt have any other option not to give any star we had a day trip to france on th december because the computers were not working we had to miss salling time so we took the oclock ferry didnt leave us many times to go to the lille xmas market and back it was very disappointing and my children were so upset
the ship was brilliant clean and comfortable on time with a smooth trip and staff very helpful would use them again
great boat good service getting us onto earlier one without having to ask very good prices and great duty free shop
the trip was great the food was really good in the explorer kitchen with lots of choice and plenty of availability the staff were all friendly and the service was excellent we really enjoyed the live band in the club and watching a film in the cinema on the way back the day in amsterdam was well organised with buses to take you into the city and back this is the second time weve done the mini cruise to amsterdam and have really enjoyed it both times we think the princess seaways is a better experience all round than the king seaways the reason for four stars and not five is the website is really poor and the way you make changes to your booking feels really clunky and complicated the data does not sync with the app and when you get to the terminal you wonder why they have an app as it isnt used
i have recently booked with dfds few days later i had to cancel due to the unforeseen reasons i cancelled the trip via the website and have not thought much of it after almost two weeks ive called them and asked about a refund they were really surprised as obviously they have cancellation fee she offered me travel points for my second leg as my first leg has already passed if i have not called i wouldnt even have an option of receiving travel points nowhere was it written i had to call them in the end i declined the travel points as i told them i moved and will not be travelling over the channel in the comming months all they said is nothing they can do all they do is what others do i had a better experience with ryanair who at least took into considerations the conditions in the past and gave me a refund when i was ill and could not travel would not recommend edit the link did not work for me says it is expired
had to return early for personal reasons on arrival at dieppe i was told that that days ferry was fully booked but i could get on if some one didnt turn up the staff were very helpful and did manage to squeeze me on at the last minute very grateful thanks
on time and efficient boarding on and off
fast embarking and disembarking we booked a cabin so stayed in there most of the time
friendly and helpful staff both on board and ashore very clean passenger areas
i have always given well earned good reviews and recommendations about your company however this last trip was slightly blighted because the ship required refuelling which added over an hour to the waiting time when bad weather etc causes a delay this is fine but running out of fuel i always make sure that my car has enough fuel prior to using it
we have not traveled with dfds since the start of the pandemic our trip over the past couple of days was great xxx
friendly staff clean ships punctual crossings great value duty free
excellent booking and crossing between dieppe and newhaven downside was time to offload from the ferry nearly an hour and it was not very busy
useless arrogant ignorant and pathetic that is being polite they done everything to make a perfect christmas visit to disney a nightmare we were returning to the uk on the pm ferry we got there in plenty of time the first experience we had was of a very ignorant woman at the dfds booth she just shouted something randomly at us which turned out to be switch your lights off then only to be shouted at again turn your engine off she took the passports then aggressively handed them back then shut the window she obviously had a problem with her printer as she was clearly hitting it and swearing at it she then threw the tickets at me wow dfds customer service at its best there is more we were sent to passport control which sent us back as we had a seven seater and so had to go through the coach area freezing cold children were dragged out of the car into what we can only call an interrogation area by uk border force who are adamant the can only process six passengers and everything else is a coach and dfds should have told us about this new regulation they were adamant it was dfds fault not theirs i have traveled for years with a seater passengers and never have i seen this this highlights dfds as an issue no wonder the ferry was empty people must must be complaining by not using them that certainly what i am going to do this was the first time using them and the last its back to po even with their issues they are a better company they have asked me for further details or trustpilot will delete this complaint wow they are that desperate to hide the truth that they would pay for this service i guess i have sent details accordingly
arrived at dover earlier than expected due to the weather conditions we were offered to go on the early ferry to either calais or dunkirk all staff were helpful throughout our crossing to calais we returned from dunkirk the ladies toilets were very clean and smelt of air freshener well done to all the cleaning staff
i have been involved in a lot in my life but we took the option this time to travel with dfds as we have a dog and driving hours via sweden felt a bit far but in hindsight i had driven hours instead the staff are extremely rude not helpful the area for dogs is at the bottom of all criticism the cabin had more bulk than a corolla in greenland mold in the shower and not very good cleaning there is a lot of room for improvement
our use of a cabin on this crossing was very poor before we got our keys i heard the reception crew member being quite offhand with another passenger come arrival at dieppe this same person twice invaded our privacy by overiding the internal privacy lock from outside opening the door slightly then latching the door open i closed the door and the same thing happened no more than mins later when my partner was getting dressed after a loud do you mind i again firmly closed the door after another mins the same person this time knocked the door after opening it i was told to listen received a lecture and was told i had been rude to her i dont think so the word privacy clearly meant nothing on top of that i got stuck in the toilet as the lock wasnt working from the inside the door stay had completely broken away from the door frame and the pillows were of a poor quality filled with lumps of foam regrettably a memorable crossing for the wrong reasons
all though i live near malaga i prefer to drive to dieppe for the crossing to newhaven as i have never had a bad service from dfds and i will sail with them in the future
the staff were amazing the costs although rising are very competitive my only criticism would be the boat is in need of refurbishing ie cutlery and furnishings
ive been quite happy with previous dfds bookings but on this occassion i found them to be inflexible unhelpful and rather meanspirited i wanted to get a credit note for a day trip that i was not going to be able to make due to a long awaited hospital appoinment and operation which clashed with my trip dfds were not willing to offer a credit note against a later trip but instead suggested i had to rebook the trip for another date this year and pay an admin fee as well i may have considered this noncustomer friendly attitued partially acceptable if it were not for the fact that having this operation was not a reasonable reason for not being able to make my trip
arriving in time for an earlier departure after an hour drive through europe and being allowed on with priority boarding was the best ever the food in the restaurant was great and all the crew we spoke to were very friendly i have made this journey many times pre brexit as my hometown is in germany but i live in norfolk this was one of the most pleasurable experiences right from changing the booking to leaving the ferry norfolk bound
nice company to experience the crossing to england just a pity that they allow children in the premium lounge who run around and scream and dont tell the staff and parents anything about it
good crossing but can improve on unloading car when arrive in port
the ferry was ok the good thing is that i was at the port earlier and was sent on an earlier ferry and thats good it allowed me to save a lot of time the service on the ferry was nice
they did know how bto dock a ship in dover mins
very easy route to travel from to punctual departure and arrival typical ferry food older ship but spotlessly clean courteous staff
crew on boarding were not communicative as folk got out of their vehicles and mainly elderly were confused on where to find stairswould a tannoy system be better
canceled departures every time someone tries to travel with you not worth the time to book should for example this evening have sailed from frederikshavn at it has not even arrived in frederikshavn yet the only good thing to say is that they are good at giving money back
quick and easy boarding onto the ferry staff very friendly and helpful good selection of hot food on board that was really good the day break ticket was really worth it hope dfds continue with this good service
pleasant staff on board ship food nice and clean seating etc the facilities at dunkirk port are much better than dovers for example the dover toilets that are in a portacabin are a disgrace id always sail with dfds rather than po why because po should be ashamed of them selves in the way they treated their loyal employees
dfds can you please supply me with an email that accepts incoming mail as the one linked in your reply to me doesnt work on our return from amsterdam my husband who is a mobility scooter user was more severely incapacitated than usual so we asked if we could have a wheelchair accessible room even though it was the same class inside cabin we were charged an additional euro we were parked next to the lift and the ramp was put down by one of the staff so that we could get up to our deck when speaking to customer services we were told that we would have assistance at disembarkation and that a member of the crew would accompany us to put the ramp in place a steward came into the lift with us but got out at level when we were going to level we were then left unable to exit as there was a step down to the car deck there were no staff on the car deck to help us and the lift was then blocked for other users i managed to find the ramp hung on the wall and put it into place myself this is not acceptable dfds can you please supply me with an email that accepts incoming mail as the one linked in your reply to me doesnt work
we had a great time on the ferry the staff were all lovely and friendly food in the bistro was great and we got to see a film at the cinema the rooms were small but exactly what you need will definitely take the ferry over again
i had booked my trip to norway with dfds from frederikshavn oslo on november and return oslo frederikshavn on november both departures were canceled due to the weather after reading through reviews on this page i can see that you write to a customer quotwhen we have to exceptionally cancel a flightquot twice within a week it certainly cannot be called exceptional if it doesnt take more than a strong windgale for you to be unable to dock in frederikshavn then perhaps you should not offer to travel between frederikshavn and oslo in any case i can not recommend traveling with dfds between frederikshavn and oslo if you want to be sure of your departure in addition you cover yourself under the force majeure and therefore do not cover the additional costs it has for your customers when they have to find alternative departures after sharing my experience i have heard others have had similar experiences
newhaven dieppe delayed by weather but no update by staff to queuing vehicles wandered inside and staff were friendly and helpful but why couldnt they pop out and update us on board the salon seats were very uncomfortable with the padding almost nonexistant sleep eluded me which was annoying as we had a long drive from dieppe
i have travelled several times with dfds and i am always happy the ferries are always very clean and comfortable i totally recommend travelling with dfds
not much i can say arrived at the port day early and asked if i can get the next boat and was told yes always travel with dfds
great and reasonably priced ferry service newhaven to dieppe good staff good food for the price comfortable bar and seats can be made better proper working wifi even if say extra each way would be great please fix toilet doors so they dont always slam loudly when people are asleep thank you
competitively priced day return dovcaldov clean punctual ferry hasslefree checkin loading unloading both legs caf a bit pricey coffees good trip
absolutely crap service with awful couldnt give a fcuk staff last time i use them itll now be with irish ferries or the tunnel in future oh and before i get your stock reply to contact you at customer services i already had thats why youve got the review youve got
quick boarding quick disembarkation friendly staff and crew
really nice mini cruise with dfds apart from shopped in sea shop and in that connection got to experience a new device probably an expensive one for dispensing tobacco products to get the goods i have bought and paid for i have to go to a completely different department where there are two large machines receipt must be scanned and the item must be handed over in the appropriate drawerhatch this is located close to the floor and is very deep so you have to dig down well behind the rather anonymous flap fortunately i am neither wheelchair nor crutch dependent but i didnt fix this the staff in the coffee shop next door were busy with their tasks and could not assist so i stood there and got more and more frustrated felt like an idiot and promised myself to never buy tobacco from dfds ever again luckily two of the cleaning staff came by and helped so i got my items kudos to them for that is it the authorities who have imposed this expense on dfds for a complicated dispensing machine and for safetys sake all the information is in english
i use newhaven dieppe route to avoid all that chaos in dover and it does just that efficient friendly helpful people make the trip pleasant
as a partially disabled man i depended on assistance from the crew the crew were not adequately knowledgeable about the best access to our cabin and although i asked for a cabin near the lift i got one as far away as you can get then i was told that i could take the stairs which is not possible for me pls note i specifically emailed dfds well in advance that i required assistance and i never even received an acknowledgement additionally we could not hear the tannoy information in the cabin or the walkways as a result there was total confusion on the ship ahead of disembarking in newcastle
we received the worst customer service with dfds the agent at the counter was so incredibly rude we walked next door to irish ferries and received excellent service go to them instead
travelled with dfds dover france and return very helpful staff and excellent service boarding and departing easy boat very clean first class thank you
excellent customer service they moved fast to fix an issue and are really responsive much more customer focused than po and the ships are much nicer as well
i always use dfds times a year dieppenewhaven because both ports are so easy to use and the ferry is comfortable with all the facilities i personally need booking is easy too and the ladies at dieppe always very helpful for any amendments
i have exchanged emails with dfds since i did this journey although the company looked into what happened staff lied about the incident and it appears nothing will be done about their behaviour i made two serious complaints about dfdss calaisdover crossing directions and signposting staff rudeness a combination of which almost led us to miss the sailing the signing from border control to the ship were nonexistent i spoke to other passengers who confirmed that they had equal difficulty in locating the correct ship only because i flagged down an extremely rude member of dfds staff who ordered us to follow his car were we able to get to the correct part of the port we were then given no clear information or directions the french staff in the port were highly disrespectful and unprofessional drive as fast as you onto the ship so you dont miss it was one of the comments i got out of my van and tried to have a conversation with these staff who refused to give me their id and acted like they might assault me i sailed with dfds from dover to dunkerque earlier in the summer and had absolutely no problems whatsoever that was why i rebooked and was so amazed at the treatment we received coming from calais
the boat was clean the staff were efficient and helpful and the boat left on time
good service but the waiting to get on and off the ferry is very tiring the passport control was very slow getting on board in newhaven as well
really very impressed with my first dfds trip ive always used brittany ferries but due to rising costs for a third of the cost and another minutes up the coast i thought it would be worth trying dfds and they did exactly what they promised at an excellent price will definitely be a returning customer
great experience we booked for the am dunkirk to dover ferry but arrived very early in the morning and were able to catch the am boat
we had a great crossing with dfds the staff were very friendly the boat clean the only thing i would say was that i struggled to find the correct ticket pricing for a day crossing when i entered my dates without going through the specific day crossing offer page it wasnt giving me the right price it was coming up with instear of i got there in the end something i forgot to say on my initial review my husband and i were really surprised when we saw a gentleman who works in the duty free help an older couple with their purchases bringing everything down to the car deck and load into their car we thought thats really good old fashion customer care
delayed docking in amsterdam took ages to get the passports control and then a minute bus journey to the centre ended up having hours in amsterdam what a waste of time price of food on board was a total rip off as well
we were an hour late leaving dieppe on the departure due to fuelling on arrival at newhaven due to car being placed on the top deck of car bays we were not released off the ferry till it took over an hour to back up trucks and get the ramp up to us on the top also from a point of view of catering and being a frequent travellers on dfds no curry has been offered on the fayre yet again
all staff on board were very helpful and polite the ship was spotless throughout and the toilets well maintained have sailed with dfds several times and would not hesitate to do so again the staff in the duty free shop were particularly helpful helping us to find what we needed and splitting the bill to use up our euros and top up in sterling many thanks to all
put us on an earlier boat great from start to finish
i was very disappointed with the extra charge to allow my son to get an earlier crossing i have been a regular user with a multicrossing ticket annually since dfds took over norfolkline and have never used any of the opposition travelling to our house in france since i didnt ever ask p o for a quote as i was always happy with your service i have been a day early one time as i put a saturday date down which was the sunday but no hassle when we arrived at the port i will think about using other means in future if this is not resolved regardsmatt
we arrived at approximately promptly as requested at hrs for the hrs crossing dieppe to newhaven we were placed in the first lane and were one of the first to board however it seems one is penalised for arriving with plenty of time as requested by dfds by being one of the last cars to disembark along with all the others who arrived promptly this is not the first time this has occurred and frankly does not encourage one to be early surely there is a way embarkation and disembarkation could be made more equitable i suspect the cars who arrived late were those who got off quickly
i have travelled a number of times with dfds this year but disappointed this trip only about the accommodation as we booked a cabin and had to go and swap due to sheets being dirty on one of the beds we were given another cabin and the same happened this time we were tired so took sheets off another bunk but also one of the other bunks was dirty too so lucky that only two of us were travelling this trip sometimes i have gone with my grandchildren
very easy crossings despite being a little windy much better and friendlier service above the waves than you get below in the tunnel plus better value for money wifi which works actually makes the slower crossing time advantageous as can catch up on work and breakfast too
fun on the ferry the check in check out was fast and the workers very friendly definitely will choose this way for next holiday
we travelled this summer to calais via dover late august returning mid september of the dfds ferry we go to the ferry port a little earlier and we got bumped to an earlier crossing giving more time in france on our return we did the same thing and were bumped again to an earlier crossing but what made this special was the ferry was almost deserted apart from haulage drivers we had booked the vip lounge and we were the only people in there omg it was bliss i would highly recommend dfds for ferry crossings the boats are immaculate and staff are beyond friendly super helpful please please please get the edinburgh crossing on asap
totaly disappointed with dfds on at pm from calais to dover they were not busy and they make people to wait till pm and they were saying they are so busy and some problems occurred the fact was that they were not busy and they didnt want to send the ferry half full and therefore make people waiting almost hours in the border where foods and other facilities werent available
this was the twentieth time that we went to england with dfds and back cabin in excellent condition breakfast varied and delicious service fast and helpful quickly on board and quickly off board duane in england had a minute waiting time so it wasnt too bad although that has nothing to do with dfds
i got there early and they let me get on a h early ferry no extra charge or anything great ferry service been using for years and always had good experiences with dfds
i arrived early both on the way and return an both times i was put onto an earlier sailing very helpful
really enjoyed the crossings both ways we were foot passengers and enjoyed the pleasant feeling of freedom to wander around the boat we enjoyed our breakfast followed by lunch on the way out on the th october and our evening meal on the way back on the th october there were plenty of loos available at all times the staff were exceptionally nice and friendly and did all they could to make us feel at home a member of staff even came to our tables on the return journey to collect our trays and our cartons i have a problem going down escalators with luggage because of a traumatic experience on the london underground a few years ago i explained this to a member of staff when he understood my situation he took my suitcase and put it on the escalator for me he accompanied me to the bottom of the escalator and then he held onto my arm the whole time we descended in case i panicked i will always remember his kindness thank you so very much there is no doubt we will use this route again because of the reasons above but mostly because of the kindness of the staff
friendly staff very new ferry great experience we have travelled on both the newhavendieppe and calaisdover routes in the last week and both went smoothly getting through customs at dieppe is extremely slow as there were only booths open for all the vehicles on the ship not the fault of dfds though
in general the ferry was good only thing that lets the journey down is the queuing to board the ship if your travelling by car
delighted with ferry service dfds was a po season ticket holder not any morestaff excellent facilities excellent vehicle access
the dfds ferry service is an important part of our life getting back forth the hours go quickly good restaurantcanteen nice duty free boutique comfortable cabins for sleeping and its a lovely cruise in summer when you sit outside on the deck i love it
new ship excellent staff perfect great crossing very nice premier lounge plenty of space in garage decks
hi there i have to give a start due to overcharge of the ferry was almost empty i made a mistake during rebooking as i entered a previous day however our original booking time different was just h but they asked us anyway to pay an extra which in current life cost is a little bit too much if we paid for full trip also amendment costed us extra so in total we paid more and the ferry was not full at all
unfortunately we missed our original booking due to the time it took not only getting from somerset to the docks but on arrival we were pulled into the search area on our motorcycles by customs which took the vital mins required to get checked in and aboard shiphowever we did get the next ferry dover to dunkerkque just glad that option was available thanks to the fella at the lanes barriercheckinalso friendly onboard staff and great ships thank you dfds
traveling with dfds was easy from making the booking to our journies outward and return trips from dover to dunquerke boarding was great and so was the premier lounge on both trips
easy and quick check in friendly staff on the ferry and good facilities
crew members dont work they job we was with baby and have the baby sign on mirror they put as all the way down with all the cars crew member was on hes bike and lead hes friends car to first go back from ferry and dont give any attention to otherpeople
the journey was as expected having travelled on this route many times before one suggestion is to allow cyclists and motorcycles on first particularly when the weather is inclement
i think the member of your team are very professionals helpful and answer to question with a smile the ferry was clean and on time my only reason i do not give a stars its because i cannot find a variation on price down i crossed in a private van when the ferry was half full
excellent dovercalais crossing we found email confirmations very helpful and booking was very efficient very straightforward crossing with plenty of facilities on board including duty free shop in both dover and calais boarding staff were very efficient and caring
we have used the ferry a few times now and thoroughly enjoyed each one very friendly welcoming helpful guidance and nothings the bother attitudes of all the staff we have delt with my only surprise was all transactions are made in euros but not clearly stated
the crossing was smooth and almost on time but the unloading was very slow we waited almost an hour after docking in newhaven to drive off the ferry
there was quite a considerable delay but absolutely no explanation or contact between staff and customer
the dfds team do a great job on the transmanche ferry its very reasonably priced and they do a good selection of food and drink at fair prices
friendly professional helpful staff clean ships restaurant good seats comfortable yes the features of the ship are showing its age but its still a good comfortable professional company we had for a good yrs been traveling on another ferry company whilst booking for them i couldnt get on so looked around and found dfds ive not booked the other company since
if you buy on board in the dutyfree shop of the dfds ferry as an offer note bottles of davidoff eau de toilette for only euros you turn out to get exactly the same bottles at a wellknown online store including shipping costs for euros can get thats simply cheating well done dfds small update we are now a week further and now the two bottles are also on sale at the wellknown internet store now for euros so dfds simply charges more under the guise of an offer in a taxfree shop scandalous latest update dfds came up with the argument that they base the sales prices on the manufacturers recommended retail price with these sales practices you can forget about attractive offers in the dfds dutyfree shop so be careful
journey was flow less i had a breakdown while on my way to the ferry i called and the staff was nice enough to change my departure time
first time travelling by ferry compared to flying in recent times much more relaxed food was excellent staff friendly and lots for kids i booked the cheapest cabin and unfortunately did not sleep well cushion gives no support so i would suggest bring your own it can be quite noisy so i would bring ear plugs too facilities were good otherwise and will try the sea view cabin hopefully at some point
i like dfds a lot never had any issues either with booking boarding or even at passport control only stars as the of the toilets were not working and a couple of soap dispensers were empty and on a busy crossing it was a little difficult to find one that worked or wasnt in use other than that i will always use dfds for my crossings
busy vessel with the departure time brought forward to cater for inclement weather embarkation handled with aplomb
ferry on time loading efficient i would like better food and pet cabin
pleasant ship and crossing fairly punctual i cannot comment on the bars or restaurants as i never use those facilities a large range of dutyfree wines sprits and perfumes are on sale in the onboard shop but the selection of beers available is abysmal lowquality lagers only if you want english beer buy at the dfds shop in calais before boarding
the ferries run on time they are clean and well maintained the staff are professional and pleasant it is the third time this year that i cross between newhaven and dieppe and its a consistently positive experience
i understood that due to possible bad weather our sailing from dieppe was brought forward by half an hour i was texted to let me know and when we arived at the port we recived the usual warm welcome and curtious staff of dfds the on board food is always of good quality with a good selection of drinks too a perfect way to travel to and from france
i usually dont have a problem with dfds i contacted them asking when the sailings would be available they replied they didnt know but to keep trying the website on looking again it appears bookings can only be made weeks in advance the first week of january has now appeared on the calendar why wasnt this explained at the time
excellent discount for my age when i remembered to phone call my return booking which was half the price of crossing france to uk several weeks earlier i was told no cabins and had just bedded down on the floor as usual as i cannot sit sleep easily in the reclining chairs when the speaker notification said there were cabins available i did not get up in a rush but did get to hours sleep before arriving in france soon after dieppe i had to stop and sleep in my van for another hours sleep i have always been happy with the newhaven dieppe and return journey thank you to all the staff who make it easy for the drivers to board and unboard
too many schedule changes by dfds lead to confusion about our correct departure time at calais which was unhelpful after a long drive from spain added to that total inflexibility on the part of your checkin operative meant that we just missed a sailing and had a long wait for the next ferry on top of all that the food offering onboard is extremely poor quality we will be using p and o on future trips
we just left and we loved every minute from the first employee we met to the last we felt a sense of belonging of being welcome on board what the trip gives me personally the mother of the family is relaxation and relaxation theres nothing i have to do after all read and play cards and switch completely and completely off the rocking quotwalkquot of the boat does something for body and soul it should actually be possible to obtain as a grant from the doctor for stress hit where you measured the stress hormone in the blood on boarding and when you are back on land it would definitely work for some people good for the economy just saying thank you from the bottom of my heart my week is off to a good start with dfds seaway we meet again soon
ferry sailed and arrived exactly on time the cafe restaurant bar and shop would provide everything any traveler would need staff were helpful and pleasant whats not to like
we were booked on the sailing but we arrived about minutes before the the loading operative managed to load us on that one even though it was in with the trucks we were more than happy
very good sailing both ways everything went smoothly and staff polite and attentive we changed our return sailing which was easy to do and not unreasonably expensive
booked a return ferry crossing from newhaven to dieppe to visit friends in normandy the whole booking experience as well as the check in boarding went smoothly would highly recommend this route to anybody wishing to drive to france thank you
very good we were lucky to have a smooth easy crossing both ways to and from amsterdam the staff particularly the kitchen staff work their socks off they are very kind and courteous and the food was delicious both for dinner and breakfast and good value for money the cabins were clean and spacious enough both the bunk bed ones on the way there and the seaview one on the way back very happy with the trip thanks
having bought a flexible return i expected that i might be able to contact dfds to rearrange the time and date of the return crossing no such luck i sent countless emails and made many phone calls to no avail the phone was never answered and one email they sent me in response said that they had booked me on a crossing the date of the crossing was the day before the date of their email on my last full day in the uk i had many things i wanted to do in practice i did little more than bombard dfds with emails and phone calls asking to book a return the next day eventually i had no option other than to book my return with irish ferries and cancel my dfds return ticket within minutes of doing this dfds confirmed that i was booked to be on the crossing i had been trying to book with them for days since all this happened i have been trying to get them to refund the money i paid for my flexible return which allows for a refund on cancallation two weeks later i am still dealing with this i strongly advise travellers not to use dfds at any price i have read the automatic message dfds put on this site after a poor review rest assured that i have given them ample chance to make amends they fail at every hurdle
excellent crossing on the ferry will travel again
absolutely brilliant experience fast checkin offered an earlier ferry great breakfast much better than le shuttle and brittany ferries
despite the ferry being half empty we were squeezed in so tight that my passenger could only exit the car door with difficultly and i had to help the driver of the car alongside out of their door other than that the crossing was good
i travel with dfds a lot winter and summer but after this last experience i am seriously considering trying the caenportsmouth route last night i travelled dieppenewhaven customs at dieppe were charming but on the boat i was put right up up the top caged as i all it i was travelling alonewoman aged in my mini the third person in the queue to get on having made the effort to get there hours before as suggested it took hours to unload us poor people at the top my advice arrive late at customs in dieppe then you cannot be put up the top
unfortunately we were not allowed to disembark for minutes on our inbound journey on tuesday th october very disappointing and extremely inconvenient especially at that time of night
troublefree journey i have used this crossing newhavendieppe numerous times and always found it wellmanaged and easy to use the ferries are clean with adequate food and drink available highly recommend a cabin for a restful journey worth the cost
really seamless trip arrived early and got bumped to earlier ferry at no charge which was great i paid about for the premium lounge which was great i was the only one there comfy chairs and sofas lovely clean toilets free welcome glass of prosecco and as much tea coffee biscuits cake crisps fizz or water as you want
ferry departed on time and boarding was well organised and timely the boat was clean food was fine and duty free well stocked crossing either way was calm and stress free although a little queuing mins there were no issues delays or problems entering or leaving french customs roads to and from dover ferry port from am were not busy and traffic moved at good regular speed
always a pleasure to travel with dfds staff onboard are to a high standard the cabins are clean and the food is reasonably priced we use them every time we travel to the continent
i arrived very late for the gate due to horrific traffic but all of the staff were accommodating and helpful i was allowed to board and continued my journey as planned
we had a mini cruise to amsterdam getting on the boat was good getting off the boat took over an hour and ate into our time in amsterdam getting onto the busses could have been more organised cabins were clean and functional only issue for us was we felt like we were directly over the engine our cabin was so loud others in our group didnt have the same problem so was specific to us recommend if you are a light sleeper pay a bit extra for the quiet rooms i didnt know that was an option great value for money for us
everything went as planned which in our experience of life these days is unusual we went for a cabin this time which was definitely worth it probably didnt need to pay extra for a sea view though as it was the overnight ferry
lovely crossing and such a good price we will carry on using this route but please turn the heat up on the early morning crossing it was freezing
the service was as good as usualbut was disappointed with the minimum choice of one brand of champagne on board so did not buy anybefore sailing had thought of going to your tax free shop at calais but it was a long walk from the back of lane where we were parked i couldnt manage getting the bottles back
travelled up through france on the friday and arrived at calais early saturday morning booked for but was offered a place on the result smooth trip great shopping nice restaurant to while away the minute trip back to uk thank you dfds
both services we booked delayed by over minutes with no information ahead of time waited hours at calais terminal with no lounge building seats or restaurant available just vending machines then offered a drinks voucher as compensation terrible
very efficient and courteous staff clean ship and it ran on time we were allowed to travel on an earlier ship on the return journey
i booked a ferry it got cancelled due to the lockdown and to redeem the credit note has been a joke i have days notice that the credit note will be unusable i cant book anything pass december also refusing to pay the money back disgrace
having had an accident in the uk which put me in a wheelchair for my journey home to france we were concerned as to how we would manage it but with the help and assistance given by the staff of the ferry the entire journey was trouble free and we have nothing but praise for the ferry operators and its staff thank you
easy to book online and had no problems boarding the ferry would book again
all went well until we reached the large open area to join the correct lane designated by the overhead signs there was no clear sign for dfds cars caravans or motor homes the one sign that was eventually deemed to be for dfds was not fully illuminated vehicles were having to back up from other lanes it was total confusion there were odd vehicles in the open area trying to find their way accidents waiting to happen all the overhead stations showed a red cross there was no green cross showing for dfds this is the third time we have experienced this twice we have had to leave calais port completely there is no exit sign either however the ship and the crossing was good
enjoyed the crossing and restaurant pleasant staff disembarkation at dieppe very slow all passports in same lanes and only staff on duty hours to get off a lot better disembarkation at newhaven minutes
its the first time im travelling with dfds and i dont think ill do it again i was a foot passenger with a pet friendly cabin the cabin was very very basic and smelly and i paid for it very not welcoming not a bottle of water or a bowl for my dog or like some poo bag or a mat absolutely noting i usually use a different ferry company for the crossing and i can definitely see the difference even for the same price or usually less another problem i had was the food there was no place to buy some food to bring in cabin with me the choice was booking the table in one of the restaurants or dont eat for the entire time i picked the second because i didnt want to leave my dog on his own due to the sea condition he was scared not even a sandwich or a slice of pizza nothing the only positive thing about dfds is the check in very easy and quick other than that i wouldnt recommend or use again you should value all your consumers even the one with a pet especially when you charge a fortune for a foot passenger crossing
fast checkin flexibility to be put onto earlier ferry was fantastic new ship friendly staff huge improvement on the old ferries
we always use dfds to cross to france the food onboard is good and inexpensive
need more direction guidelines for the bike cyclist to the ferry terminal in calais dover side is very clear apart from that everything is fine
clean ship friendly staff and attentive very good crossing
as usual a really good experience friendly staff amazing bistro food and very adequate cabin only negative comment was the time taken in ijmuiden to get through passport control almost an hour and half but appreciate this is not in the hands of dfds
excellent experience easy straightforward and fast calais to dover hour and a half done took the dog and they even gave him treats so allround great experience
excellent value for money our recent crossing was number boats very reliable just one late departure due to gales good choice of sailing times and operations at newhaven dieppe efficient could do with better wifi and new seats however
timings perfect on board facilities good only thing was the time taken at passport control and bus transfer into amsterdam left very little time to look around the city
ferry was on time and clean boarding is straightforward sufficient marshals to ensure we didnt drive into the sea staff on board all greeted us with cheery faces and the offer of breakfast all as good as it should be
very happy with our experience using dfds ferries punctual clean good food and friendly staff
surprise trip to fruen ended okay but with many disappointments along the way always a bit disappointed by the state of the cabins that no more care is taken of them in general and the lack of plugs in the room when yes thats how it is we then find out that part of the ship is blocked off for a private event perhaps it should be informed that of where people hang out sent in the evening is closed incl the outdoor bar at the back so you practically had no access to the top deck mermaid salon i think it was called explores club as it was only evening entertainment on board for adults the ceiling vibrated so much and the bass boomed from the enclosed disco that it was difficult to hear what was being said on stage and the music was later regularly drowned out by the bass from the floor above where were the adults who stepped up and told them to turn it down the morning then there is no information about the speakers and there are many of us on board who are surprised that we are so far from oslo by chance i hear some staff mention that we are delayed because the ship had sailed back with an overdose to frederikshavn of course you have no power over that and also sure they have sailed faster to catch up but wouldnt it be a responsible shipping company to announce that to people over the loudspeakers so it didnt become the word of mouth method seemed a bit like you hoped people wouldnt discover it saw us who had gone to oslo on sunday for sightseeing had the trip cancelled as our time ashore was reduced from to hours the trips were cancelled and effort had been made to offer a shorter trip or postpone the departure by hour the other way and catch up again so you got what you ordered a hour time slot in oslo the alternative was we could go around oslo ourselves but everything was closed so a guided tour was ideal for a sunday trip back on the ship we chose to upgrade the cabin so we got a little more luxury on board and it was a shame it was also real luxury not quite worth the money the vip of the trip was clearly our waiter and the food at explorer she alone deserves stars so because of her and the food there goes from to stars top class service and humor a lot
on the trip to oslo we were two couples and two singles we had booked two double exterior cabins and two interior cabins the booking on both out and the return journey four days later succeeded in exchanging both cabins and partners with each other if there is to be any meaning in naming the boarding passes this problem should probably be worked on
used dfds for the past sailings since june excellent service via chat line for bookings very accommodating when arrive at port early to put you on next available ferry staff onboard always polite and helpful
travelled many times with dfds and almost always found it a pleasant experience my last voyage was late on a monday night not a busy ferry yet i was happy to fine the quiet lounges on the upper deck both open my only observation would be that it would perhaps be nice to have a notice asking occupants not to make noise or watch screen material without the use of headphones there was one other occupant and his video viewing made sleeping impossible otherwise a really nice crossing
we enjoyed travelling in both directions on the doverdunkirke route we managed to get earlier ferries which improved our overall great experience we look forward to our next trip with you
the loading and unloading of cars takes too long it took minutes after docking in newhaven to get off the boat then a long queue to go through the border force otherwise the trip was ok newhaven dieppe route is very convenient living in sussex and wanting to get to western france and brittany saves over miles driving by avoiding dovereuro tunnel
i made a mistake which was completely my fault having made a booking for wednesday at i arrived at the port on wednesday evening and in fact for some reason realised when i was about ten mins away that i should have been there hours earlier i arrived at the port fairly sheepish to my surprise they couldnt have been more understanding and just transferred me to the crossing at midnight there was no fuss and they just laughed along with me what a brilliant service
generally good but more crowded and more expensive than our regular crossings inches past
the crossing was on time and staff were very helpful with my dogs
we have been on a minicruise from copenhagen to oslo a number of times and always loved it and had some fantastic experiences this time however it was quite a bit different we booked a long time ago and chose to order quotad exterior standard cabinsquot as we have smaller children who need to sleep with us when we get on board we are given rooms on opposite sides of the boat quite far from each other we expected when it was booked at the same time that we would get cabins relatively close to each other so that we adults could sit together in a cabin with a baby monitor for the children the cabins were tiny if there is a m floor then that is probably also kindly described one room had a tv the other didnt which could be nice now that we adults couldnt sit together anyway weve also never experienced any mattresses or pillows that were so miserable the mattresses were so thin or worn that you could clearly feel all the springs the pillows were also ultrathin and completely useless it occurred to us that there was a stop in frederikshavn this has not happened before and it is super appropriate on many levels firstly departure is already at pm which means you have much less time for us in oslo than before this also means that you will be woken up at on the trip to oslo and at on the trip to copenhagen as it is not particularly quiet when docking at the same time announcements are sent through all loudspeakers to the new passengers it is a huge degradation to have to stop in frederikshavn we had ordered the breakfast buffet on the trip to oslo we were there at a little past and waited in a very very long queue it was not open in seas they had chosen to move the buffet upstairs the queue basically didnt move during the half hour we were there after this it was announced that everyone should go downstairs to seas as they now opened there it became the wild west as everyone stormed downstairs it would probably have been optimal to open there first as there were really many passengers on the boat the staff in the restaurant were very nice and helpful the buffet was ok however it could have been a bit more exciting if it wasnt identical both days all in all it was actually a huge disappointment to go on a mini cruise this time and we hope you will take some of these things with you in any case we will very strongly consider whether we even have to go a second time
update their response of please contact us is just so people here think they will do something about the complaint i did contact them and have never heard from them again we did a trip newcastleijmuidennewcastle and our experience was not great i am disabled and when boarding the king seaway in newcastle i explained that i needed direct access from the car deck to the pet friendly cabins as i was travelling with my assistance dog and although i can walk short distances stairs are very difficult for me i told them that at the very least i needed access to the lift we were boarded to a deck that had neither and resulted in a very long walk with many flights of stairs to get to my cabin i was in pain and exhausted by the time i got to my cabin the only positive was that after stopping by reception to explain that my very tiny medical assistance dog would be with me in public areas and showing her credentials and id they sent a message to all departments to inform them and we were welcomed all over the ship with no bother the return journey on the princess seaways was very different this time we were boarded correctly with direct access to the pet friendly cabins but the rest of the experience was terrible the dog toilet areas on this ship had no fake grass to encourage the dogs to use the area they had a small sand box do they think dogs are the same as cats i mean seriously why again i dropped by reception to explain about my assistance dog and show her credentials the man was quite dismissive but said it was all fine i was stopped and questioned by crew at every single turn i was asked numerous times why i need the dog what does the dog do and it doesnt look like a guide dog all of which invaded my privacy embarrassed me in front of other passengers and made my anxiety shoot sky high i was questioned over times it was truly an awful experience we paid a lot of money for this trip our first since the start of the pandemic many staff just shouted and barked at me that the dog was not allowed to be there without making any attempt to find out why i had her with me dfds needs to give immediate equality and diversity training to its crews i am now very fearful of travelling again and dfds crew have destroyed my confidence to be able to travel with my assistance dog and my disability a foot note that they need to do something about the temperature in the cabins even with the cooling at maximum the cabin temperature was unbearably hot one positive our wc in the cabin was not functioning and it was repaired promptly and without too much fuss
newhaven to dieppe felt a bit like second class citizens we were made to wait until the cars had boarded until we were brought on by bus and in france leaving the boat last had to wait some time for the luggage to appear on the way back although we were last to be let on we were let off first and luggage arrived very quickly which up for it a bit some very friendly staff and customs people too
a really bad service my girlfriend buys something on a website back in january and in doing so she received an email from the company that we can get a free trip with dfds from copenhagen for people if we choose a weekday i decided to go with friends as my girlfriend is not very strong my friends and i agree to book a trip here in september and pay for it to be a weekend i pay and get rid of dkk as we get some discount due to the above as we approach the day of travel we find out that out of cant come anyway and unfortunately we couldnt find anyone else who could come along so i choose to call dfds customer service to move the date to a weekend in november it is not possible to move the date so i have to order new tickets i found out that the discount i got the first time cannot be made again and there will be a fee for the cancellation i ask the customer service representative to cancel my order i then see on my account that i have received dkk and dfds has taken dkk in cancellation fees we are all very disappointed with this experience and want never to book a new trip with dfds
very smooth process and sailing would sail again with dfds
tried to book a ticket from paldiski ee to kapellskar se as foot passenger which is not possible on the website customer service wrote you can travel on this route as a foot passenger however you will need to book a pet friendly cabin for the duration please contact us on or email after three days back and forth on emails and calls someone now tells me that it is not possible please consider the implications it has for people when you misinform and drag on so customers are left without any alternatives already have a ticket for a nonrefundable train from kapellskar as i trusted your information
good only thing was the return at the port were the search was completely over the top
excellent throughout from booking to our journey couldnt fault any aspect well done to all the staff
we had a trouble free relaxed return crossing dover calais
first time with dfds everything great staff food shop and efficient no hassle clean ship oh and polite helpful staff shoreside as well as on board thank you
a very good journey we were able to travel on an earlier vessel without any problem or additional cost i love the flexibility of plus or minus hour spread of the booked journey facilities on board were very good
outstanding ferry company we got a flat tyre in france and dfds let us on so that we could get ourselves fixed up in dover without them we would have been stranded and cost a fortune in recovery will always now use dfds and we travel weekly outstanding service
on both legs of the journey we had to wait in the car in stifeling heat for around minutes on the car deckwe have used dfds on many occasions and have never had to wait this long
unable to access my booking online to amend whilst i was in france and had to pay full price at the ferry terminal
went with the oslo ferry from copenhagen to oslo on july had ordered the commodore cabin to be good to myself unfortunately the conference corridor which is just above these cabins has been converted into a play area just above my cabin was a bouncy castle there would be rather large and sudden bumps where i felt as if the ceiling was falling on my head complained en route but was told the boat was full also wrote a complaint to get compensation the complaint was rejected on the grounds that noise is to be expected on a boat i am well aware of this as i have often sailed the boat but never experienced noise of that caliber with constant bumps over your head i dont call that noise but noise buying an expensive cabin where i could sit in peace was a waste of money poor customer care on the part of dfds that they do not take the complaint seriously with some compensation
very mediocre experience with the dunkirkdoverdunkirk ferry especially when compared to the efficiency of the eurotunnel on our trip to the uk the ferry had a technical and we had to take the next ferry which was then more than hour delayed leading to a total delay of hrs unfortunately there was no prealert or transparency despite dfds having all our details we just found out by chance the duty free shop in dunkirk is poorly stocked and there is no cafe or other possibility to spend time on our trip back from dover the process was very efficient but dfds had decided to just close off the lounge area on deck when i asked why they just shrugged and said that there were enough other seats available hmm thats an interesting service mindset sorry dfds not what i had hoped for back to the train again a bit more expensive but much faster and a much better experience
the crown ferry was due to depart at pm but received an sms the same day that it was at pm we therefore only had hours in oslo as the ferry didnt arrive until am and we had to check in no later than pm on the return trip there were of us in a bed cabin we couldnt imagine having been in the small room it had been extremely close the shower was good we slept well the pizza restaurant made good quality but overpriced the breakfast buffet was also nice but we missed that much more space to eat food we had brought because there was no room in the room we also missed cheaper and healthy options to get something to eat on board including a few gluten free options for example fresh smoothies juices sandwiches and salads or wok dishes for dkk max the duty free shop only has unhealthy things like chocolate and crisps water costs dutyfree and electricity mer everywhere else on the ferry and missed some general foodmini market if you want to avoid spending a lot of money you must remember a very large cooler with food for the trip food in norway also costs a fortune would count on a dinner buffet on the return trip but it will quickly become an expensive trip can recommend hnselovisas house in oslo by the waterfall
very efficient check in even though we only had our booking reference number plus the checkin completed advance passenger info for my friend who had forgot to do it staff on board were great i have a motorcycle and can never work out how to strap it down crew came to my assistance without asking only complaint was there were too many children on board for my liking
my wife and i have made many crossings with you over the last few years between newhaven and dieppe always a good experience two days ago we travelled to newhaven on the seven sisters the crossing was completely booked out but your crew and especially the catering team dealt superbly with the crowds polite efficient and helpful as always our congratulations to them and to your organising skills thank you peter and karen bunting
good service and still a full flexibility to be booked on a previous ship if we arrive early
dfds are without a doubt the easiest and most flexible cross channel ferry company i find them prompt friendly and accommodating even when extremely busy they are a joy to travel with as an example i recently arrived to the terminal very early the check in person managed to get me on an earlier ferry minutes before it departed brilliant
we travelled on aug from dover to calais queued for about minutes to get through french customs and as we had arrived in good time were offered an earlier crossing all exactly as you would expect
excellent service got on the earlier ferries both inward and outward journeys
very good service and very helpful had a reservation for and was much earlier at the terminal and was offered an earlyer ferry very satisfied about the service
not travelled newhaven dieppe in a while dfds service was very good
we wanted to move our booking to dunkirk due to less queue time at passport control thanks to twitter updates and a quick response from the customer service team it was done in no time really good customer service i would rate that for sure a couple of negative points are around the duty free area cleanliness was really lacking and when leaving it felt like a public toilet the toilets on the ferry were also very messy still a good experience and as regular travellers well continue to use dfds so much better than po on all levels
a smooth crossing to dunkirk in all senses of the word the catering was better than i expected loading was straightforward and completed quickly on and off the return crossing was equally smooth although conditions onboard were much noisier and rather overcrowded that of course was more to do with the passengers than dfds my only complaint is that there was nowhere at dunkirk ferry port to get a snack or even a drink surely others must want something during an almost two hour wait
the lane staff at calais were really friendly
check inboarding and exit all exemplary journey comfortable and fooddrink on board of a good standard albeit a bit overpriced but then to be expected only issue i had was with sizelayout of duty free shop for number of customers on board made shopping here a real chore thanks to all staff for two otherwise great crossings
well fitted out new ship great customer service from all staff
excellent organisation smooth trip very impressed had not used ferries for years always used tunnel will use dfds again no question
efficient polite and informative shoreside and on board prices are competitive and as a regular cross channel customer the sailing times suit my requirements with the option of sailing either side of booked time being a useful safely net from the time of booking until the point of return emails from dfds updating you of offers booking confirmation and possible changes are clear and helpful especially helpful during the covid crisis
parking staff extremely rude the guy that just parked us on the dunkirk to dover ferry from dock needs to seriously calm down whilst parking us on a bend between decks which im sure he has to do because of lack of space he was shouting at me like a lunatic and forced me to park all the way up the car of another passenger who was subsequently unable to open his car door to step out when we reversed to give him some wiggle room he resumed the inarticulate shouting and dismissed our reasons for moving not exactly the first thing you want to hear when youve driven through the night and are exhausted and looking forward to some comfortable travelling
no concerns with this crossing swift embarkation lounge area a little cool for sleeping delays with french customs only
ferry was good but premium lounge would be more relaxing if children u werent allowed the facilities on dockside need improvement especially calais where people need a decent space for refreshments
a service with flexibility which i need if arrived at ferry early or late they will put in next available crossing no fuss
a ticket modified without our notice from am to am result a missed train at dover no possibility of contacting dfds in french i am very disappointed with this company this is my first time traveling with her and i dont understand their lack of professionalism at all the only person on board who showed us a little sympathy unfortunately could not do anything but had a commercial gesture for a meal on board this unfortunately does not reimburse our missed train ticket i have the impression that the dfds company only favors truck drivers but that family customers ultimately have no place on their boat
petrol station put wrong fuel in my car car broke down days late i come to ferry and i have to pay ticket again if it was po they would change my ticket so no more travelling with your company
pleasant crossing ease of loading with a motorbike pushed up to the earlier boat on return only negative is the lack of available working toilets on each deck
to be honest the ship felt old and in need of a upgrade for the number of passengers setting was not good but on the good side the staff were very good would i use newhaven to dieppe again well that depends on the price difference between brittany ferrys and dfds
really great staff were friendly only issue was time to get out of the port on both france and the uk sides i dont think this was down to dfds though
really good customer service allowed me to change my booking on day to get an earlier ferry really helped all comms ahead of the travel dates were spot on
flawless experience return dover to calais efficient and friendly crew on and off flexibility in the ticket no hassle beautiful crossings
i stopped using the ferries for some time and used eurotunnel i got fed up with the constant delays with eurotunnel etc and decided to go back to the ferries dfds to be precise i forgot how relaxing it was the staff are extremely helpfull i had time to gather my thoughts of the journey ahead great experience
everything was great except the server behind the cafe counter we asked for tap water during the heat wave as we had a continuing journey as everyone does on a car ferry and the woman was rude rolled her eyes and said you have to be kidding me considering water is a basic thing passengers are entitled to this was an unnecessary response to a simple request
at dunquerke the dfds staff was very rude the lady that check my car was extremely rude she wouldnt talk to me and while she demanded to open the boot was talking in french with his colleagues without paying any attention or respect to the car and his content she didnt even tell me the she finished as she just put her back at me worst treatment ever is this the way to treat a customer
which cabin you end up in on the ferry is a lottery you pay a large amount and then wait and see whether you will have a quiet night or whether you can sleep next to the motorcycles and that was our last experience deafening noise not a wink of sleep it was uncomfortably warm in the hut it felt like we couldnt get any air a very unpleasant experience
seamless and easy check in and boarding clean boats and friendly staff a very good experience
great service got us on to an earlier ferry when we arrived early great food and drink on the ferry and a great start to our holiday
travelled with my car from newcastle to amsterdam just over a month ago cabin and meals on board very good however major concerns boarding and disembarking on car deck when we boarded we were told to park so close to the side bulkhead that my wife could not open the passenger door and had to exit by the driver door a painful experience for her as she has just had a replacement hip operation the worst was still to come we made our way to our cars to disembark and had to wait an hour and twenty minutes until moving off the ferry those of you who have had to wait in a car deck inside a car will know how warm it becomes despite opening windows as you cannot run your air conditioning what made the situation worse was that we were given no indication whatsoever on the pa system as to the cause of the delay and how long we would have to wait the result was that we were late in continuing our onward journey and only got to our hotel in france very late that same evening i subsequently reported all this to dfds on their feedback form and was promised a followup telephone call to discuss the matter i am still waiting for it not good enough dfds i am sure you can do much better
i was at calais port at and still missed the ferry because the passport control was so slow the line was not long there were not many cars just one line was really slow and no one did anything about it they just told people to get back in their cars i could get the next ferry h later and no refund or drink or anything i tried to explain and they told me this happens every day and multiple cars always miss the boat even if they are in time so i dont recommend this
use a different company i am writing this email to let you know about the service you offer in your premium lounges my booking details were direct ferries reference dfp ferry operator reference i booked lounge access for my partner because she needed a quiet place to rest due to the distance she had to drive however she was greeted by a family with kids treating your lounge like an amusement park this is not conducive to any lounge ishe has ever used she approached your staff members to address this issue and they treated it with apathy and content i am utterly disgusted by how your team handled this issue and how the other family spoke to her when she approached them she gently reminded them that this was a lounge and they should act in an according manner which is mindful of others i paid for a service and did not receive what i paid for and i would kindly request that you refund the money for the lounge it was more like a zoo than a lounge furthermore i have tried contacting customer services but none of the emails work on their website use a different company
after years of the chunnel and finding the communication and delays frustrating we decided to give the ferry a go standard info that we needed to allow mins at dover and calais was incorrect so we had hours sat dockside at dover then uk border control at calais was super slow and it was not particularly busy crossing itself was good but why only working ladies toilets out and back after queuing through passports the last thing you need with kids is queueing again for ages for the loo so whilst the crossing was pleasant we were in the premium lounge which was lovely we will go on the chunnel again next time the extra hour travelling time and slightly longer journey wasnt worth it for us
every year we do a mini cruise from ijmuiden to newcastle at different times prechristmas carnival this year in september and we are always impressed the ships are a bit older but very well looked after the staff are super friendly the ships have a feelgood atmosphere that is what makes them so appealing to us everyone goes on a cruise in a white suit with a stupid captains dinner these days ps since last year everyone has had enough time to find out about the passport requirement when entering great britain anyone who doesnt do this is an idiot and shouldnt blame dfds
hour wait for british customs which meant we missed our ferry app useless with no updates very few refreshments on board
good and reliable service as ever have been happily using dfds for many years on the dover to dunkirk route
very good the real problem is the waiting time at customs
another pleasant trip particularly stress free in a summer of turmoil at the channel ports this service is so valuable to us in the north east newcastle munich newcastle for the european championships staff are great processes efficient and cabin a good environment had a meal in the posh restaurant on the way over and the food was exceptionally good did self service on the way back and the quality was very good want a downside one ship is differently laid out than the other if im not mistaken the simple quiet bar on one is preferable to the noisier cabaret style of the other i suspect that passengers these days prefer a more sophisticated quieter experience that the old fashioned cabaret entertainment might be just me anyway thanks for a great trip the north would be greatly disadvantaged if this service ended if we were travelling to france id still rather go with dfds just to avoid uk roads and the channel port chaos perhaps you should advertise the benefits across the country
we had a credit note on file due to covid and this was not attached to the invoice so we were charged again days before trip one simple phone call and it was sorted as an apology we were given access to premier lounge excellent especially the hostess on the delayed noon ferry from dunkerque on mon th aug she was great check in facilities and general welcome by all staff was excellent we always travel dfds since we first did that says something
dfds is by far the best ferry service dover calais comfortable ships efficient loadingunloading i e used them times this year well done
hi i booked a reservation with you but unfortunately we had an accident on road and i cancelled the booking how long time its take to get a refund thank you
very friendly and uncomplicated check in as weve been very early in the harbor they offered to book us on an earlier ferry what a pleasure and we quickly went on
we travelled to dunkirk and back to visit family in germany the outward journey was st class we got to the port early and the member of staff booking us in was very helpful and put us on an earlier sailing we had booked the premium lounge the staff member again was very good offering assistance when we needed it the journey back was totally different we had booked the lounge again the member of staff again initially was very helpful however she then had an argument with another member of staff this could be heard throughout the lounge this was followed things being banged down and slammed we had had a long journey and wanted to relax this was anything but next time i am considering booking the relax lounge as this was not what we paid for
queues for uk passport control were hours long while this is not your fault you could provide staff to give information about ferry availability and delays and to control the attempted queue jumping and support th stress levels of passengers
dfds is my lovely ferry company operator i use this company many years and always was satisfied with everything delicious meal snacks drinks i always hungry on the boat
our familys first experience to drive around europe and dfds did not disappoint wifi aboard the ship whilst on transit can improve though but its not a big matter as we have good connections via our phone data we will use the service again on our next european road trip
bought a fixed ticket for recent motorbike holiday going out was fine but had to come back early as i had a medical emergency i got to nice and couldnt find my heart medication got to calais and they said they had no choice but to charge me a new full price pounds ticket to get home dfds did have a choice empathy consideration and compassion seems to be missing from their corporate policy so if you buy a fixed ticket understand dfds policy is you pays your money you takes your chance yes im disgusted i wasnt well enough to argue my case at the terminal so i just paid up happy customer no
dfds seaways and seaweeds contrary to our legitimate expectations dfds seaways is far from levelling danish quality standards frequently crossing the channel we had decided to boycott po whose services we had been using for years by ethics and because of the treatment reserved to their workers dfds was an option bad choice part one the outward crossing went at least on schedule first flaw however the catering service is reduced to a strict minimum no restaurant just a school canteen offering more than limited choices we stuck to an eatable fish chips second flaw on a beautiful summer day we hoped to be able to benefit from the two large open areas at the back of the ferry disillusion no table no chair no bench the passengers were bound to stand up or to sit on the rusty sheet metal this yearold dclass shows signs of corrosion everywhere the paint is peeling off in blue patches in the open areas part two on the way back we arrived in dover in advance departure scheduled for h crossing the attendant offered us the destination dunkirk departure hours crossing which we accepted first flaw the attendant forgot our priority boarding which had been paid for second flaw at the ferry had still not left the dock and passengers were roasting in the sun the bloody experience was just to begin third flaw shortly after passing calais the ferry released off large billows of black smoke and almost came to a standstill it was already the ferry paddled at pedestrian pace to its dock accumulating delays to arrive in dunkirk around already an hour late oddly a passenger announcement attributed the delay to manoeuvres from a previous ferry awful lie all passengers present from calais on the open areas witnessed the total absence of activity at the dunkirk terminal yet clearly visible from the ferry additional flaws we had to wait more than a quarter of an hour to obtain access to the vehicles gates remaining locked without any explanation once the access was authorised the passengers were left literally abandoned in their vehicles for more than another half hour while the boat was half empty at the start we finally left that dfds ferry more than one hour and a half behind schedule and probably well after the arrival of the dovercalais connection that we were supposed to take down curtains the dfds service is pitiful on the way back the canteen even served uneatable dried fish cold chips probably unconsumed residues from the first crossing and that ferry was not reliable due to technical failures which the french company is trying to hide with false excuses in any case po really has nothing to worry about and for what is dfds seaways it is seaweeds never again
boarding and ground staff was spot on especially for cyclists first in first out lol cant say the same about the french side some of the port staff can be rude may be brexit lol had to wait an hour to be escorted to the port exit
a wonderful experience sailing with dfds on the minicruise to oslo which i recommend to anyone who wants a family trip at an affordable price good facilities on board for both adults and children delicious food and good entertainment clean and tidy everywhere the crew is extremely serviceminded friendly and welcoming everywhere on the ship but special mention must be made of nakita who is on duty at pearl seaways who made the sailing trip an even greater experience
good service to dunkirk overall one hour delay on return because of cancelled sailing no explanation why
ferry was delayed no one replied my complaint
your service and value for money were excellent you were let down slightly by the loading and unloading times for your vessels thanks steve
your reservation number on august my friend and i decide to spend one day in england departure on at am and return on at pm not departing from calais as usual with pampo but from dunkirk with the company dfds so i bought passengerbike tickets for on the th i was found positive for covid and informed dfds by telephone that i would not be able to go in gb on and requests a refund of my tickets my contact informs me that this is not possible but that she extends the validity of my purchase until which satisfies me on the th i receive an email from dfds which informs me that my modification has been made cost for a departure on and a return on ie more than months after my departure wella day trip and it cost me due to covid cost of the crossing cost of the stupid modification total for a crossing the chanel which i did not do for a try with dfdsit wasnt a masterstroke someone will say to me quotbut why didnt you call them back to explainquot my answer quotso that this costs me quot i will go and spend my day in dover with pampo from calais as usual when i am cured of covid in week marc
first time taking the car abroad couldnt have been easier ferry on time also booked a cabin which was spotless
this is our first time with dfds and we have not had any issue we have had a smooth journey
ferry crossing was on time for both departure and return journeys very comfortable crossing took the cabin on return journey as it was the midnight crossing and all my family slept well
the ship departed and arrived pretty much on time she was pretty clean and seating was comfortable staff were friendly and helpful price was reasonable given height of season only negatives were slow loading and very slow boarder control on arrival to uk but i assume these not under dfdss control will use service again
had good trip with dfds easy check in however the air conditioning was far too cold and draughty spoilt our crossing a little have never had this problem before
very long delays after we boarded and again very long waiting time to off board over hours delay really not happy
very happy with the servjce and professionalism of tbe staff got to dover early and i was offered an early departure which suited me best
the crossing experience was good both ways staff are helpful and friendly the facilities are varied enough to keep us occupied the food very acceptable given the challenges of catering for such high numbers our only frustration is of the boarding and disembarking experiences both of which took a long time and could be better organised eg by noting who has waited longer and how cars and lorries are integrated on the decks
there was a lot of waiting around during embarkation and disembarkation for foot passengers
the outward journey was good and staff helpful and excellent croissants newish boat all on time return crossing tried to get earlier boat hit it was cancelled and this was only put on the twitter feed mins beforehand better communication from french port needed as they were aware at least an hour before to help plan the display also stated boarding was taking place creating confusion for all the original crossing was then late also so not the best experience food choices limited also
good price especially if book early the hours ticket is very useful particularly when travelling a long way to the ports on both legs we arrived early and got onto an earlier ferry no probs ferry well equipped lots of space great to get out onto the deck and take in some sea air
friendly staff difficult instructions on the outward journey but the instructions on the return journey were perfect criticism we had to pay an additional euros too high a price for our dog in klaipeda to be able to take him into the cabin even though the dog had been registered in the online booking there was no indication of any special cleaning of the cabin
it was all good so far my review would probably be stars but at in the morning we would be among the first to disembark it is degrees outside and it is am and we are still standing in front of customs and we have to move all our rows to one lane super bad this really isnt possible
unbelievable i had booked a crossing from dunkirk to dover and back but i had to cancel it about weeks before departure as i took the economy fare i am not entitled to a refund as a passenger because the quotcancellation feequot is of the total price i would have had over a week to sell my seat to someone else but instead they pocketed my money as well as the money of the person who is essentially taking my seat
on the outward journey in line with current advice we arrived early we passed through border controls and joined the queue at the dfds check in only to be told we were too early less than hours and could either leave the port and return to what or go to dunkirk i opted for the latter with the late departure longer crossing and extra mins drive i was more than an hour late
easy to book quick to board and get off the other side arrived early and put on an early ferry so saved time on our whole journey
we arrived earlier in port exactly hours and they embark us straight away didnt have to wait thanks
i was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic service it was perfectly organised on time lovely staff would definitely do this again over taking the train
thank you for all your assistance in the terrible jams on the rd july leaving the brexit ruined uk border system and for the courtesy and helpfulness of all your staff onboard on both the outbound and inbound legs of the crossing we will always use dfds in the future
horrible horrible customer service and no refund of cancelled tickets even though done in time the worst ferry company ever
no reason to take the dfds ferry to copenhagen if you have an alternative old boats small worn down cabins even the commodore and service is sub zero everyone in the restaurants looked as if they were forced to be there maybe not strange when you have to deal with drunk norwegians all week but still wont be back for a long time flying home
took an hour to get through security and passport control in dunkirk loading quite slow boat was an hour late ship quite clean and tidy journey smooth unloading seemed very quick all in all a good trip be happy to use dfds again
i ordered a minicruise trough takeoffer from copenhagen to oslo i called takeoffer and dfds before i ordered to know if the cruise was available in july or august and at the same time they told me that this offer was included the car when we arrived yesterday the car wasnt included the crew only said that we couldnt park the car without paying kr in the phone to the crew immediately the man in the phone said that we should give my whole credit card number with the security code also and that was the only way we could pay when we arrived on the boat and told them about this all that the crew on the ship had to say to this was that we should keep an eye with my card terrible experience and also bad service that we should pay more for the car then they told us
another successful trip to europe and back as usual on dock side very customer focused extremely helpful both sides of the channel on board excellent crews again very helpful all in all very good and definitely worth a return visit one point if only the uk customs control worked for dfds we might have got through in less than minutes which would have meant we would have boarded our designated crossing but luckily for us dfds where there to pick up the pieces
we travelled from dover to calais then back from dunkirk to dover a week later getting through the ports went very smoothly we arrived at dover quite early and were able to go on the pm ferry instead of the pm ferry we had booked great the outward journey was busy but we still had somewhere to sit and made use of the facilities on the way back it was quieter and we had a meal in the restaurant a negative point is that there needed to be a sign or announcement to say we couldnt buy anything from the shop after arriving in the port apparently it was in the small print of one of the dfds emails the shop was open and i had things i wanted to buy but wasnt allowed to otherwise the crossings went well and we would use dfds again
travelling in group by bicycle booking was a nightmare depending on the language you set the website in rules for taking bicycles arent the same max bicycle per booking in englishmax persons per bicycle in french also prices vary depending on the language settings prices are the same in as in because you need to book per bicycle you pay the same for an adult as for a child oh travelling by car is nearly the same price as by bicycle funny a kg car costs the same as kg total for bicycles finally getting at the checkin it took them min to sort out all the bookings oh and add another for a kg trailer in a world where travelling by bicycle should be encouraged it has really been discouraging to travel with dfds we also spent on phone calls with the customer service we should consider asking for a refunddfds are you listening
appalling communication tired looking cabins badly in need of a revamp and extortionately expensive to the point of gouging not impressed
despite a ferry delay on the return journey your local staff kept everyone upto date with the situation
a little disappointed with the way dogs are handled standing in front of the gate and despite having a valid ticket they dont let him onto the ferry even though he could have stayed in the car without any problems no suggestions as to how to proceed after several interventions i booked another ferry with stena line ferries to pick up my wife from the airport in time tomorrow great service at the beginning but weak when extraordinary problems arise in the end disappointing for me as i was really looking forward to entering oslo anyway stay flexible even if youre tall i speak from experience here
made the crossing from ijmuiden to newcastle three weeks ago we sailed back with stena line from harwich yesterday so we can now make a good comparison the dfds ship was a bit outdated and the cabin was small the toilet in our cabin also smelled a bit like urine nevertheless we had a nice trip the restaurant buffet is fantastic delicious fresh extensive and something for everyone this also applies to the breakfast buffet a nice lounge bar with a beautiful view of the sea we would definitely sail with dfds again next time and not with stena line ill leave that review there
ferry return trip calaisdover during holidays
the service between newhaven and dieppe is a very mixed bag it is abundantly clear that dfds put the needs of their freight passengers on a different level to normal car passengers also interesting that the follow up to our journey wasnt a how was it for you questionnaire but a thank you for travelling with us the worlds leading ferry operator with no interest in ascertaining whether we agreed with that statement and clearly we dont i dont have any gripes about on board services the staff are good and food and cabins etc as they should be what lets this service down so badly is boarding and disembarkation it takes too long on our arrival in newhaven the ferry was twenty minutes late it took more than an hour sitting in our car before we were able to disembark thats time i could have spent resting rather than watching trucks depart the return ferry to france had little freight which augured well we were amongst the first to board which sadly meant we were also the last to disembark despite arriving minutes ahead of schedule we did not leave the port until minutes later not a journey i ever intend to repeat
always a good experience my husband and i have often taken the oslo ferry mini cruise with great pleasure pleasant atmosphere and space will love a little away from families with children thats why the first trip with our son was still exciting but wait as we have now become one of those lame families with children we certainly also met activities and corners that suited our new family composition thank you dfds we would definitely like to sail with you again a wish could be in warning if on the trip from oslo towards kbh at something at night being woken up at frederikshavn even though we were going to kbh my son briefly thought it was an alarm
i was unhappy with the range of food choices available on both ferry journeys the options available were very poor with only an expensive restaurant a buffet restaurant and a cafe selling only cakes and pastries etc to choose from there was no where to buy an inexpensive light meal or sandwiches we found a better range of options on a minute ferry journey with scandlines ferry between germany and denmark during the same holiday with a canteen serving a range of hot and cold meals and snacks the service on dfds ferries previously was better when the cafe sold hot and cold sandwiches and light meals
overall service was good food prices were higher than expected around minutes delay for the calais to dover journey without any proper justification or information
although vessel is a bit tired looking the cabin was clean staff very friendly and cost of travel in peak summer time was affordable so no complaints no delays will travel again with dfds
excellent journey none of the queues expected from the news
really pleased to have arrived there hours early at to be informed that we can drive straight onto the ferry to dunkirk no issues at frontier control and very friendly and helpful booking agent in the dfds kiosk the ferry loading staff were happy and chatty whilst directing us into our parking slot the full english breakfast was surprisingly good and the new young lad hadnt managed to get sick of the never ending flow of guests and was very pleasant the only downside id have is that there were people sleeping all over the sofas in the restaurant im not a fan of eating my breakfast next to random snoring strangers either way thanks dfds i hope the return journey on the nd september will be as pleasant
this company provides ukrainian refugees with free ticket to gb and free lunch on the board big respect
there were no queues when we went just a half an hour queue for the paper checks but the gentleman there was very nice and helpful we were able to go onto the next ferry as we missed our original one the journey was very smooth and enjoyable overall the experience was great
there were a few of us who had been looking forward to a trip with you on when we had two gift cards we were first told that we couldnt because it was high season when i saw cases that it said that we could use them after on there was just a plus only a limited number for gift cards so stay far away from gift cards for dfds
it was unfortunate that hold up at uk border force caused a delay of mins on arrival in dover there was another hold up in berthig resultin in another min delay
smooth travel in both directions cabin very useful on late boat will certainly use again
having used dfds for their newhaven dieppe route multiple times in past this was seemingly a no brainer we initially booked as foot passengers before deciding wed bring the car along with us our initial support agent made an honest mistake in putting the car under my name as opposed to my partner we had separate booking references and to avoid any confusion or delays at the port we decided to reach out to rectify this the call we would then receive from a customer service agent was one of the most unprofessional dealings ive witnessed my partner was made to feel at fault for the error as if she was wasting dfds time and left the call feeling completely shaken the tone and manner in which the agent spoke was completely unprofessional out of line and uncalled for if we could cancel our journey with dfds we would unfortunately we are now locked in with a no refund policy and the only option of a travel credit id have considered this if we had any ambition to use dfds services again i am well aware passenger ships are dealing with backlogs and issues this week in particular im also aware dfds customer support has been inundated with tickets but there is no excuse for the service we received
what can i say hours to get off boat and through passport control in dieppe shockingly unacceptable completely spoilt what was otherwise a good experience would think again before rebooking
hello we have been with the ferry dfds ferry from oslo to frederikshavn ship crown seaways on monday at pm we had bought childrens climbing cardsyoungster cart for our children i think its too bad that it wasnt a lunch box a drinking bottle for our children we had a girl who was looking forward to getting it so she could show it to her support teacher and her friends in the class otherwise the other activities were great for the children they think it was really fun and they enjoyed being in the pool
booked for the fist time in years as my travel plans a week later changed i needed to cancel the ticket boom of the ticket value gone only breakfast refunded in the process i looked at the prices again and saw that my car would now week later have been less tried the chat it actually worked called customer service two times no available danish speaking cs employees it said started waiting as rd in line and waited for more than minutes that is not good service in the middle of the day dont book dfds unless you are sure you are going on that date they offer free cancellation with a flexticket but they do not even offer flexticket for these kind of ferries
very friendly checkin for many years at the dfd counter friendly staff great service good buffet on board clean cabins this time we were in newcastle over hours before departure yesterday at the first dfds counter we were put in the closed lane because of a flat roof box cm high big fuss we were told to wait to see if they could still take us we offered to take the roof box because we had a ticket we absolutely had to go then after an hour we got the message that we could go an additional payment of pounds ok but the same tickets for the car a receipt was not issued at my request instead the reservation was made again and then the surprise on the ship lots of space up top a bit of a shame all the fuss at the end of the trip felt a bit like harassment luckily a lovely crossing with the princess seaways as usual friendly service great buffet nice cabins after moving from deck to deck due to honking alarms so somewhat reconciled
we have travelled with dfds for over years newhavendieppe its a no frills old boat terrible food but you kind of expect that since tuesdays journey i will look to book the tunnel despite it being a longer drive from door to door the reason rude staff late boarding having to plead with staff to go and visit the dogs very long wait with slow inefficient border control and for the past two times we have arrived as one of the first cars and other times were last off the boat miserable journey that ruins the holiday feel thanks dfds our journey is over
overall i had no real issues with the crossing during the loading however myself and other trikesidecar riders were kept waiting a considerable time in the heat all bikes and many cars having been loaded over an hour earlier when we were loaded it was to be tucked in a corner that i wasnt convinced hadnt been accessible earlier we didnt have luxury of sheltered waiting
very smooth and trouble free experiance in our return trip from dover to calais left a bit more time than the recommended mins before departure which was a good idea as checkin took a little longer than that ferry was clean left and arrived on time and onboard facilities were all good what more is there to say it all just worked
great service as always all staff were excellent seeing that i was disabled the staff were so helpful in the restaurant and duty free i would not even consider booking with any other ferry line thank you
had to return home from holiday due to a medical emergency in the family got on a half empty ferry at short notice but was charged an extra very disappointed at the lack of empathy from dfds
only issue was disembarking at dover we had priority boarding and that worked well however at dover whilst cars either side of us were allowed off we were asked to wait until i finally waved the card hanging from the mirror the person moving the vehicles then said he couldnt see our card shrugged his shoulders and continued to move other cars seems pointless paying the extra for service we did not get perhaps different method of marking priority vehicles is required
compared with other ferries and the eurotunnel my dfds booking dover to dunkirk was the best value
very good service from the crew on shore and board and all facilities were clean and usable having said that we had two very pleasant crossings with no rough water my only observation is that the meal food was a bit dried out and we eat about halfway over on both crossings
is waiting in the blazing sun for hours both sides of the channel before sailing really necessary little or no shade very bad for the elderly pets and children also at dieppe my car was one of the first off the ferry but due to the ways the cars filter off i was the last out of the docks waiting over minutes in the queue good point salad in the restaurant was very nice
dfds used to be a flexible friendly way to get to france on a budget how that has changed on arriving early at dieppe with my wife struggling with a severe stomach bug i enquired about changing my crossing to an earlier one it seemed to be some sort of joke for the customer services operative who laughing told me it would cost to make a change not what i call customer service more like daylight robbery next year we will investigate alternatives to dfds when normally we just rebook as we have done for the last years or so
good timing and trip dont like duty free shoping mall on new ferry bonus being put on earlier ferry on return thanks
saturday ferry from dieppe was quite busy but went well enough however the price of food and drink was really excessive ukp for a small bag of peanuts euros for a pair of double gins well over twice what i paid earlier in france wont want to buy any more food and drink on this ferry
very serious and trustworthy i embarked on the soonest ferry saving me precious time the staff is very polite and well trained the services on board are very good and food is very tasty and the quantity is sufficient value for money
very pleased with service although took me hour ten to get off ship far too long then to have to go through customs
we booked this journey in we had to postpone this two times due to coronsvirus this year our car broke down during our drive to france we were not able to sail but we very much appreciate the way that dfds has handled this whole thing we will come back next year
we chose dfds over its rivals due to price return and the way some operators treat staff check in loading the journey staff availability of food all excellent big disappointment however was dunkirk terminal coming home from france empty vending machines no caf poor quality toilets on one of the hottest days of the year we couldnt even buy some chilled water very poor show dfds at least fill up your vending machines it was a saturday evening and not at all busy again loading and staff excellent but the lack of facilities and refreshments was a big minus point
on a busy summer saturday the ferry from dieppe departed and arrived on time a smooth crossing with refreshments available at not exorbitant prices
we have always traveled with dfds when going to europe much cheaper than other ferries and many a time have been put on an earlier one when leaving france
really pleased with service received from dfds the staff on board were helpful and the ferry was immaculate inside we will definitely be using them again they made the crossing to dunkirk very easy
i cannot commend dfds staff highly enough everyone was extremely helpful courteous and efficient from checkin i was travelling with my cats no problem boarding i required and immediately received assistance all the way from checkin to my cabin security i was carrying an item which needed to be handed into the steward for the duration of the crossing onboard staff information desk and buffet restaurant staff were all faultlessly courteous and helpful disembarking i again required assistance and it was promptly and efficiently delivered massive thank you for a very relaxing and smooth experience
arrived at dover am for am departure as dfds advised to allow plenty of time to check in dogs but everything done very quickly and put on earlier ferry new this season and very smart but the full english breakfast was unbelievably appalling barely cooked bacon something unrecognisable which was supposed to be a sausage a shrivelled tiny fried egg and one sided toast but hash browns and beans ok all this for an exorbitant
the crossing itself was fine and staff friendly but i am giving this a one star rating due to a total lack of staff at their customer support call centre having missed a ferry due to sudden industrial action i called to try and amend the ticket to a later ferry and after an hour had to give up after being at no in the queue for at least half an hour clearly i was only advancing up the queue as others gave up this was at around pm in the afternoon i then emailed and received a response three days later after i had already got back to the uk they are in breach of the consumer rights act which entitles consumers to services carried out with reasonable skill and care havingh noone at a call centre is a clear breajh of this
newcastle amsterdam return with car and family pleasantly surprised by the journey the ships princess seaways and king seaways are old and tired looking in places but perfectly comfortable all the staff we encountered were friendly and polite berth outside cabins are small but functional the outward journey was noisy due to being on deck with constant engine noise but the return journey we were on deck and forward facing which was much better the buffet restaurant was well stocked with a variety of food the only negatives were the expensive prices of the soft drinks could you consider providing tap water for free perhaps and that we were told on arrival at the restaurant that we only had hours before we had to vacate the table which felt rushed breakfast was also good we were moved to an additional area on the return journey as the main restaurant was full but this was just as good king seaways is the better ship it has an open deck at the front of the boast and a wildlife expert and room on board to spot sealife a brilliant addition we would use this route again especially if dfds manage to upgrade to newer vessels in time
we have used dfds previously and again were very happy with the overall service levels my only criticism is on points the overnight ferry from newhaven to dieppe arrives so very early and hardly provides time for a nights sleep it arrives at am whereas it use to be am we returned on a booked daytime ferry and had a lunch of fish chips which were disappointingthey were cold
it was a very pleasant experience no complaints whatsoever great ship to be on for hours
a lot didnt work when we were going home from oslo with pearl the machines for check in were not working we were checked in manually but given cabins just above the engine and when we complained they wouldnt change it they claimed that all cabins were occupied so there was no option to upgrade i had a hard time believing that as the boat didnt seem as full as when we set sail the gangway didnt work and we were let in via the car deck the bed linen was the worst i have seen it looked like someone had slept in the beds there was no soap at the sink either outside or at home in the toilet on deck the door step is so high that i fell over it onto the floor i saw another lady come flying out the door but she was grabbed by one now ive woken up with bruises and a headache after a night of excruciating engine noise think that dfds will take money for a cabin that is not suitable for sleeping in or staying in perhaps the environmental protection agency should look into it on the way out the stairs were blocked by passengers waiting to get out nor is it safe in terms of security in the passport control in oslo there was only person at work so it took hour to get out of the terminal the cows scurried away too bad for those who only have half a day in oslo we came home with corona we think the long queue in oslo at the exit is the reason it is advisable to wear a mask everywhere on the ferry at the buffet and in the long corridors without ventilation
everything about the crossing was fine the price was very competitive
due to a closure of the m in scotland for three hours me and my pregnant girlfriend and at least or other cars arrived at the ferry terminal minutes after the checkin closed even though we all called to tell that we were stuck in traffic forever and would arrive a bit late they didnt wait minutes for us and didnt allow us on the boat anymore even though it wouldnt leave in the next minutes because of this we were forced to rebook to dover and drive at least km extra to get home given the special circumstances i would expect a bit more flexibility and customer service from the company what is a minute delay on a trip of hours
i have been sailing with you since the prince hamlet days never had to complain
we were going to hike the white cliffs of dover had bought and paid for a ticket from dunkirk ticket for three people and a single bicycle in france the bike punctures and we ride to the ferry without a bike the missing bike means we will be rejected at the ferry we see other passengers boarding with a bicycle but without a quotvehiclequot you cannot sail along we call dfds the french at the ferry wont help us and ask if we really have to rent a bike to get on board here it is explained that we must have three bicycles to get three people on the ferry our ticket says one bicycle and on the website it is not described that it requires one vehicle per person person it seems like a strange policy and especially because you can buy a ticket that does not give you access to the ferry we didnt get to dover as planned we got the money refunded because dfds admits that there are errors in their system
traveling dover to dunkirk by car with passengers on a monday at pm despite the low traffic time we had to queue fr mind at the dfds checkin it seems to take ages to check in the buses full of schoolchildren in front of us however as we were hrs early we were booked on an earlier ferry well done the ferry itself had been renovated we have sailed with dfds for yrs and know the boats and looked nice but the service experience left us with mixed emotions staff was friendly but clearly exhausted as there were staff shortages absolutely everywhere to maximise profits from the beginnig there was a queue of leading to and inside the restaurant waiting time almost an hour as a result sandwiches were out after mins only one till was ipen unbelievable at the same time the alternative outlet the cafe was closed although the boat was crowded with people on the other hand meals are still available for including a drink which is comparatively ok of course the clever guys at dfds know that people dont have any alternative crossing the channel as pos layoff from hell and irish ferries just as devastating service experience selling tickets for boats only operating one which is in scrapyard condition with the worst staff in the budiness leave customers with only one choice of ferry operator and the tunnel in a nutshell not too bad dfds but you need to hire lots of new restaurant staff to provide at least a decent service quality compared to your competition you are miles ahead
should i cancel my journey i attempted to book copenhagen to oslo on the dfds norwegian language booking site using the translation services of the google chrome browser i paid the deposit and received a verification entirely in norwegian using translation software i discovered that i am booked from oslo to copenhagen not from copenhagen to oslo this may have been my error i am unable to contact customer service when i send an email message i receive an automated response saying that they are very busy and may take several days to reply my final payment deadline is july i do not live in europe and i am unable to call a customer service number in norway i can call using whatsapp but i do not have a dfds whatsapp phone number i am posting this message in the hope that the response from dfds on this site will be faster than their customer service office my booking number included with this message has a link to my current telephone number please inform me if i am able to change to the correct direction of travel or whether i must cancel the boking thank you
mostly ok on board experience was pretty good pre boarding involved a long wait after passing customs etc there were no facilities for those waiting no coffee no snacks no lavatories and no information about boarding times boat arrived on time but it was over an hour before cars were able to disembark and get through the passport checks the latter is not dfds responsibility but you must have some influence with the border agency guichets for a couple of hundred cars is inadequate
ive used dfds for many years sadly the newhaven dieppe crossing is not as well managed as it could be i always arrive early to be sure to be the first off the boat at my destination dieppe port officials have their own ideas despite being the first car to check in ours was one of the last to embark and disembark i asked the dfds crew who said they have no control over the way in which dieppe port staff direct the cars once they have passed through the douane why why can the staff in dieppe add an hour to my journey time and the first line of cars row the last to embark despite our being the first to arrive and checkin this is wrong
arrived early very helpful lady got us on a earlier ferry crew could have not been more friendly or helpfulwill be sailing with you next year
bad indicate that you come early so you can get on board faster there was a random loading at about pm cars that had just arrived were allowed on board immediately and others had to wait more than two and a half hours four person cabin where the two of you couldnt even stand properly the shower and toilet were worthless and the curtains could not be closed no that is not worth that much money better from the corner of holland you have to drive further but it is certainly worth it also shorter travel time no we thought the dfds was very bad there is one bright spot the food was good
bought a deal certificate for a minicruise from to oslo because i had seen they had space on but couldnt use them i could after the holidays when the price was the same as deal i dont want to buy anything from them anymore as the customer service finally just didnt care and they didnt state that the vouchers could only be used on certain dates probably why only had been sold when i bought i can also see that there are more people who are dissatisfied with the trip to oslo so i am returning my deal vouchers and do not want to travel with dfds anymore
disappointed with both the charge given for changing ferries due to an emergency and the customer service to pay at calais port as a result i use the channel crossing a fair amount so will look to take my business elsewhere in the future
we arrived a bit early for the crossing from dunkirk to dover before i could ask i was offered an earlier crossing ditto on the way back if i didnt want to go from dover to calais boat left earlier and the crossing was also shorter boarding went well and departure was right on time until next time
our return ferry left on time but was minutes late arriving at dover there were no explanations as to why otherwise the trip was excellent and the premium lounge just what we needed thank you
id been looking forward to reviewing dfds as their help desk in the uk had been extremely helpful my problems occurred when i had the misfortune of speaking to margot on their french desk thirty minutes of surly indifference on the phone led to her withdrawing a large sum from my account and saying shed issue another ticket she didnt so got to the port and had to pay another large sum i will be complaining
i use the dfds dover to calais sailings or times per year and travel with our dog the service has always been great but i would say its now simple outstanding the crew onboard are clearly very professional and know how to deliver first class customer service the ships are fantastic always very clean and the restaurant and shop areas are always well stocked the greeting when you arrive on deck is fantastic and no matter what questions you have it always answered the staff at the booths when entering the ports couldnt be more helpful to and are always smiling
feedback on a mini cruise the ship appeared very run down and the crew was not like in the good old days they were unprofessional and sat in the guests areas crowded into the elevator so an elderly couple had to wait it has obviously become so bad for dfds that they employ mostly polishspeaking staff which made me feel that sea safety is still a priority for you as they could notwould not speak danish we had bought a commodore cabin that had been patched with gauze and ear cleaners in the curtains there was obvious human remains on the langs and when staying in oslo there was no change of towels or new supplies of soap or drink actually dont know what i paid more for as there was definitely no commodore over the trip other than a good breakfast on our restaurant visit we were greeted both evenings with a reluctance from the staff when we arrived ringing and waiting for the clock to be pm for minutes and being told that it is despite the fact that you can see several empty tables that look ready perhaps a natural thing for you but a rude answer like quotthose minutes mean everything to usquot is of no use to me i am just completing an assessment of dfds and stena and color line which we have carried out from kiel and in my danish heart i took dfds in the end to get the best experience which is far from dfds is like sas luxury that has come about under discount to ring and wait for the clock to be for minutes and be told that thats how it is despite the fact that you can see several empty tables that look clear maybe a natural thing for you but i cant use a rude answer like quotthe minutes mean everything to usquot
we have travelled many times from dover to calais with different ferry companies but dfds is definitely the best the staff from check in to check out are polite friendly and professional on both journeys we were put on the earlier ferries with no fuss or additional charge the ferries are clean and look newly refurbished with plenty of seating excellent
had to change departure date tried their phone line but no one ever bothers to answerso i sent an email to which they did reply and stated there would be a charge for the changefair enough i thought however when i turned up after a hour drive from bordeaux they charged me an extra said it was not part of the original deal had i been made aware i would of gone to another port but obviously this is part of their tacticsnot really the way to treat their regular customers but luckily this happened before my family an inlaws are all off to france in august thats not far off k in business theyve lost i will certainly not be using dfds again but on the plus side at least i will be able to get wifi and decent cup of coffee on the portsmouthcaen crossing
we have used dfds for our crossing from newhaven to dieppe many times the ferry is always clean and comfortable and the food is excellent always leaves on time and arrives on time good service
trips both left and arrived late not by much but still late ships had recently been upgraded but apparently no one thought of putting plug sockets in the cafeteria to plug a toaster in so you cant get toast or bread with breakfast anymore i have used buses planes and trains recently where they all have usb sockets but apparently not on ships think dfds missed a trick there both sailings were pleasant and crew very helpful
good crossing very friendly staff at the port and onboard the ferry somehow we always arrive in good time but end up almost the last car off the ferry given that passports need checking that offloading process is very slow
good access to ports check in staff was efficient and prompt on both sectors loading the car was efficient on both sectors the cafeteria has a good selection of hot and cold food the duty free is well replenished with spirits gifts confectionary the seats are comfortable however some need some attention reclining buttons missing switching or dimming the lights in seating area would be a plus during the night crossing outbound the disembarkation at newhaven took h we arrived h early in dieppe and were in nd lane half way and we ended up the very last car to be disembarked as we were parked on the upper floor the value for the crossings is good
all the members of staff were helpful and polite the ferry was clean tidy and orderly the basic cabin was comfortable and clean the food was good if slightly expensive
ferry was on time clean toilets and good duty free however the price for a full english breakfast was a bit steep nearly for an average breakfast and a smallish coffee last year august i had a splendid fish and chips on board
i was due to travel from newcastle to amsterdam last saturday but was unfortunately denied boarding because it was more than days after my second vaccine and i havent had a booster jab i was denied due to restrictions in amsterdam and they dont accept lateral flows this was no fault to dfds but still they gave me a refund which by all rights they probably didnt need to the woman behind the counter clearly felt bad for us but there was nothing she could do will rebook in the future
there is a telephone number on the site but it is not in use if due to circumstances you have to leave early with the ferry you cannot properly contact us which is very annoying you can email but that takes forever to get an answer and therefore doesnt work be reachable dfds
i thought the service was excellent in particular the staff on board were very helpful and polite there was a delay in the boarding process at dunkirk which lead to a hour delay on the return journey other than that all very good
very nice transport it is a little expensive but it was a pleasant transfer
this was my first ever trip on a ferry and driving too flawless from start to finish the ground and onboard staff were excellent kind and courteous sailing back i got to enjoy stunning views too cant wait to travel again with you on th july
i travelled as a foot passenger from newhaven my small suitcase was put on a trailer i wasnt told that i wouldnt see it again until our arrival in dieppe there were things in it that i needed during the crossing i had to wait for an hour to retrieve the case and one of the wheels was damaged there were no taxis at the port no contact details for taxi companies and unhelpful staff
my flight with easyjet to nantes got cancelled and im glad to have been able to travel to france for a friends and family reunion and book my trip with dfds within a very short notice at very affordable price including a cabin plus a bathroom very clean tidy and i even had a good hours sleep each way onboard the service was good as well as the food the staffs very approachable and willing to help too it looks like dfds have looked after their staff during covid pandemic
first time sailing on a ferry and fears of the water had a amazing time dfds people working made me feel comfortable and relaxed would definitely travel with them again amazing experience
great service i was running late so was able to take up the flexible one later ship option clean ship good service food was much better years agobut times have got harder and a food service is still offered overall still happy been using dfds often since early s can recommend
kielklaipedakiel misleading signs at departure suggest that checkin takes place in the vehicle but thats not the case you have to go to the terminal the outside cabins are well cleaned the evening meal is bad canteen food the breakfast is good the staff at the checkin and instructing on the vehicle deck are also good the procedure for driving and parking on the ferry with a camper van is a challenge and whatsapp only works to a limited extent both in normal and streaming mode speaking of which the motorcyclists also had to queue for a long time in the heat
excellent all round service staff on board ferry friendly helpful excellent food options dfds is by far our favourite ferry operator
although service did not appear to be particularly busy there were minutes delays in both directions otherwise very good
we been booked a flexi ticket and travelled a day early with no problem great loading and departed on time ship clean and quiet on a thursday morning we used premier lounge which was peaceful but not necessary really as ship was quiet
this is the first time we have used the doverdunkirk crossing it was very pleasant and relaxed the ship was very comfortable and clean and that made the journey very relaxing and very spacious we will definitely used the dfds car ferry crossing again keep up the good customer service well done
this is our second sailing with you since the p o debacle our experience on both have been good the guy on checkin at dover this last time was very cheery and helpful explaining in more detail how your system works and putting us on a ferry to calais instead of dunquerque which is where i had mistakenly booked to onboard facilities were good although i havent yet found a separate lounge the initial long queues for coffee and food might have been helped with more than one cashier who was doing a sterling job btw we have been crossing the channel several times a year for more than thirty years and look forward to the possibility of a frequent sailing scheme thank you
everything went as smoothly as usual the boat was very cleanas usual noting to fault
a good crossing boarded promptly and staff friendly and polite have used this crossing newhaven dieppe as we refuse to use po any more would definitely use this crossing again
excellent trip hassle free and compared to brittany ferries so much cheaper and affordable definitely will be traveling dfds again from newhaven this year and for the foreseeable future hope it continues to be affordable service to france
i have not travelled on dfds before we have returned from france using various routes including calais dover and rotterdam hull the dfds route from amsterdam to newcastle was the route we enjoyed this time the whole experience was very professional we chose the commanders cabin which came with a sea view for a ferry the cabin was spacious and had all the facilities to make for a comfortable night at sea the shower was of a good size and overall the accommodation was comfortable and allowed us a very good nights sleep we booked dinner at h jethro was our personal waiter he was excellent and could not do enough for us we enjoyed watching the sun go down at dinner and the sun come up over the sea the next morning we really enjoyed our time on board for the return trip we nearly missed our boarding time do adequate research on the location of the docks we arrived minutes after the check in time but we were allowed to drive on the return voyage was equally good and we made use of the well stocked duty free shop we had an issue with our notebook and wifi the night staff were very helpful and ensured that we were able to get a wifi connection overall we would strongly recommend this service from dfds
we are on the sailing from dover to calais on june passport control was a breeze the guy on the dfds kiosk checking us in was so friendly and very efficient boarding was smooth and the ship is immaculate so clean ok so we left around mins late but that was due to late arrival of irish ferries ship blocking harbour so far so good update excellent crossing and really quick and efficient offloading thank you dfds
hassle free ferry crossings extremely easy check in and out efficient and clear directions helpful and courteous staff star service
travel newhavendieppe back on a regular basis boarding was straighforward and the boat left on time there was a good selection of food available the staff were all very friendly and the service was great the boat was clean and even though it was busy it didnt feel overcrowded an excellent service as always
although a great crossing which weve used many times two things were not up to the high standard weve come to expect we always use the evening sailing and order fish and chips at the restaurant which has in the past been an excellent way to start the holiday on this occasion it was horrible our fish was dry and inedible and the chips seemed to be preheated from the day before secondly we always buy duty free on the return leg gin being our favourite although we were first in when the shop opened not one bottle of gin was on the shelves even though the promotion posters were all over the ship there was little else in the alcohol range to choose from we were told restocking would be on friday this was on wednesday fat lot of good that was for us dfds seriously need to up their game we expected better after several years of not being able to travel
firstly very disappointed that the frequent travellers tickets have been stopped as somebody who has to cross regularly i will now be checking the other ferry companies to see if they do them also i was unable to connect with the wifi throughout the journey as although full bars were present the option to signin never presented itself despite restarting my devices the shopping trolleys in the shop are not designed for boxes of wine as second box kept tipping out causing the trolley to slam to the ground
everything simply appalling not fit for purpose treating passengers like fools i will be writing the chief executive torrent carlson he should so be ashamed of his employees performance or lack of it
friendly staff ferry old but ok and gets you from ab on board price for food is high but crossing cost is low a good clean on board world help as well but for what you pay good value for money
after the debarkle of easy jet we decided to try the ferry for the first time boarding great the ferry great the crossing great off loading great we have a daughter and now grandaughter miles into france near nantes we will never fly again it will allways be the ferry from newhaven highly recomend
it was good to be on a busy crossing with many more travellers than in recent times vessel loaded late and sailed late from dieppe and arrived late at newhaven which makes a long onward journey even longer apart from that this service does what it says on the ticket
easy to book did not have to wait long crossing was sooth and embarkdisembark was smooth
by motorbike one way calais dover thats what i call cheeky ive often deliberately taken the ferry return trip for gbp through the tunnel certainly saved an hour and no unfriendly reprimands from the staff thats how you scare away your customers and support the shuttle congratulations but the trip was still worth it
it couldnt be worse on the way there we missed the ferry because of billing problems on the way back despite reaching the terminal hours before departure we missed the ferry because the employees were stupid when scanning our passports when we pointed out the driving times there was no apology nor was there even an attempt to get on the booked ferry i wish the company continued failure bad luck and mishaps because i will never be with them again
a good serviceavoids the chaos of dover and better prices than brittany ferries
speedy boarding worked on the way back staff friendly and helpfulsimple option meals good idea and tasty outside options too restrictive and smoky noting the boat was quite empty the way out was a disaster and only one car booth was open and third queuing delay was unnecessary
great all round experience staff helpful if required and nice manor with everyone good efficient ferry company and good value fares available to everyone
good service also when arriving early they put you on a earlier boat no hassle at all
ferry was fine long wait to board and we arrived before as requested and nothing happened before the available seating was adequate food and drink available was ok long wait to disembark after being asked to go to the car no communication after that gents toilets horrible and smelly no apparent cleaning during crossing
dont never ever trust the advertisement about refund money if you cancel your tripi had a very serious family issue i have to cancel my trip and i pay return from dover to calais when i ask them for a refund they email me saying no refundso go within different ferry company dont go with dfds at all they are a scammer
took a long time to board at newcastle buffet meal on both sailing wasnt to the standard of previous crossings held on the car deck for minutes when disembarking at newcastle disappointed with overall experience ive used this crossings for the past years definitely feels like standards have deteriorated
i had a lovely trip with dfds the ferries are nice the staff are helpful and the checkin process is really smooth i do have to note that there were no vegan menu options on the trip to dieppe i didnt check on the way back despite the menu have a vegan section which said vegetable lasagne when i enquired about this i was told that it had dairy in making it veggie not vegan also when i booked there was no availablity for the time i wanted for my outward journey so i booked a later one which was fine but the evening before spaces became available which was great but then there was so way for me to switch it despite the cost being the same online i tried to call but the phone center closes at or on a friday different places say different things and doesnt reopen until monday morning i understand call centres need to close but some assistance in adjusting journeys even if i could just do it online would have been great as it was i just bought a new ticket and got on the earlier ferry
we have traveled the newhavendieppe route for many years now during the pandemic we were able to travel to visit an elderly relative in france dfds could not have been more helpful in booking trips amending trips and in looking after us even when we were the only passengers on the ship
very nice staff from kiosk to leaving the ferry i use the ferry every weeks on my bicyle and allways enjoy my journey
ferry crossing was on time and disembarkation reasonably quick we were lucky others must have taken ages to clear customs annoying that cylists and motorbikes pushed to the front for passport clearence meal not served hot not value for money reclining chairs readily available but not all mechanism s worked
fantastic day out across to dunkirk on coach from dover priory to ferry terminal both dfds staff accompanying coach french danielle and local englishman were very professional and handled all formalities and paperwork efficiently the sterling round trip fare was admirably offset by meal vouchers each worth issued gratis for the round trip ferry was clean and well found a nice day out and highly recommended thank you dfds and anderson coach services
i really hope dfds will read this review the ferry ride was ok but when it comes to diner i would be more happy to buy a asda chiken then the powerful herbs aromatic meat with chips they offer for and the bathrooms are so bad the only one toilet available was so soiled of poo and urine i would prefer to poo myself than use those facilities
dfds is simply a great company during the corona crisis they have already reimbursed a crossing without any hassle and now they are showing again that they have an understanding side we were soon going to newcastle with dfds but my girlfriend had an accident so the trip could not go ahead unfortunately we did not take out cancellation insurance so i feared the worst email sent to dfds with proof of the accident hoping for some form of leniency i was called back hours later by an extremely friendly employee who was completely willing to help the trip can now be rebooked for for limited change costs companies with a quotsocial sidequot are extremely rare as far as im concerned dfds is definitely one of them
absolutely selfish decision making from dfds at calais port on arriving at check in more than mins before our scheduled departure we were told we have to get a later ferry and no consideration for our circumstances upon discussion the reason they quoted a hour time frame through checks no advance warning given eg by email or sms and in fact we made it through in less than mins being in our allocated boarding lane with mins remaining to the departure of our originally scheduled ferry we saw everyone boarding that one but despite requesting ground staff we were told we cant join them first we were told there is no space and then we were told this would delay departure of the ferry neither of which make any sense plus there was zero regard given to the difficulties faced by customers as a result in terms of impact on health work etc so wed strongly advise to avoid dfds they even tried to shift the blame on to calais port staff during our discussion
after a cancelled flight from schipol in this weekends travel chaos we managed to get a last minute booking on the overnight ferry from imujden to newcastle we turned up at the terminal after a morning of stress and rushing for a taxi to be on time with no real knowledge of what we had signed up for the lady at the terminal was so kind and patient talking us through all of the arrangements and staff on the ship were also very helpful with advice about our ongoing travel arrangements from newcastle the cabin was spotlessly clean the buffet was very good and the staff on board a credit to the company including a wonderful security guard who lent me his personal reading book when i enquired about any left in lost property to pass the time considering it was a stressful situation the experience on the ship made the change of plan pleasant and preferable to flying thanks to all
absolutely appalling it doesnt matter what time or day you come these days it will take you more than minutes to get through all check points with on both the dover and dunkirque side an minute wait from arrival at port till you reach the first entry gate into the port but not yet through all other checks dfds blames customs customs blame dfds appalling experience and will start traveling on different operator route
awful company arrived for a booked ferry and given our boarding pass and only after driven off did we realise they had bumped us to a later sailing they did this without telling us and then sent us an email saying our booking had been changed still no idea why would avoid using again
due to illness i was forced to cancel my newhaven to dieppe crossing hours before i was due to depart the crossing cost me they charged me a cancellation fee it is nice to see that capitalism without a moral conscience is still flourishing in the uk
beware traveled on a mini cruise from frederikshavn to oslo on was contacted hour after arrival in oslo that the boat could not return us to frederikshavn due to the weather conditions we could choose to stay in oslo until the next day at own expense and could the boat then dock in frederikshavn or take us to kbh after which the journey home from here was also at own expense we received no help at all from dfds we didnt get the breakfast in compensation and we are now left with the costs of a taxi flight kbhaalborg and collection of our car in frederikshavn never travel with dfds again
i was on a trip from copenhagen to oslo a few weeks ago i had a week off and thought it would be a good way to start the holiday since i have been on board the ferry for approx hour i get a shard of glass in my foot i turn to the counter who gets hold of a samaritantrained member of staff he tries to get this shard of glass out but doesnt have tools small enough of course he regrets it when i subsequently get home i write to dfds and they deny that this has even taken place and they insist that there are tools on board to for example take out a splinter which there was not the service on board was ok even though they couldnt help me but the subsequent correspondence ive had with customer service has been simply awful
booking a ticket on dfdscom was not smooth the link to the tcs is dead so you have to click accept without reading them the telephone number charges you for calling them and then keeps you on hold so i didnt wait around as i am not willing to pay to listen to their hold music immediately upon booking i received two emails one confirming the booking and a second email arrived at the same time saying the booking had been altered the second email was not expected as i had not altered the booking indeed the emails arrived simultaneously so i could not have changed the booking in that time after booking you then need to enter passenger details again after booking and this form crashed too when i came to retry it said the details were already submitted so i dont know if they are submitted or not now awaiting an email reply to all these problems
what the dfds employees allow themselves to do when loading onto the ferry can really no longer be described as service nobody assigns vehicles to any rows instead it is pure anarchy in the small minds of the loaders once again vehicles that were there early were not loaded until very late hours of waiting time while other vehicles of the same category have long been loaded the employees on the loading decks then get hectic and complain because things are not going fast enough for them unfortunately there is no alternative to this shipping company on some routes in the future i will definitely do everything i can to avoid dfds
was on a oneday trip from frederikshavn to oslo and it was a purely stressful trip when we walked the streets of oslo where we only had approx hours to walk around we were called hour after we arrived and were told that the boat would not dock in frederikshavn on the return trip due to the weather it was blowing at about msec in gusts and because frederikshavn harbor is obviously too small and difficult for them to back into they dropped frederikshavn the boat therefore only sailed to copenhagen we could choose to stay in oslo and take the boat home the next day at the same time but the overnight stay in oslo was at our own expense really call service the cheapest place cost a good nok per person or we could sail along and end up in copenhagen where we would have to find transport home to frederikshavn in north jutland all by ourselves they would subsequently refund the train tickets hope it will be an easy process we chose the latter but there was pure stress and confusion for us on the boat who had to return to the car in frederikshavn it was a long way from copenhagen to frederikshavn and we got no help or customer care at the counter on board the ferry as if they had never experienced it before we should have been in frederikshavn at at night but we sailed the extra hours towards copenhagen so we asked for free breakfast tickets now that we were forced to sail the extra hours towards copenhagen instead of frederikshavn but none help to get there they didnt just share the wifi on board with their guests it was very expensive nok for hour of wifi they could also choose to give that to their stressed customers now that they were forced to sail an extra hours it was the least they could do to make happy guests who were otherwise under a lot of pressure so we skipped breakfast for nok per person on the boat and found something to eat on the go in when we got to copenhagen here we had to take a train to the main station onward by train to aarhus where we were put on a train bus to randers from randers we got on a train to aalborg and here we once again had to find a new form of transport on to frederikshavn so it suddenly became an insanely long trip home we started the trip at in frederikshavn on sunday evening and should have been back in frederikshavn hours later but we just added extra hours of transport time before we landed in frederikshavn again our trip of hours was pure transport time for us minus the hours in oslo where we got stressed quite quickly since they called us i dont think the hours was worth the whole trip so be careful if you sail from frederikshavn if its windy you wont be transported back to frederikshavn but will instead be dropped off in copenhagen
i bought a wrong route ticket and didnt realise it until a week later i thought id wasted and i couldnt get it back however dfds customer support helped me change the route of my ticket and i didnt have to buy a new ticket what a relief thank you very much
excellent service our car battery had gone when we tried to start the engine and we were stuck in the ferry the crew were amazing and helped us really friendly and got us some jump leads that didnt seem to work and then called for something else super helpful stars will be booking again thank you
used dfds for the first time from dover to calais return have used p o hundreds of times but have to say these were the best ferry crossings i have enjoyed two complaints only no captain welcome no safety announcements otherwise very clean and comfortable will definitely use dfds in future
damage to the car during boarding due to incorrect pilotage filled in the damage form and then you think everything will be fine unfortunately damage was determined upon return by an expert but emails telephone calls and registered letters are not answered by dfds no more traveling with dfds for us
we used dfds for the st time today it was the crossing from calais to dover the staff is extremely kind caring and attentionate the ferry was very nice comfortable and clean including the toilets the duty free store is also nice the crossing was smooth absolutely delighted
we had received a gift card that we wanted to use after a longer search we find out that it will cost us dkk more to use a gift card for the trip than to book the trip on a promotional offer we can read up on their site if you already have a trip gift vouchers can be made so that the money can be used on board the ferry in a bar etc good we book promotional offers and write to customer service we would like to use gift vouchers on the ferry we have quick response from customer service helpful would like all the information now someone new in customer service who replied that gift cards cannot be converted into vouchers for the ferry asking until why when it is now on the page and there is nothing about what kind of gift card can be used if we can find a solution solution quotyou can cancel your trip and get the money backquot this is the solution that exists nothing to see if anything can be done to help or explanation of what gift card they think can be converted into a voucher so no turn for us anyway
have been using dfds for years and they are by far the best ferry service for crossing the channel they couldnt be more helpful and cant recommend them enough
despite a shaky start due to the uncertainty of the booking process once the system was in place dfds was amazingly supportive samantha w from newcastle was particularly helpful and even phoned me a couple of times to assist with the booking the terminal office in ijmuiden was very supportive and helpful with the frequent changes to the booking due to issues relating to the home office letter to travel process i cant recommend dfds highly enough and personally future travels by car to europe will start and finish in newcastle the ferry experience is a great way to start and finish a journey thank you dfds on behalf of sponsors and ukranian refugees
i had bought a trip for my mother and my son but they arrived too late for the trip as my mother was sure they were sailing as usual they sailed two hours earlier which they had also been good at informing about nevertheless we got the entire trip moved to the following week without having to pay anything extra its service thank you dfds you are awesome and my mom and son are looking forward to the trip
we have just changed our ferry crossing time to arrive in england earlier than planned and cannot praise the lady from newcastle who dealt with our call enough absolutely brilliant her customer service is have sailed newhaven to dieppe now several times and would not travel with any other company keep up the good work dfds and please make sure our praise is passed on to your lovely staff in the newcastle office
customer service is very bad trying to use a voucher for a crossing they cancelled proved to be a nightmare there was no voucher code and the price was the same without the voucher when i tried to check out online i end up having to phone the number it said to contact which turned out to be a premium rate one and due to the shilly shallying of the person on the other end its not letting me do this and thatoh ive put the wrong bus transfer date in blah blah blah i will have to put you on hold twice the call cost me over finally she ended the call to sort it out and sent me a ticket and invoice which would have cost more then going on eurostar by the time i factored in the rip off train fare to the port so i never finished paying to use the ticket ive been using dfds for a while and have noticed prices are rocketingwhen it is them that have cancelled the crossing the price should be the same as what the pasenger paid at the time for another berth not a load more money on top
i have not yet sailed the trip i ordered but it has just dawned on me that you really dont have anything like a day in oslo hence this review and a consideration of canceling the trip again you put in at and before you are down in the city maybe minutes will pass the boat sails again at pm and you must be at the table by pm at the latest therefore you have to walk towards the boat approx pm depending on where you are in the city so you really have from pm ish in oslo ie hours you can therefore just manage to find a restaurant and have lunch and not much else what has become of the day you once had i seem to remember that once they docked a little earlier and didnt have to board again until the late afternoon i felt trapped when it dawned on me and am actually considering canceling the trip if i want to sail approx in day i can get from hirtshals to the faroe islands in not much longerso in other words its not the boat trip im doing it for been there done that
travelled as a family of four two children ages we went from newcastle to amsterdam overnight and it was an awful trip the cabin noise was so loud my air pods gave a warning the noise level was over dcp which apparently is unsafe for human ears we had to shout to each other and no one slept our first day in amsterdam we slept i contacted dfds to request a refund for the awful service and was basically told it was my fault for not making staff aware at the time they acknowledge there is noise in certain lower cabins but as i did not complain at the time tough they went on to say the ship was far from full so i could have been moved why was i even put there why not put everyone on the upper levels why not provide details i could have got ear plugs i would have complained but there was a language barrier with all the staff i met very poor experience and terrible customer servicei will not use them again
booked a crossing with a cabin done it loads of times with brittany ferries no problems boarded and was told i would need to share a cabin with total strangers disgusting treatment and that was with signs everywhere saying masks are mandatory
travelled from dover to calais on friday th april advised check in would be mins however border control queues were stagnant with six lanes going in to with only french border force staff its no surprise we missed the ferry as cars for the ferry hours after ours had also joined hours early however these issues lie with the port authority during the queues dfds reassured us and booked us on to the next ferry in moments once through it was straight through to the dock and in minutes embarking on to the next ferry we were amazed to say hello to the person handling their social media staff port side were incredibly friendly and helpful which helped to alleviate our frustrations with border force on what they knew would be a busy bank holiday weekend the colleague in the premium lounge was attentive and welcoming will travel with dfds for all futures crossings
we are leaving on the oslo cruise today in hours we have used a travel credit from our trip that was canceled last year due to the corona shutdown this morning we get a call from customer service who says we havent paid for the trip their online booking regarding the use of travel credit did not work in january when we wanted to hear about its use so we called customer service and got help there she wanted to transfer our credit to the new booking so they havent done that despite the fact that it is their fault and it is clear that we have not used the over dkk we paid in customer service lets us know that they doubt that we have paid for our new booking we have a lot of emails to confirm this but they dont care we dont know before our trip if they will charge the amount again or if the ticket will work on the ferry it is not a good and relaxing way to start your easter holiday dfds should train their customer quotservicequot to communicate better take responsibility for their mistakes and apologize instead of blaming the customer for their mistakes practice
staff in both ijmuiden port of tyne and on board were great ambassadors is a word i would use to describe them online staff worse than useless unable and unwilling to offer a refund for the coach transfer in the netherlands despite it being advertised as being included in the minicruise package i was charged for the transfer adding a significant cost to the trip i booked the trip and paid for the cabins expecting the transfer to be included within the price not paying pp total cost in each direction emailed the dfds team got no response chased them again and eventually got a response which wasnt really worth waiting for the follow up wasnt either quote from the dfds website transfers are included in the cost of the mini cruise however they will appear as a separate charge when you book this is not an additional cost except they are an additional cost fare breakdown and payments amsterdam mini cruise break bed sea view cabin bunk beds gbp gbp total calculated price gbp the price on the website for the booking was so you can clearly see that the transfer isnt included and it is an additional cost despite making numerous requests for the refund guess what they refuse to ive sent screenshots links to their website and also attached the booking confirmation yet still the penny doesnt drop undoing all the good work port and onboard crew have done in an era when competitors are struggling and goodwill would go a long way they seem insistent on not realising that wont use again and would recommend to avoid unless you too want to be sold something that is advertised incorrectly having first sailed with the company under the scandinavian seaways banner back in it is a shame to see my experiences soured by this false advertising and total lack of ownership in resolving the problems as a side note screenshots show theyve updated their website within the last few hours the quote referred to above wasnt there on the th april at its there now at on th april
hugely expensive on the boats both the price level but also that it runs in danish terms i just as well bought my aftershave at glasmagasinet in oslo when we returned to oslo apart from this great boats and nothing negative from me
i have been using dfds to travel back and forth between france and the uk for over years now and i am extremely satisfied their prices are unbelievably low compared to other companies without having to compromise on quality of service the process to book and board is very smooth boats are always on time cabins are always clean the staff is very nice and helpful whether at reception the terminal on the phone or on board i live in london and come to caen and cherbourg yet always do the extra miles to cross the channel in dieppe with dfds and i will keep doing so
so youve ruined our planner we were supposed to travel tomorrow from kbh to oslo and everything was planned for us the hotel room at the hotel was also booked but then we couldnt pay because your website didnt work the payment cannot be completed blah blah we tried in the morning and again in the morning we tried on the mobile and then we switched to the computer we also tried with visa and mastercard but quotthe payment cannot be completedquot and then you recommend that we send the email if the journey is to take place within the next hours but it also says that you are very busy it also says on the page that if you cant make the payment yourself and you need help then you have to pay dik instead of paying dik to book online and if you need quotpersonalquot help it will again cost dkk you cant buy tickets somewhere your chat is closed your office is closed and we cant expect an answer because you are very busy yeah i read so many bad comments about you guys here and i thought to myself it cant be that bad but it is im now sitting here with a ruined vacation with kids who are looking forward to going on a cruise and im having such a hard time telling them its not going to happen it is incredibly unprofessional and insanely irresponsible that you do not have some quick and effective solutions for us who are waiting for some help i choose here and now never to travel with you nor will i recommend your bad service if it can be called service regards ivana
dfds is an example of ignorance if you dont want to accept foot passengers on the calaisdover route which i dont understand at all you cant do anything with it moreover i have not received an answer from dfds via email then you try a different route dieppenewhaven the outward journey went well despite little enthusiasm on the boat trip in addition there are few or no electrical outlets and you get little or no wifi reception on the return journey from newhaven to dieppe we were told that we would be a little late well that takes an awfully long time up to more than an hour then we are waiting for a bus without being able to drive any further so im going to ask to get part of my trip back this is really ridiculous
contacted dfds by telephone to amend booking to include a cabin position in q operator answered and dealt with my request efficiently and promptly total call time min
due to travel next saturday th april after the debacle at dover and m last weekend we decided it would be better to travel from newhaven to dieppe spent hours on the telephone today have not yet spoken with a human have been at position no for over an hour considering previous answers from dfds that they have employed more staff to help i think they all must have forgotten to set their alarms to wake up on monday service industry bahh we care bahh your call is important to us bahh i have now booked myself on the newhavendieppe route and paid again anticipate they will refuse any level of refund for the fact they could not be bothered to deal with customer requirements just hope that my return from calaisdover will still remain in place have advised them by email but no doubt it will be ignored and i will find myself stranded with children at the ferry port ho hum richard
i have travelled with dfds for years and it was normally a very pleasant experiance but not anymore having noticed a mistake on my booking form because it defaulted back to one passenger i tried to contact them to correct the details i phoned at exactly the time the phone line was open and was th in the queue minutes later i was th and gave up unlike eurotunnel you cant add passengers online after you have booked i ended up contacing the office of the md all very stressful
my booking was at and still here in dover at such a delay shame on dfds im here with my wife kids and pet cancelled the hotel in germany who gonna pay this
travelling from vancouveramsterdam schipol then on totake ferry with my dog to newcastle can you answer time it takes to clear dog and customs fees looking forward to our journey
i have been on the oslo cruise several times when i was younger my mother has always been in charge of booking there now i have to do it myself and have questions that you dont find under quotfrequently asked questionsquot but can you get hold of customer service no its very frustrating and im considering dropping the trip
we were booked on ferry on tuesday th march cleared passport and customs checks with an hour to spare and then were stuck in a single stationary queue waiting to be checked in minutes later people started wondering towards the cabin to find out what was going on only to be told that their systems were broken it is now and were put on a ferry to dunkirk as the only option no communication no explanations shame on dfds for such a tragically inadequate treatment of their clients two hours late and changed destination
disappointing experience we were going on a skiing holiday in norway and had been looking forward to a nice ferry ride with the family considering the price you pay it may actually be better to drive km in less than half the time we sailed with pearl and there are quite a few activities which by the way also cost money a somewhat boring and small playground for the very smallest children no common areas where you could sit and have fun with games books or your own food the only places where you could sit were in a caferestaurant where you had to buy alternatively people were crammed together in a small cabin the only good thing was the young woman who entertained the children with balloons and a treasure hunt there was no information about the program we intercepted it via the other guestsyou have to pay for wifi a bit like back in years ago and the purchase only applies to one device if you log into their network by mistake it costs a few hundred kroner a few minutes on the way back we drove all the way through sweden and you couldnt change or rebook your trip online you had to call in and a fee of dkk would be charged the oslo ferry is now a thing of the past for us
miserable checkin logistics it says checkin at so you mistakenly think that if you show up there you have a good chance of getting on the ferry quickly there are intervals of minutes where nothing happens and the quotguidesquot stand men and stare without doing anything over an hour later youre still there waiting and are the last to board after waiting over hours is it good customer service is this how you are rewarded for arriving in good time after the instructions and people who arrive at the last second drive straight into queues next to them you must arrive minutes before departure we can find out otherwise it is not worth it fool
the first and last corona test on the way back the biggest disaster for several travel groups one person was tested in our group one person presumed positive no second test possible tested again in new casel this was negative back in germany another pcr test this was also negative the rest of the group had to board the bus at the back over the ramp our bus driver was constantly and very rudely asked by the loading staff to drive the bus onto the ferry even though our travel group was still being tested at the time instead of having arrived about hours earlier i then flew with the person who was presumed positive now the next bombshell since the cabin was booked in my name and my wife didnt have my passport she was lucky that she could share the cabin with someone else it was not possible to rebook my cabin
corona rapid test ripoff at the highest level we took a weekend trip to scotland on the return journey from newcastle to amsterdam several travellers coaches were registered for the rapid test the rapid test cost a totally unrealistic price then it started completely disorganised four people behind the test area one opened the rapid tests one opened the barrier tape for four travellers at a time one took the nasal swab and the last evaluated the test we travellers stood in the queue for hours how can it be that dfds knows how many people are coming for testing and then they only have one person who can test thats a ripoff and total harassment the ferry was therefore significantly delayed on departure while we travellers were standing in the endless queue the ferry pulled into the gangway so a shuttle bus had to bring us the travellers onto the ferry why couldnt they wait with the gangway everything was totally disorganised the ferry itself was very uncomfortable but also not very clean in times of corona disinfection is a must but that was not important here in the restaurant we sat at tables that had not been wiped down after the previous guests i will not travel with dfds again and i cannot recommend dfds either
thank you dfds for getting us home from calais last night after being left in the lurch by po ferries we were supposed to be on the po hours but were transferred to you for the hours sailing i had never sailed with you after always travelling with po but will always travel with you again the service was an excellent standard and made the journey with adults one year old and and a baby of one her birthday so easy we all had a super crossing and the food was very welcome having just driven from disneyland paris thanks again andrew and family
i used dfds for the first time this february and was extremely disappointed by the service provided on the way to amsterdam many of the facilities were closed despite being advertised so all we really did was pay for an extremely overpriced buffet we were woken up at am the next day and told that we would be arriving at am but didnt get into amsterdam until am meaning we had less time of holiday that day than originally promised our return ferry was cancelled and we were given no support whatsoever basically just being told that we could either wait an extra two days or cancel we chose to wait and then our subsequent ferry was cancelled as well which was frustrating as no one had even warned us of this possibility it was difficult getting in touch with dfds especially as you have to pay for the phone calls and at this point i felt as though the whole journey had been a disappointment so i just wanted a refund dfds have no support to us in terms of the extra days of our travels leaving us bankrupt and having to borrow money as well as needing to miss an extra days of work i saw a clause in their policy saying that if theres a delay in the arrival of their ferry which there was on the way there then there could be some compensation but when i asked about this they said the delay was due to weather so they couldnt give any money which is the first i had heard about it and i wondered why we hadnt been told that it was a weather issue when we were woken up in the morning as they surely wouldve known by then overall dfds just seems like a money making service that gives little support to their customers and blames things on weather so they dont have to provide any compensation
we checked in yesterday hour before our due ferry to be told it was cancelled and the next ferry was at no reasons given we were told we should have received an email which we received hour before the original departure when we were already checked in and in the port facilities so could not get out they shut the old ferry terminal but the new one is still being built so no restaurant facilities all it has are vending machines which apparently so we were told by a couple of dfds employees were only put there because the dfds employees had like their customers complained that they had nowhere to buy food or drinks its very poor because of the cancelled ferry we were given a voucher that gave us access to the premier lounge on the ferry they redeemed themselves as the lounge was particularly pleasant they gave us prosecco and it had hotcold drinks as well as snacks staff on the whole ferry were polite and pleasant and the ferry looked very newly refurbished but it could have been a much more pleasant experience if we had been told well in advance that our ferry was cancelled it is the first time we travel with dfds ill be thinking twice before booking again with them
it can go even more down with quality any service nearly gone foreign staff looks p not much smiling any more quite understandable when seeing how they are treated by their employers the entire ship is decaying and rotting everywhere added today especially annoying is how commodore class cars are treated last time they allocated us on part of the car deck where you could open just the on the drivers side allowing just an eel to get out anybody knows for what is this coomodore sign what you get at check in to put in your front window last review the two stars are only for the extremely friendly and polite non european staff unfortunately its the only acceptable means to go by car from northern germany to northern england i am doing this now regularly since years first the hamburgnewcastle route since it closed down the ijmuidennewcastle route always commodore deluxe amazing and annoying how the service quality went down over the years continously
travel hours to be told they wont let me in on board i was there in time for my crossing unfortunately i purchase the crossing with direct ferries big mistake other i was told to get my refund by direct ferries but direct ferries say dfds ferry left on time nothing to do with me not been on time and so they using each others not to give me a full refund wont be using dfds again ah also the woman working on their office were not friendly at all rude more like and no feelings whatsoever not a nice experiance and a pay big price for nothing thanks to eurotnel for helping from now on i be using euro tnel services
its simply bullshit that the ferry is overcrowded so you have to put up with the car getting dents when you sail across the cars kept so close that there was a whole row more than the yellow lines in the floor were intended for the result was that no one could get in and out of their cars and our car was dented by people getting in and out when you otherwise sell a good service it is stupid to destroy it in this way
i cancelled my booking with them and it clearly stated they would refund me less the charge of euros travelling to and from from if cancelled within hours before departure i have emailed them yet they have not even replied and have tried to call them several times having no luck to get through to them
im trying to book a trip via the site the outward journey is reasonable but a bit cumbersome with a caravan but yes there is no way i can book a return trip if you look at the stena line site it is simplicity itself please have the site adjusted by someone who knows about it
it is not possible to book a crossing from amsterdam to newcastle with a small camper van in july and august one contact says there is no space left for larger vehicles the other claims that it is incomprehensible but that the management has decided not to transport camper vans in july and august this year these statements were made in february and you cannot say that this is too late to book what a pity i will definitely avoid this company in the future
we were a larger group with the oslo boat here during the winter holidays and on the trip back to kbh i got a nasty surprise dfds had according to its own statement filled the ferry well so that you could quothelpquot the many who wanted to return to dk without having to drive through sweden the price for the extra income for dfds is then paid by us who have a nice and dent free almost new car an extra row of cars was wedged into the car deck which meant that i who was at the very end couldnt get out the drivers side door and had to crawl over the center console and passenger seat with a bad knee and big boots on to get out a car full of busy young people was placed blocks away from my car and only because i demanded it was allowed to drive forward so that it could be emptied only to be backed into the hole again i had to stand and hold the drivers door myself to make sure my front fender didnt get a dent there were approx cm between the cars nice photos available very stressful when i approached the ships management with my complaint about the conditions on the car deck it triggered a ticket for a cup of coffeecoke for the of us in my car then you have to assess for yourself whether it outweighs the risk my sailing tripentry to kbh ended before everyone elses as i had to be the first on the carriage deck to look after my car a good piece of advice for future travellers take the trip through sweden instead if you are happy with your car and dont want it to be dented and repainted when you get home its not worth the discomfort in the body and the bad experience on the car deck even if there is a cabin and delicious food along the way and certainly not if you yourself end up with a dented car that no one will take responsibility for to thomas from dfds thank you for your reply however it does not change the fact that dfds takes the profitable chance while the customers have the risk and the trouble afterwards when it has gone wrong it was entirely my own merit that nothing happened to my car your people on deck felt no responsibility for the situation
had an old booking from that was postponed again and again due to corona have now changed to a booking that almost matches the old one despite the fact that it is a different ferry and a different price the nice employee maria did her best and now we have a booking on a perfect trip and we are looking forward to finally being able to set off
unrefundable bookings even weeks before departure even though the website says they do refunds
booked way in advance to go to dieppe for our first family holiday in two years feb half term booked a cabin so we could get some rest before the big drive on the other side dfds sent an email a week before saying due to health reasons all cabins were cancelled customer service gave me two different excuses so on the friday evening of the start of the feb half term they decide to cancel all of the cabins that were booked so many families going skiing with their kids now wont have a decent sleep before their long drives to the slopes now thats what i call a health hazard this is the first and last time i will ever use this company
the one star is aimed at the french border officials cosily sat in their booth after driving for over hours with pet cats we were ordered to exit return to the uk by a pompous female borders official because my wife who is romanian has a different name than mine we have never in years of using dfds ferries experienced this this woman basically ordered me to prove your married to the madame before telling me to exit the port and in my opinion because were unvaccinated despite having certified certificates saying negative covid test we were not even staying in france but transiting to romania we have had no problems with dfds however but l dont hold out any refund hope on a standard ticket i hope your proud of yourself madame border official
worst service i was going to oslo on the th but i found out that i hadnt written my birthday so i tried to edit but i ended up canceling it i wrote an email saying that it wasnt on purpose and that i still wanted on that trip but they didnt answer and i called within customer service hours and i called times i try different phone numbers if its because i had a bad call but they didnt answer anything im very dissatisfied
dfds is constantly enticing with offers ex frederikshavn to oslo for dkk for members of the ldresagen the problem is that you cant get home from oslo unless you go via copenhagen and then it becomes an expensive affair tried contacting customer service but after queuing as for minutes i gave up what is happening to you guys
two cabins for half a trip we are a pair of siblings who have booked a return trip from copenhagen to oslo my sister has booked a cabin from copenhagen which sails around i find out that the ferry arrives in frederikshavn at around pm i call and ask if it is possible for me to hop on via gangway in frederikshavn as i live in midt jutland and it will save me a longer journey i get hold of an employee who explains to me that it is not possible as i then have to book a new cabin so they know which one i sleep in what the hell should i pay an more cabin for when i have one ahead where it is registered that i need to sleep the employee explains that there are two different routes and that is why return from oslo has the same departure schedule i call and ask if i can get off in frederikshavn at about pm the answer is again no and i have to buy a new cabin even if i dont have to stay on the ferry nothing short of talentless and completely extremely bad customer service never again dfds
we have used dfds amsterdam to newcastle for many years we have used dfds amsterdam to newcastle both ways for a number of years with no complaints but at this time we must complain about my return from amsterdam on the th january to newcastle find out on border control that all facilities are closed and we have to get our meal take away and eat in our tiny cabin when we depart we recieve announcement that no facilities would be open just after pm went to deck for our mealsupper which we prepaid per person and per person for breakfast spoke with lady at the front her name was karolina and she said that rules are changingupdating daily we have said that days before travel we were adding meals for and pay extra costs for dog and roof box and nobody informed us no email or text message either before journey there was not enough food to choose from my husband dont like sea food curry so he could only take pork with slice of potato wedge and cold vegies in general this food was not worth it to pay any moneyit wasnt tasty either very dissapointed service as loyal customer in past years travelling at least twice a year seen someone comment that no facilities were open end of december and one of the dfds staff has lied to us that rules are changing daily i am expecting a full refund otherwise we could preper ourselves better for sailing our pet friendly cabin wasnt very clean eithervery dissapointed regards joanna
our family is norwegian with small children and likes to use the ferry as a family and climatefriendly means of travel for the grandparents in norway but unfortunately its probably over after we had an involuntary detour of km on dec extra hours of transport a lost working day and no compensation not even for the hotel stay we could not use after coronas entry there is now only one operator on the frederikshavnoslo route and only a very few familyfriendly times to arrive and depart namely as there is no public transport at that time we had therefore booked a hotel stay at quotthe reefquot as part of the christmas holiday but a good min before the ferry was due to arrive in frederikshavn it was announced exclusively on the walkways and not in the cabins that the ferry would continue to kbh instead due to bad weather when we initially contacted information on board the ferry we were promised compensation as long as we kept all receipts but when receiving an email on january from customer service reference is made to quotforce majeurequot we were initially happy with the news that dfds took over the operation as we have always considered the company superior to competitors on the market but you cant trust that the ferry is at the quay where you bought a ticket for and you cant even get his expenses reimbursed in this connection we honestly no longer see the ferry as a real option a real shame because dfds could so easily have won our trust back for example they could offer us a new cruise as compensation something that has great value for us but is not a big expense for dfds disappointed greetings from the ingemannmolden family
we have used dfds newcastle to amsterdam for a number of years with no complaints but im afraid this time i must complain about my return for amsterdam on the dec we got on board and thought there was something wrong when not facilities were open when asked staff about this no one could give us any info we departed hour late they announced it was due to staffing problemswhen we eventually depart we recieve another announcement that no facilities would be open the evening meal wich we prepaid for will be a pack lunch to be eating in your cabin and to top it off you are strongly advised to remain in your cabin for the full journey to say im not best pleased is a understatement i am expecting a full refund regards mr blackwell
the french ruined our crossing and dfds put a further nail in the coffin with no refund youve certainly made sure that covid doesnt effect your terms and conditions havent you have a lovely christmas dfds clearly we wont to your reply dfds what use is a credit when you never what to travel with dfds again cheers
we were denied boarding in spite of having all the correct paperwork we then drove to the eurotunnel and were able to travel using the same paperwork they dont know the travel rules and the staff are too arrogant to check and seem to enjoy upsetting their customers and taking delight when a child starts crying as they cant go home we have received no refund or an apology
yesterday my wife and i ages and were treated to an unforgettable ordeal by dfds staff at port de calais when we arrived we were refused a boarding pass because my phone would not upload the passenger location form and eventually sent over to the dfds office who were unable or unwilling to help they sent us across to the gendarmerie who escorted us to the uk border force who are outside of the port fence the border force checked our passports and covid papers and passed us to enter the uk we completed the various port checks until we reached the boat but when our turn came we were refused access as we didnt have a boarding pass we came out of the port and reentered to go through the process again only to encounter the same problem with the first dfds kiosk attendant no passenger location form no boarding pass there was another escorted visit with the gendarmerie to the uk border force where one of the officers was able to get the offending form up onto my phone we returned to the first kiosk where we now received our boarding pass and proceeded through to the boat i now know that uk government instructions to border guards are not to look for passenger location forms if a computer phone in not working the data are all on government computers anyway what rankles most and what we will never forgive is the way the dfds staff simply abandoned us an elderly couple with not a second thought to find our own way around the port between the many huge lorries trundling through the port as all of them said this is what you wanted with your brexit our grateful thanks do go out to the several local gendarmerie and uk border force who were very polite kind helpful and ultimately successful in freeing us from what was looking like becoming a lengthy sojourn in calais port but eventually resulted in a lost hours that we will never recover
years ago are used to travel monthly with dfds and i loved everything about it now ten years later i took the trip newcastle netherlands and basically everything turned into a disappointment i know its due to government rules which are even more idiotic then disappointing but then they charged me pounds for a test which has absolutely no use except for money laundering and scam and was not well stated in front i hope i infected everyone on the ship although i will never catch covid because my health is perfect fine just dismiss all rules about covid and lets have fun again no worth protecting of the people who are going to die anyway i will create my own party at home because i certainly cant get one at dfds ship can i please get my pounds for the scamtest back
got an email on my return trip from oslo the other day saying that there would be no additions in frederikshavn it also said that they had tried to contact me it turned out that they had tried to call once days before i was due to leave and didnt send the email until days after so now i was in norway with the option of coming home a day later without help from dfds so consider whether it is a good idea to travel with dfds as they openly cancel docking in frederikshavn if there are not enough people on board
i have just returned home after days at sea and am full of good experiences but also with some surprises i am surprised for example that there is no baggage check when you check in in copenhagen i am also very surprised that there is such a big difference in accommodation we were women and had to live and together in rooms the rooms were large and beautiful with a nice bed while the last two rooms were small and the bed was quotonlyquot a last but not least the trip with the shuttle bus from the ferry to hovedbanegrden was not fun the driver chose that the bus should not just be filled up but completely filled up when we drew attention to this in these corona times the answer was it is only on monday that we have to take corona into account a bit of a practice experience after super days on board with lovely food and super staff
booked on may commodore class for grandma and i with departure october dkk i made the mistake of ordering breakfast which i learned after paying was included after contacting dfds i was refunded dkk very soon we were looking forward to the trip as an older married couple we were also overtaken by fear of corona in the autumn and therefore chose on to cancel our trip to norway on the trip was paid for with times seas evening buffet as soon as i had pressed the button of the price of the trip had evaporated however according to your terms what i dont understand is that payment for devouring was also cut in half it was canceled more than a month before we were due to leave and can hardly have had any financial significance for the restaurant if you maintain the cost for nothing customers should probably consider not preordering catering so far i have not received my receivable of dkk it must surely be an oversight sincerely niels mller postscript pr in december i received a refund of receivables totaling dkk thank you for that nothing more is outstanding i have therefore changed my assessment of dfds to a more positive impression very long long processing time
we had planned to travel home by ferry from oslo to copenhagen and had therefore booked a ticket home on the ferry we had spent a short week in sweden and in the meantime corona passports had been reintroduced and we were trying to understand exactly how it was enforced by dfds so we could make sure we had the right things ready unfortunately one of the travelers had needed to be investigated as to whether the person could tolerate the vaccine potential allergy to a binder therefore it was necessary to understand the more detailed requirements for the corona passport and what was accepted as a negative test should you have a paper an app or what specifically spoke this is not clear from the website thats why we called dfds on friday before departure on sunday unfortunately we couldnt get through but luckily there was a chat unfortunately the chat wasnt available so we could write an email we did not manage to get an answer per email and from the website which customer service keeps referring to it is not clear what exactly is accepted as documentation for a negative test because it was impossible to get an answer and we feared being stranded in oslo we were forced to cancel our ticket for nothing because it was too late but as a good citizen some others could get off we ended up driving all the way home from northern sweden and had to book an overnight stay on the way as a plaster on the wound dfds offered us a discount corresponding to approx of the extra expenses we had due to their poor customer service subsequently we have come into contact with their customer service per email and it turns out to be primarily a customer rejection function but it is so very much in line with our experience with dfds evil tongues will think that you should have extra preparedness ready by the phones and the chat when the corona pass is reintroduced so that customers can get answers to their inquiries about requirements for boarding
we have just booked two minicruises for us and my parentsinlaw and we can see that the money has been withdrawn for both trips however only the one trip shown on quotmy pagequot is booked and also only the one we have received booking confirmation for but the money of almost has been withdrawn for both trips there is always a problem with dfds nothing works now we dont know if it has been booked or not
we have used the newcastle to amsterdam service doing returns in the last months overall experience is not that great but is understandable under current covid conditions when comparing to normal service we returned amsterdam to newcastle on the th november on king seaway the service was as good as can be expected with helpful boarding staff we were in a commodore de luxe as usual and were pleased to learn the lounge was open again just a shame the coffee was cold and service very limited the cookies were good departure time arrivednothingmins passed still not departed hours arrived still not departed and absolutely no explanation i went to customer service and was told engine trouble but they were dismissive and rude i suggested as a basic control and command function the captain or his first officer should make a tannoy as passengers were getting upset it took hrs mins for the captain to make a very basic announcement as to why we had not departed this is unacceptable and extremely bad judgement of the captain even if he had no information an announcement explaining the vessel had technical issues and commitment he would keep us updated should have been his course of action it made me a little nervous around the ability of my captain he obviously lacked experience to understand how important it is to keep people updated when things dont go to plan nobody can do anything about technical issues these things happen however it is how the situation is managed that matters and this situation was handled very badly absolutely no concern for the welfare of passengers i would certainly think hard about using this service again after this experience po may benefit from this captains lack of care and attention for his passengers
it is simply not right to let the price rise by several thousand kroner and then lower it again hours later we sat at the weekend and looked at copenhagen oslo and back again a week later in connection with our skiing holiday monday morning the price has increased by dkk we hurried to book for fear that the prices would continue to rise and now days later the prices have fallen again thats pretty bad service
i won via biospil a trip with dfds back in february due to covid our voucher moved in relation to when you had to book which in its sense has been fine last date for booking was on i get a trip booked for the end of november where i have screenshots left containing a booking number and the email and received the booking confirmation per mail now the time is approaching until we have to leave and because so much time has passed my email has disappeared in my inbox but i still have screenshots of the email itself and the booking number i am therefore contacting dfds to make sure everything is fine it is not my voucher has been used but they cannot find my booking in the system either by my name or booking number the quotnicequot gentleman in customer service then tells me that i can go in and book a new trip by paying myself i have everything ready i have informed about the date and name etc why do i suddenly have to myself pay cant the man in service just have created a new booking normally when you need something its enough to have your booking number but now im glad i didnt step up and think i was only going to go with the booking number only to be turned away because they dont have control over yours in addition the response times are extremely slow one thing is that they take a long time before starting the conversation but between each response i get days pass its simply too bad i dont immediately want a trip with dfds and would encourage everyone to contact them and ask if everything is fine before you think you are going to leave in case you are turned away at the quotdoorquot before departure
booked a return trip via dfds website on the booking confirmation our return trip is we got to the port at and lo and behold there is no ferry its at which we missed due to all the formalities stuck in the port for more hours not a single apology from dfds staff from now on ill pay the extra and book the tunnel would rate dfds below star if possible had to make arrangements for our kids so that wed be able to pick them up later absolutely disgraceful save the put a bit more on top and take the train at this point i believe im due either a refund for the return trip or compensation for being transferred to a later ferry
i have booked a trip with breakfast later i choose to go to their website and also book a table at explorer steakhouse on the way out and seas on the way home i think it all goes through i can see on my bank that the money is being withdrawn but the bookings do not appear on my ticket so i contact customer service on september and explain the problem on october customer service replied that they can see my bookings have not gone through so they have deposited my money as a voucher that i can use on board d october i answer that i am not interested i would like to keep my bookings as we have to have food on october dfds replied that they have booked a table for us at seas on the return trip but the explorer steakhouse is unfortunately no longer available on october i reply that it is not in order because we also have to have food on the trip on november dfds replied that they had booked a table at explorer steakhouse at pm we are a family of adults and children aged and first of all its not in order that it takes so long before they respond to customer service its f not service there would probably have been a table if they had responded much sooner secondly pm is far too late for a family with small children now our trip is ruined before we even get off how much fun is it to travel with hungry children and eat at a restaurant when they are tired
i had an issue with my booking due to the way in which crossings were displayed even though i had selected a particular destination an email was responded to quickly and a change was made without a fee many thanks for this have used dfds many times over the years and will continue to do so
my low sports car was not accommodated well on my recent trip from dover to calais despite you acknowledging special boarding at the time of booking checking in my car was squashed into a space so small i couldnt get my door open nor could the car next to me get in or out without hitting my car this was so different to the very helpful assistance afforded to me on my outward trip from calais please explain why the needed assistance from you is so different
hello i have received an offer for minicruise to give dkk which i saw for the back on my key card but can see that you have to check in at in copenhagen and then sails at how many hours do we have when we get to oslo sincerely lone wolf
warning if you receive a gift certificate from dfds you must according to book the gift certificate via dfdsdkshop but if you book a trip on the same date same cabin via dfdsdk there is a big price difference in my case there was a dkk difference false advertisement i wrote a complaint email over days ago without hearing anything from quotthomasquot does anyone else know of an email address where you can complain about dfds customer service

in connection with our trip to norway we have tried to change our trip without your help and have been forced to cancel our trip for which we have not received the money back and after trying again to get an email correspondence started there is no answers or help to get we still need answers and to get our money back from our trip
great experience this weekend i had the pleasure of being on a minicruise with pearl seaways from copenhagen to oslo with my children the whole trip was a great experience for all of us and the service was top notch all the way around it was a super trip that can be highly recommended many thanks to dfds and the employees on the ship
i have contacted dfds customer service to change a booking a week ago i sent an email with no result i have called several times a day waited up to an hour with no result it is incomprehensible that such a large company has such poor customer service i am deeply shocked
dieppe newhaven no issues with staff friendly or boat but a concern when we returned to the cardeck we had been one of the first on our camper was located at the front of deck but the stairway closest had no clear walkway to get back to the camper as the lorries had been loaded behind it after several attempts to find a safe way to get to the car and with no staff available to ask how we could safely return to our vehicle we had no choice but to walk squeeze between the lorries some of which were already starting their engines frankly it felt very unsafe and was terrifying
we have placed an order for cars and people round trip until march we would very much like to have confirmed changes to the order and confirmed that we have the order via deposit for example but it is completely impossible to get in touch via phone or email is dfds still alive yes they do got through after a good hour however had to maintain the submitted offer price as quotthe price had increasedquot ok service from customer center
newhaven dieppe crossing booked a cabin as it was a night crossing charged for a cabin that was really cold only a sheet on the bed not even a quilt for any warmth no shower curtain hence bathroom gets totally flooded with water very poor for the price
i was on a trip to oslo on october and had booked commodore cabin and dinner at explorers steakhouse on the way home however i canceled explorers steakhouse before the trip and got a new receipt where it showed that i would get the dkk back but i have not received the money back and dfds has withdrawn the money when i booked the journey i have emailed dfds about this th october and have still heard nothing and still havent got my money back and im starting to doubt very much that ill get it its bad service and also a bit of a scam because now ive unnecessarily spent dkk on food at various other places on the boat while at the same time ive paid dkk for a dinner on explorer which i canceled otherwise it was a nice trip i just want to add
i have been traveling regularly from amsterdam to new castle for years my experience has shown that other ferry companies are much better equipped and organized despite this we always choose dfds because the connection suits us best what happened to us in new castle before our return journey this time was the last straw it was our mistake not to know that you need a test to enter holland despite being vaccinated dfds informed us albeit only in the small print but then to charge for a rapid test on site is pure ripoff we had a valid pcr test with results by email but it was not recognized even though it was ordered by the british government days after entry and is recognized i think they should have been explicitly informed in advance they let customers walk into an open knife there i am not sure whether dfds is responsible for this if not i take back the accusations i then ask for information about who organizes this ripoff so that i can place the review where it belongs independent it is directly linked to travel data where else do they get our credit card information from they support this exploit everyone knows that these tests can be carried out much more cheaply they play on the need and dependency of customers
maybe you need to write here here it seems someone gets contact and answers i have written an email on before departure on but have not received a reply yet telephone contact with this company is completely impossible
i have now written to them times as they have charged too much i get no answer but my sister and niece who were also on the trip and have asked about other things not anything involving money back got an answer after about minutes i think they are sorting through the email inquiries and they are avoiding the ones where a refund has to be made it is very unprofessional and not very trustinspiring for a large company our trip was nice though but this just makes you not want to use them again
like several others in this thread we have had to give up getting in touch with dfds customer service we received an offer through the dfds newsletter but when we tried to book the journey we couldnt get to the actual confirmation after choosing the date entering the discount code and selecting the cabin i tried to call customer service and sat in line for over minutes without being told if i moved up in line there was only muzak two emails in the last days have not been answered and further calls gave the same result as the first the problems with getting in touch with dfds customer service have obviously existed for a long time cf the other reviews on this page shouldnt a serious company have done something about it by now
we have also waited for hours and written emails we need to change the return date and it is urgent it is extremely frustrating and i have never experienced anything like it on our many trips with dfds su thomas moller
no service at all have been waiting in the phone queue for a very long time and written emails with no answer no trip with dfds from here
i have tried for two days to get in touch with dfds on the phone and by email where i get a standard email that they are busy and will contact me as soon as possible no one answers in danish on their customer service number
hi thomas it looks as if you are the only man on the redoubt i have written called and called and i can see from the history that it is completely crazy i want to move my return trip and that requires me to get in touch with you what should i do when you dont answer
i returned from france today having attempted to board twice on a dieppe newhaven ferry and both times been refused due to complete incompetence of the staff and confusing information the staff are poorly trained ill equipped to check in passengers and give differing advice about availability of wifi in the terminal some say there isnt any ability to print a passenger locator form the manager printed one but others refused and in our case taking minutes to amend a booking to add bikes when proof was shown of the amendment three days prior as a result of this incompetence and lack of any customer service despite there being few passengers there all with similar problems to do with passenger locator forms people were crying in the terminal as they attempted to complete the paperwork and there was no help compassion or instruction it was left to other passengers to help elderly confused passengers who had medical appointments to return to i for one had to miss helping my mother go into a nursing and respite home this morning because of their treatment met with rudeness by the french checkin who complained that the booking had been made with direct ferries as if that was our fault surely dfds has a relationship with agents that should be as smoothrunning as a direct booking not knowing how to do the amendment and after numerous calls over the tannoy we missed the ferry and were booked on a am ferry instead meaning a further hotel and evening meal cost and a am check in time our first ferry tickets booked on the sunday at last minute to get home earlier were refused because the french lateral flow certifcate was just waved away by the duty manager who was so rude when i asked for her name that she shouted at me in front of other passengers hours later the need for the certificate would be null and void but she had decided that we were not to board despite also bringing evidence of the negative test bullying unhelpful badly trained confusing poor english although i dealt with the staff in french it was shocking in the st century dfds need to clean up their act there were around a dozen people we met on the am ferry who had received similar rough treatment and i plan never to use the ferry service again i will be writing privately to dfds with the names of the staff who oversaw this cruel behaviour towards passengers
embarrassing impossible to get through to your customer service i hope you have better control of things and not least the crew on board your ship probably spent hours on the phone i wonder if you will be compensated if you one day get through to their customer service unlikely
impossible to get in touch with i spent over hours yesterday getting through your phone today when you open at i call at and am already in line completely impossible to book a trip with you by phone
no absolutely no possibility of contacting dfds customer service i have sat in a queue for over hour on occasions first on the dk telephone queue and then following instructions from the friendly telephone operator during the waiting period on the english telephone queue without ever getting through to you its honestly not good style in fact incredibly bad style in fact i just wanted to book a return trip from frederikshavnolso online but since you are also unable to provide specific information about the departure time to be able to come to oslo on i have to contact you in order to get clarification on what is possible could we just get through to you on chat but that is also closed im sorry to say it but it seems completely hopeless to get in touch with you guys
thanks for the answer and help but thomas the money has been withdrawn and not refunded as of please contact me extra star for doing something about the matter hello dfds it is clear that you lack the staff to respond to inquiries but that does not change the fact that your customer service is quietly destroying your business and you are getting such a bad reputation that no one will travel with you anymore here is my sad story with my first and perhaps last booking with you booking mini cruise to oslo email to customer service covid clarification call to customer service thrown away call to customer service dismissed email in english to customer service stating that we would like to move not cancel finally have to cancel the trip we cancel because the closer we get to the trip the less we get refunded even if we just want to move the departure on the dfds website information is provided about a quottravel guaranteequot which states quotthis means that when you book your journey with us you can make use of free rebooking you just have to contact us no later than hours before departurequot but it makes no sense when you cant get in touch we dare not rebook a trip even though we would like to go in october and it is a loselose for both partners it must be possible to do better good luck we are anxiously awaiting how much of our kroner we have to write off when the amount is deducted from our credit card tomorrow you get stars only because others in our network have told about good experiences with you
where to start i bought a mini cruise trip copenhagen to oslo as a birthday gift for my partner buying it was easy i specifically booked a personers commodore balcony kahyt because of the modern cruise ship cabin with a huge bay window allowing uninterrupted views what a mistake this turned out to be i afterwards discovered that the photos used on dfds own website are flash marketing actually not from pearl seaways but from crown seaways so instead of the specially selected cabin we got a small darker old looking cabin with nothing near a bay window so off to a bad start due to corvid vaccination fresh hold we were forced to change our booking from july to september this went smooth i called up at am on the dot my call was picked up within or minutes and a friendly man changed it for me which i was very happy with this was not the case as we got closer to our departure i needed to double check a few things i didnt find clear info about on the dfds website and i had questions regarding expectations from dfds to none danish passengers to avoid being turned away when boarding and losing the money i called times each time at am on the dot within the last weeks prior departure first time i was waiting in line waited min before a recorded voice told me there were too many callers and simply kicked me out of the waiting line with the message to try again later say what nd and rd time i called i waited and min without ever getting through the waiting line this is totally unacceptable i know we had corvid bla bla bla but also that this means many good yet unfortunate people lost their jobs in the service industry and that dfds should have hired them to help out it was again a huge downer having to worry til the moment we walked on board if we had understood and for filled all expectations of dfds no pre joy just stress and worries check in went normal the ship that apparently holds up to passengers only has on board so at least plenary of space cabin as said had nothing in common with the one advertised smaller older and darker i would definitely not have booked this nd most expensive canine if i knew that if you fit some reason want to book the personers commodore balcony kahyt i recommend you to try and get either or as they have an extra bullseye letting in a bit extra light and allowing views into the sail direction the commodore class lounge so so it looks old and tiered must be very crowded when fully booked and a nightmare if there were kids running around a ok selection of drinks red and white wine beers juice tea coffee of all sorts and hot chocolate the lounge foodsnack not impressed a few glasses with crisps a few glasses with gazpacho fruit and type of nasty cheap mini cupcakes with some dried cream on top this did not change as offerings during the hours we were on board there was in addition a deckterraced area where smoking was allowed problem was nobody bothered to empty the ashtrays come on guys we pay enough up your game we discovered wifi problems as soon as we arrived i went down to the service desk where i was made to feel like an total idiot by the guy working there he told me that surely it was my mistake and that there was never any issues with the wifi just as he finished humiliating me a lady came running over very upset it was th time within hour she was complaining about wifi issues it turned out she was a few cabins from us and it was not me being an idiot as the service assistant tried to tell me a kind lady took over arranged a nice technician fixed at issue things happen but unacceptable that the service assistant make us look like the problem first evening we had booked and paid for the buffet i had already tried to secure a table at the window by contacting dfds customer service they told me they could not help what i had to contact service desk onboard which i did only to be told that no they could not help i had to wait til the restaurant opened and ask there which i did only to be told they could not help me because they did not have the evenings seatplan are you kidding me is that customer service doesnt anybody know what is going on really nicely done buffet with loads of choice even though we were so few passengers impressed the few passenger were most welcome as we had to go through passport control in oslo took only min but if we had been passengers there would not have been much of the hours left to explore the city the captain made an odd announcement regarding weather instead of making it clear that there was a storm ahead and that we better go eat now and grab some seasick pills at the service desk so dont pre pay any meals waste of money so so could be better for dkk
cant get through to dfds by phone simply too poor service there is room for huge improvements have now tried several days in a row there must be some management responsible who must deal with this problem do you have to wait for hours to get through and talk to an employee etc unsatisfied customer is there a deadline for when this personnel problem is solved and not least is implemented there must also be strained working conditions for the other staff to be in
here we are sitting at home today and should have traveled with this fraudulent company we didnt leave because they dont answer emails and dont pick up the phone in customer service we have sent many emails spent about hours calling customer service never got through they have replied once to emails that they would fix it but it was just empty words it has cost us dk hours waiting on the phone and taken x week holidays which we can then use at home instead i would like to warn you all out there dont book a mini cruise buy a gift card or buy anything this is scam syndicate they dont respond and your money is wasted
i travelled with dfds a few years ago on a mini cruise and enjoyed the experience decided to use them again last year but due to covid and travel restrictions i had to cancel they were so brilliant and provided me a credit note which i then used to travel this year but again i was unable to travel and once again dfds offered a credit note to use by end of sept i have had multiple holidays cancelled due to covid and no other provider has been as easy as dealing with dfds they were so quick efficient and helpful customer service was outstanding and made what could be a stressful and disappointing experience very easy to deal with i cannot rate them high enough and will continue to use this company
why cant i contact you we were contacted by you on with information that you did not sail on the day we had a reservation and asked if we wanted to move the reservation or have the trip refunded we wanted to get the amount refunded and received an email on where you asked for our account no we replied to this email with account information on and asked you to confirm the full amount after that we heard nothing we therefore sent a reminder email on to david who had the case as well as a copy to dfdsinfo and dfdsdk unfortunately no answer either then we have called and called and called and hanged on hold for hours but still no luck what is happening and how should you behave as a customer
impossible to get through to via customer service how will it be possible to use your travel credit when you dont answer the phone and it takes weeks to answer emails its also quite annoying that you dont know what number you are in the queue so you can sense if the queue is moving at all not to mention the music
hanged in the phone queue for an hour without getting in touch the chat function has been disabled on the dfds website when you write a simple email you get an autoreply about the expected long response time its awfully small i think i will choose another sailing route to norway with a competing ferry company for example colorline from hirtshals
i have received a vaucher for a trip with dfds and unfortunately needed to make a reservation for a trip between copenhagen and oslo over phone first call took min to get through and a very helpful agent spend ish minutes doing the booking with me and redeeming my gift card as the gift card cost was less than the trip price i was promised to receive an email right away with a link so i can pay the difference in price and finish the booking i was given a booking number nevertheless i havent received any email and cant see my booking in my profile on the website i tied to get back in touch over phone with customer service and was prepared to paitently wait for another min as i can understand busy times i have a myself worked in customer support however i have been on hold for hour and min the second time and the call just hang at hmin where i stopped hearning any signal now im on my third attempt min in which totals to more than h holding time for one day to simply make a purchase of a trip this is a complete disaster and one of the most unprofessional experiences i had for quite a long time how could a paid service has such bad quality i wouldnt do this again however as the rest of my trip in norway is already planned and dependent on this travel with dfds im forced to go through this hurdle
awful experience extremely rude staff made check in a nightmare no reason no one else boarding all paperwork correctreally poor in general wont use again
we have been using dfds for crossings between dover and calaisdunkirk fairly regularly for years an havent had a single negative experience the ferries have always been without a fail on time the meals even the vegetarian ones are good and the customer service on land as well as on board is just outstanding whenever we had issues with the booking mostly selfinflicted we received quick help without a fuss by friendly staff members in the call centre checkin and getting on board is usually quick and easy everyone on board is absolutely lovely and goes out of their way to assist the customers we are very impressed and will always look forward to a ferry crossing with dfds i wish every company had similar standards
whilst this company was norfolkline i enjoyed the trips recommended their use especially dover dunkirk i am not going to say never again as you will see later but dfds have a understanding of the words customer services similar to mr olearys punishing clients never goes well the only saving grace was the free and good meal i have bought season tickets paid in advance been denied their use because their was no more space at that rate on that ferry for a ferry that left with no more than cars on board the season tickets were not valid for months from purchase or first use no only till year end i have turned up hrs late in the past the surcharge is a reasonable or fee but i was charged the difference to a ticket bought on the day for a ferry that left with cars on it i was told on each occasion by customer services to read the small print on the last occasion as a source of conciliation maybe the lady at the desk said that i was not the only one that afternoon i am not alone my patience has been broken i stopped using po after my experiences with the herald of free enterprise for personal reasons i will now go back
i have been trying to plan a trip to france via newhavendieppe with dfds the departure time is clear enough but there is no way to find what is the time of arrival in france or uk for the return how can anybody decide to sail with dfds if your arrival is a mystery i emailed dfds to enquire and all they sent me was checkin and sailings
update after contacting your office in the terminal i got help to refund the amount after that the answer came here on trustpilot thank you for the nice and good service in the terminal when you are now under maximum pressure in customer service like several others cant get through to your customer service have bought and canceled a trip within a short time when we changed our mind about the time of travel but havent been able to get through or get an answer for the last week after several hours of music on hold the money has been withdrawn but never returned not that terribly impressed but am willing to change this rating if you can answer when you get your money back on the thread here
i recently went on a minicruise to oslo it was a really good trip the only thing that drags it down is their rule about whether you want to stay on board or go ashore where you have to notify if you want to stay on board when i used to sail with viking line and silja line minicruise guests could decide for themselves whether they wanted to stay on board or not
excellent customer service once you get through but be careful if you travel with a dog between norway and denmark when booking they forgot to mention that there is a significant difference in the conditions for the dog on board the two ships crown and pearl at pearl its something close to optimal conditions for pets here you can take the dog out on the deck at any time so that it has to relieve itself or simply to get some air on crown on the other hand the dog is tied to the cabin and can only come out three times during the voyage accompanied by a member of the crew in addition it must take place at times determined by dfds and the airing takes place among winches anchor ropes and other ships equipment at the back of the ship its pretty much like walking the dog in a machine shop and when i cautiously asked in the information if we could speed up the airing by an hour because we had driven a long way to get to the ferry i had a very boring experience the quotservice personquot expressed that i could not expect to change the time of airing as it was a service they were doing me and the dog and not part of the crews actual duties however she agreed to try to change the time i later received confirmation that the dog could be aired an hour earlier but no one showed up at the appointed time the escort didnt come until an hour later anyway at the time dfds had originally set fortunately the dog was bombed after a long journey so it went well i must add that the crew that escorted us out were friendly and nice
it is really problematic that you cannot get in touch with dfds after countless attempts at telephone contact to change a booking this is not possible to do on the website we finally got through after several hours of waiting on the phone and were able to change the tickets but then it turns out that all the names are spelled wrong on the ticket have sent several emails in an attempt to get the names spelled correctly as dfds specifies that this is a requirement to be able to travel but no response and the tickets are still issued to some other names and it is impossible to get in touch with customer service
after more than years after paying the full price of the trip early bird discount it was finally possible to get the trip refunded by threatening to sue covered by the legal protection insurer a euro quotservice feequot was deducted this is of course not in line with the legal regulations but it shows how dfds rips off its customers by all means the fact that dfds was unable to carry out the trip due to corona is the risk of the dfds business model and not the customer the customer is therefore entitled to a refund of the trip price within a few days he does not have to accept a voucher deductions due to any expenses incurred by the company are not permitted the lawyers at dfds know all of this very well that is why it is all the worse that customers are treated like this dfds is counting on many customers not being able to defend themselves or assert themselves this is how they collect a lot of money in an unfair way this is also related to the lack of accessibility and the failure to respond to emails i strongly advise against booking the reviews speak volumes
very bad and misleading website would like to order your offer from frederikshavn to oslo the website shows the cheapest price but you cannot search for this price only on dates then you can start with dates and surprise surprise it is much more expensive it cannot be true that the cheap price may only apply to a departure in months
bad service we got a mini cruise as a wedding anniversary present then we bought a cabin with a sea view then our turn will be moving many times due to covid now we have a new date but now you have far our cabin with a sea view on our booking its not ok now i have to wait days for a reply by email have sent emails plus i have tried to call times and wait over minutes each time without getting through times i get kicked out i think its really bad service
no customer service whatsoever unable to get in touch with dfds i have now had a voucher since augustseptember every time i order a new ticket it is not deducted from my voucher no it is deducted from my bank account then dfds can sit with my money in their account for a year this is so simple from such a large shipping company and i am certainly not the only one who is dissatisfied and complainsmostly everyone does is it really legal to continue withdrawing money from ones account as long as one has money to his credit
first time with this company and not impressed at all ferry was at am we filled all our forms in like we were told to on the government website and went to the checkin desk we need to go back for urgent medical reason which meant we were exempt from the day and test however the gentlemen told us that it wasnt a real reason and we needed to go to the office the lady in the office was very racist towards me and my partner very unhelpful and has terrible costumer service skills altogether the lady spoke to my gp who told her the reason we needed to go back straight away and she still refused us entry it took till pm and later to finally board a ship that ended up leaving late i do not recommend this company because it didnt just happen to us it happened to numerous people at the same time
when you call an hour before closing time you cant get through and end up being kicked out back in august we should have been with dfds this was canceled due to corona we received a proof of credit on which could be used until august but have not had the opportunity to leave at the price we were booking for at that point we therefore asked back in march to get our money refunded and was told it would be up to about days but we have not seen the shadow of the money so really bad contact with customer service and would not recommend to others
were denied boarding on rd of august for the amsterdam newcastle ferry the lady on the check in desk and her manager were not aware of the current transiting through uk landslide requirements and both were insisting for a prebooked test for day and day even if thats not required for transiting customers they didnt even properly look at the passenger location forms where the correct exempt reason was selected for that particular section duty manager was very arrogant and intentionally was ignoring and refusing to listen and pay attention to our argumentsevidences that isle of man is not a part of uk we are not uk residents we are transiting through uk and there is no requirement to quarantine on arrival or take a covid test on or before day and day at some point i think she realized that our argumentsevidences were totally relevant but it was too late as the ferry had already gone so she agreed to refund us and recommended an alternative route rotterdamhull via po ferries during the process of arranging the refund and printing a refund confirmation her colleague was laughing and mocking at my eldest son upset behavior which was very unacceptable for a professional who is a part of one of the leading shipping companies we then had to quickly arrange a new booking via po ferries for rotterdamhull route and drive fast to the rotterdam port ensuring will be on time for the checkin as expected we didnt have any checkin issues at the rotterdam port the lady on the checkin desk had properly read the completed passenger location forms and especially the quarantineself isolation and requirements to book a covid test package in uk sections for when you arrive in uk where we clearly stated in the forms transiting landside in uk and departing through england england only as exemption reason checked our negative covid tests and passports and issued the boarding passes i raised an official complaint and compensation claim on but as i expected a standard response in cases like that was provided without case details evidence and staff behavior being investigated and cctv and audio records being checked i and my family followed all the rules guidelines and requirements for transiting through uk landside and in my initial reply i also attached a link to the deal agreed on between uk and isle of man regarding this matter just a quick question to the dfds relevant department if theyre going to properly review this case not like their colleagues in amsterdam what about if we didnt have enough funds to book the ferry from rotterdam to hull on the same day did we have to stay on the port with two kids in the car for days and book it once we got the refund this is just not customer care and friendly service i asked on my latest email from to the amsterdam team for someone to provide me an email address to the dfds head office claimscomplaint department department where this case can be raised reviewed and investigated properly however there is still no reply
stop taking the oslo boat they never reply to emails and cannot be contacted by phone
the worst customer service need to talk to them about departure bought for tomorrow but cant call them and they havent replied to email despite emails sent
never buy a gift certificate from dfds bad times to travel and no response from customer service
arrived for our calaisdover ferry ok a thats late missed not just but as well reason queues to po and dfds were barely moving but it was neither the french passport control or border force booths at fault dfds had only two out of seven booths open in august cars cutting into the queue from the side as they were desparate you either let them or rammed them almost came to blows with a gobby family in a range rover also people impeding the queue and cutting back in on foot because they hadnt done the required paperwork probably hadnt booked a pcr test in advance then they came back down from their quarantine parking area on foot in and pushed in front without so much as a wave or apology root cause aside from country in asia that created covid and uk government making everyone pay for pcrs was dfds too cheap to pay enough staff to open up one or two of the spare booths made for a hour stressful hell with horns beeping and drivers threatening each other with violence only consolation is we didnt have to pay extra for the bumped crossing dfds maybe trying to prove a point that it shouldnt be their responsibility to check uk stasi docs and should be border force just a hire a few extra staff and charge an extra quid cone off the closed lanes so people cant cut in without busting through a line of cones shame on you dfds for your lazy incompetence one star becuase cant give zero and the free meal was nice except run out of butter after people
we have booked a trip from oslo to copenhagen as our end of our road trip around scandinavia unfortunately we just couldnt manage to get fully vaccinated before departure and therefore couldnt be allowed to enter norway without having to go into quarantine i therefore wanted to get our money back and i could do that but only half as the cancellation fee was however i cannot understand that as we have bought accommodation transport and catering and it is therefore a package tour where we are then entitled to a refund of the full amount it is now days since i wrote this to dfds and i have pressed for a response twice since but have heard nothing further from them and have not received a refund seems like they have cut back on their customer service to save money but it just results in their potential future guests being disappointed and unsatisfied
days before our departure copenhagen oslo i call dfds regarding questions about departure times i sit with the phone for quarters of an hour and then suddenly get quotthrown offquot on the same day aug i write an email to those who here aug still not answered today i try to call them again only to be told that they are very busy and to try later and then i am disconnected how the f you have to get in touch with that company
traveling calaisdover was alright but newcastleamsterdam is a disaster the price for a single bunk in a bunk cabin the cheapest is fantastically high gbp but the worst was that my motorcycle was stolen more than a week in advance and turns out that the ticket is not cancelable this is worse than most airlines i lost gbp for nothing be careful
excellent experience used to travel with the shuttle however decided to take the ferry this time for my trip to romania and was extremely pleased with my choice lovely food that was given free on the vouchers extremely polite and professional members of staff that proved very helpful for the entire journey i am now on the same ship enjoying cooked food vouchers with my family accompanied by yet again friendly staff this experience taught me we sometimes need to take it easy and enjoy a decent trip in return of a fast but cramped crossing much thanks
terrible staff and service the staff treated the guests terribly which made me and my family less likely to order anything just to avoid them the paid wifi was useless the car parking regulators were lazy and not focused due to their incompetence they made cars collide into each other which is surprising that the number is so low because the card were packed too tightly which made it impossible to get out and in the car we have sailed with dfds regina before which was fine but our experience on dfds athena is unacceptable and we are wondering what did we just spend our money on dfds seaways should consider doing something about it because we will not sail with them again
it is under all criticism what happens at dfds someone needs to be fired it cant be right that you have to wait hours on the phone and then you get kicked out it also takes over weeks to get a reply to an email its crazy you cannot book online if you want to make the smallest changes you have to call in to listen to your terrible melody it will be goodbye from my side of dfds i would rather drive through sweden than take your ferry
i have asked for a small refund for missing our planned boat we had to pay for a new ticket at the harbor but luckily the great customer service refunded the whole amount to us we are dfds very grateful for this
travelled with dogs dover to calais on july returned to car deck to find the temperature on the car deck and of our dogs very distressed in the car the outside temperature was only so car deck was well above normal temperature dfds say this is within defra guidelines so that is not a problem would never use again as their respect for animal safety is unacceptable
we sailed four people from frederikshavn to oslo in july pleasant night sailing and wonderful breakfast our daughter forgot her headset in the cabin we have tried to call and write emails to ask about forgotten cases but have not received a response from dfds its bad service you could at least tell if messages were received what do you do with forgotten cases in dfds
i called dfds after trying to cross the border to france three times and was turned down due to incorrect information as to covid related enforcement rules as well as my partner being british and not being allowed to enter we only wanted to transit as well i spoke to two people from dfds on three occasions but one lady was incredibly accommodating and so helpful she restored my faith in humanity after my family and i went through hell highly recommended company
its a disgrace that lateral flow tests at newcastle cost each for a family of we paid in addition to our ferry ticket of almost the testing company employee at newcastle said he was earning an hour so clearly either dfds or the testing company is raking in the cash at the expense of passengers i have no objection to being tested if holland requires it but the tests should be affordable lateral flow tests are usually free or cost a few pounds in shops for the price of the tests we could have flown to amsterdam as a family then on the ferry there is only a course meal at available children have to pay for the cinema wifi costs extra and drinks at the bar are expensive for two small bottled beers and two sprites we are trying to be environmental but this business model makes it cripplingly expensive feeling ripped off
i have used dfds quite a few times over recent years and its been pretty good i bought a fully flex ticket a few months back paying the higher price for a refund if it proved necessary well today i requested a refund after a long wait to get through very polite operator explained she was confirming refund but it might well take two months to process two months come on get real i said i thought that was an excessive amount of time she said it was the volume of refunds being requested this is nonsense of course its an ill disguised bit of cash flow management this is completely unacceptable my money should not be used and abused in this way ive already paid for a refund facilityservice in the significantly higher price i paid i closed the call by saying i was unhappy but got no movement basically its lump it really poor you cant treat customers like this and expect a good reputation
booked crossing for my plans had changed and have been charged cancellation fee of avoid them
rebooked my trip newcastle amsterdam following cancellation from i have a travel voucher for which covers the cost of my rebooked trip trying to contact their customer services to confirm my new booking and credit impossible even ringing at am on the dot im put onto endless wait on the phone as usual listening to awful piped music email contact no response i have been a dfds customer for years appalling
it is quite clear that they are under pressure due to corona inquiries so there is an incredibly long response time but on the other hand they are super flexible and efficient when they finally do respond and in plenty of time before departure thanks to thomas
never experienced such bad service completely impossible to get in touch with dfds tried for days waited and waited on the phone sent emails but no response not even a response when i use the reference number they sent me my mission is to pay off a travel loan now the waiting time and patience is running out and our holiday in norway is ruined we are very disappointed with dfdss treatment
we used dfds to travel from amsterdam to newcastle with our cat and booked a pet friendly cabin all in all a great experience customer service was incredibly friendly and helpful giving us all the information we needed to make our journey with our cat go smoothly they even called the day before our trip to make sure we had everything in place and all our paperwork completed the cabin was clean and cosy with a sea view which our cat really enjoyed no signs or smells that any other animals had been in there although the seas were quite choppy during our journey the staff had free seasickness medication available which really helped too the only downside was the prices for food onboard we wanted to eat in our cabin so we wouldnt have to leave our cat by himself in a new place so my partner went to buy some food to bring back down to the cabin she returned with a pizza that had cost but all in all a great experience we had a smooth and safe journey to the uk and we were able to avoid putting our cat in the hold of a plane which was our main goal thanks to everyone at dfds for the friendly and welcoming service
you have to look for a long time for worse customer service i was on an oslo cruise with my girlfriend at the beginning of july and we were told that you could easily come ashore with a quick test so after it was done and we would go ashore we are stopped by the border police who say that we cannot come ashore unless we are fully vaccinated we try to complain to dfds customer service but we get no response back i had never booked a cruise stay for dkk if i knew we couldnt land such bad style
after booking a minicruise to oslo i discovered i had entered a wrong date since it is not possible to change the date online i canceled the trip and made a new booking i then received a confirmation of the cancellation from which it appeared that i had to pay dkk in cancellation fees which in no way reflects an expense for dfds but of course i should have read the fine print in their terms and conditions what remains is that they are lightning fast when they have to withdraw the money from ones account while they obviously have difficulty getting their act together to refund the rest of the dkk i have paid for the cancelled perhaps the legislators should take a closer look at that
eight days ago i submitted a complaint to dfds about a quotluxury cruisequot to oslo despite calls for an answer i havent heard anything i wonder why they have a department called quotcustomer servicequot
scumbags total scumbags took of booking from me but when the government restricted travel they wouldnt change amend or refund a penny kept the lot they blamed direct ferries and direct ferries blamed dfds do not book with these guys they dont answer phones and their website is pathetic great at taking money though as a former regular customer i will never use these again
trying to get in touch with you via phone and email so far it hasnt been successful yet hope to hear from you soon so i can book my trip greetings a frustrated and potential customer
used for travelling from dover to calais and back for me my husband and my month girl initially our booking was for doverdunkirk at am but since we arrived at am they offered us to depart at to calais and we happily agreed the boat was praticale empty in total maybe people but most of them lorry drivers who kindly took all the sofas and left me and my month girl on a chair but thats not accountable to dfds on our way back the food option was limited since we follow the kosher diet was basically limited choices we ask and the girl managed to give us a full portion of fishchips we travelled on the th july at am from dunkirk to dover i cannot recall her name but she was so kindly that she deserves an award
we booked the pm ferry from newhaven to dieppe we paid for one way on board the boat is filthy the floor clearly hasnt been cleaned in a while they do everything they can to stop you from sleeping even though the crossing is h very bright lights everywhere only old hard uncomfortable chairs and cold aircon also there is no free drinking water available on board which i believe is illegal on top of that dfds does not send updates if documents required change the only good thing is the friendly staff if you have the choice id recommend going with po from dover to calais
we had an unfortunate experience on our return journey to frederikshavn and chose to drive home via sweden therefore i would like to make other possible dfds customers aware of cf covid regulations per that before departure from oslo you must seek out test centers in the city yourself the police up there informed us that in several places you have to book an appointment days in advance if you want an appointment in the quotcheapestquot places a test costs up to dkk without this test you cannot come on the ferry it can therefore turn into a costly affair
they are shit they just decided to change my departure time for no fuckyyng reason i made my plans time critical and they just change the departure time this is the last time i will travel with dfds and i will make sure to tell everybody do not work with them shame on you
set off for dover friday aft france isolation that evening therefore couldnt go rang dfds hoping to reschedule the ticket even though technically we could have gone and dfds didnt have they did credited until sept next yr fantastic service dfds under very difficult times thank you
you advertise all the time with cheap trips from dkk but when i book we have to pay dkk for the car and the cheapest cabin for two people costs over dkk how do you get close to your offer regardless it says dkk and the offer is not there i have traveled a lot with dfds since we live in oslo but now we unfortunately drive home as dkk each way has become too expensive compared to driving home shame as were happy to sail with dfds cozy we have several friends who drive now due to expensive car prices
excellent customer service by joni in dieppe i wrote and complained about the negative attitude of how customer service treated me at newhaven joni investigated my complaint together with the port manager he acknowledged that there had been a problem authorised a partial refund and gave me some discount on a future trip top marks and btw the ferry was good too
after waiting in phone queue for a couple of minutes trip cancelled and will get credit very helpful phone agent lets hope we can travel next year
last year i had my ski trip cancelled due to covid dfds was taking us to oslo so i got travel kredits towards this year trip i just logged onto dfds so as to use those travel kredits by creating a new booking and no where along the booking process did i see that the new booking would be offset against what i paid last year in actual fact i had to pay some more money to secure the booking i have tried to contact dfds by many methods via chat which appears to always be closed i have called dfds a few times but after each time of mins i gave up i have also written an email and yet still no response please dfds respond so i can sort out my kids ski trip
have booked a cruise and wish to use one of the parking spaces in question which can be purchased as an extra but it is so obviously impossible it is totally impossible to get through on the phone i have called days in a row and every day sat in a queue for over minutes no luck getting through it is probably something close to the worst service you can provide that you cannot get in touch with the person you have booked the trip through i have given up and for the last time i use you and i see im far from the only one with that problem so the empty words with us do quoteverythingquot to improve it yes they are as i said empty words
well i finally got through to dfds and although it took a little time i was able to get vouchers for future travel so a bit frustration but much better than yesterday which was holiday in france where the call centre is located previous had to cancel due to covid restrictions no option for refunds or transfer of tickets tried to call on one line tired times and there is brief message about the opening hours i was calling within those hours and each time the line just hung up found another number that one indicated a p min cost i though i was ok as i was on a wifi call luckily my data spend manager cut me off after being on hold for ages as i was being charged what a scam trying to get customer service and they charge you for the privilege clearly they dont care but this buyer will be more aware the next time
i was rejected at the oslo ferry because i did not have a negative corona test taken within hours it was dfds own rules not the norwegian or danish ones dfds had not sent a message about their special rules but i expected i had read it on the website that they have corona regulations is understandable but the way they rejected me without in any way standing by the responsibility they themselves should have taken to inform about their rules was reprehensible they would not compensate my ticket or just give me a new one for a later time instead they ignored me and wouldnt talk to me and let me go in the middle of the night with no alternative or place to stay the lack of information and help meant that my journey instead took three days and cost me several dkk in addition to the lost ferry ticket
do they ever answer the phone maybe im just cynical but does dfds deliberately not answer their customer service number so that they can rack up income from the p per minute which a call costs to that number ive now spent several pounds trying to get through to them and am a bit fed up with the lack of response emailing them while producing an immediate acknowledgement has so far elicited no response whatsoever dire
dear thomas mller at dfds thank you very much for your help with canceling and reversing our payment according to your free cancellation within hours we have traveled with you many times and it has always been a positive experience we are looking forward to another trip to norway when the orange and yellow area is completely under control see you again nete
got a gift card for a luxury cruise but cant get in touch with dfds your phone number which is on the gift certificate dgs and everywhere on their website doesnt exist its both annoying and unprofessional
cant recommend enough with a dog from new castle and all that trouble dfds has taken care of me not only that nadine from customer service via fb answered probably messages from me kris on the ferry is a fantastically sweet waiter they helped me with a cage and space for the dog fantastic experience also with covid fart
the price level for bringing a caravan has become so high that you would think dfds would prefer not to have campers as customers of course there is also more money in a bus with tourists
dfds would rather u sit in your car for hours for your ferry rather than put you on the next half empty ferry they wanted pounds for that luxury my travel plans got messed up due to covid centres all they see is an opportunity to cash in
many thanks to signe for knowledgeable constructive smiling pleasant and patient customer service over the phone rebooking of ferry journey july from frederikshavn gt oslo the telephone queue was a bit long and the waiting music unbearable it costs one star in the rating but the service and the solution were on the other hand stars so all in all it becomes five stars
the french border is the worst so rude and cocky i hate it there english people are so kind and understanding i cant fault them they didnt let anybody know nhs covid tests were not valid shame on the french boarder controls they took our passports n had us waiting for minutes before returning with our ferry ticket already paid and not offering a refund because they didnt let us on the ferry do they have no common sense to think wait i didnt let them go i should refund the ticket stupid blonde french girl with no common sense or manners next time check who you hire please
i have nothing but praise and appreciation for the wonderful help given by jessica and emanuele at the booking office in dieppe without their help and kindness i would never have been able to get the correct passenger location number they are a credit to dfds and the company should be proud of their superb professionalism full marks for dfds i will always use this company
having been on the oslo boat more than times now i can really confirm that the trip up to norway is a super experience there is always good service everywhere on the boat and many options for various entertainment food and drink super trip for both the family a friends boyfriends trip or something else you dont have to go on a skiing holiday in oslo to get an experience out of the actual sailing trip back and forth the prices can be argued to be on the high side but if you keep an eye on their newsletters there is a chance for good deals it must also be said that i who am usually anxious about sailing trips feel safe with dfds seaways as i really feel a sense of security in their dedication to safety on the boat i have experienced a major storm before which fortunately did not end in anything dramatic due to their checked and reassuring staff
i booked and paid for a return trip from amsterdam to newcastle in but then covid got in the way and we couldnt enter the uk unlike other ferry companies dfds didnt offer a refund of the ferry price eg calmac in scotland refunded the ferry price immediately without any problems so you could only rebook for a later date i did this and postponed my trip by exactly year dfds charged for this the ticket had already been paid for year in advance now it wasnt possible again in june because of covid and i had to rebook for september now dfds has charged an additional mind you for a ticket that had already been paid for with no possibility of a refund i call that a really bad ripoff of customers taking advantage of the corona situation
we were with dfds pearl seaways december again a really good trip and super good service in the buffet restaurant seas both in the evening and in the morning and got our good table very close to the buffet and by the wide corridor which we have plenty of room for the wheelchair and that we should not spend so much on food and then on the return trip my wheelchair broke there too i would like to say a thousand thanks for the dfds staff service help and i was able to borrow a wheelchair as the rest of the trip went super well and at falck came and got my electricity wheelchair off the ferry and i didnt have to think about it any more and i just had to lend your wheelchair to taxi we are looking forward to the next minicruise as soon as the buffet restaurant seas can open again and without having to wear a mask we miss going out sailing with dfds pearl seaways on august i was able to book our christmas trip on december and again i only had a really good experience and i even had to call twice so we forgot to get the name date of birth i got through very quickly both times only to minutes waiting time great praise for telephone customer service the one thing i dont like is that on the booking confirmation it says good access conditions and not disabled cabin sincerely poul and mette
now that we cannot make our trip to newcastle again we have decided to ask for our money back that went without any problems we are very happy with that and will make another crossing to england in the future with dfds which we have been doing for years see you next time berend and evelien
arrived at the ferry port full of concerns having been shielding for over a year now with my year old daughter and having a full blown anxiety about covid we are due across europe all the way in hungary on the th so there was no way around this trip daddy couldnt join us and whilst driving doesnt scare me the trip mid pandemic with a baby did give me something to worry about on arrival i was pleased that both at passport control and check in i was asked to present negative pcr tests declaration forms and documents before i was granted entry this gave me a peace of mind to start with the staff also secured a spot right next to the lift so i can easily maneuver with the pram when we arrived on board a kind uniformed man jason i believe approached us baring gifts for my daughter and to welcome us on board pretty sure we are the only girls amongst the lorry drivers although i was going to spend the trip outside to minimise contact we ended up staying at the restaurant given that there are only a handful of people and we are safely positioned meters from each other the complimentary meal was only a cherry on top thank you dfds for making me feel ever so slightly saferbetter then what i expected and blowing my expectations today baby emma and diana
three days before travelling i booked my crossing from dover to dunkirk using the dfds website or so i thought when i arrived at the port of dover there was a problem it seemed id booked it in the wrong direction ie from dunkirk to dover its a stupid mistake but very easy to do indeed when booking through their phoneline and their live chat in the past their operators have themselves made the same mistake once or twice you would think this would be a simple case of recognising my mistake and changing the direction of travel this would cost them absolutely nothing instead they decided i had to pay them an extra to make the amendment this they explained was the difference in price between what i had already paid days earlier and the sameday booking price i protested that i hadnt booked it the same day i had booked it days earlier it only had to be changed the same day because i had made a mistake but they wouldnt listen knowing i suppose that i had already had to pay out for a covid test etc and would not drive away they knew they had me over a barrel and i had to cough up afterwards i contacted their customer care and explained the case again and asked for a goodwill refund they refused this and only offered a measly tiny percentage discount on my next crossing which was neither here nor there i declined it in my opinion its not fair play to pocket a fellows fifty quid just because hes made an honest mistake in the booking process
travelling anywhere is complicated nowadays but nothing could be as difficult and disorganised as the dfds crossing today after preparing all the necessary documentation before leaving i arrived in calais at with a flexible ticket booked days previously after waiting in a queue for two hours nothing was happening no information given by staff members and no indication of what time i would be boarding seeing yet another ferry arriving i hoped this would be my chance of boarding only to be told by a very surly staff member that the ferry in question was only for goods not passengers it is now hours and i am still in calais my hopes of finding accommodation in dover are gone and my itinerary has gone up in smoke if the staff members had checked that everybody had the appropriate documentation before approaching the dock area these ridiculous hold ups could be avoided plus communication is a great way of helping people who have to face a longarduous journey i certainly would not recommend dfds as sitting in the car in freezing temperatures for hours is not my idea of a pleasant channel crossing
i have previously traveled with dfds on oslocruise dfds currently running a campaign where you can win an oslo cruise but every time i try to join i get this message you dont have permission to access on this serve and now i have searched on my pc tablet and phone but it gives the same result now i have spent hours on this and my patience has run out o vh jannik
hello i traveled with my wife from kiel to klaipeda on february th the twoperson cabin was fine i have been traveling with dfds at least once a year for six years why cant they set up german tv channels that shouldnt be a problem there are people walking around in all areas on board without masks
i have been using this company for a few years now over the last months i have had to cancel a number of trips due to covid i have asked for refunds these have been completed within a week i have asked for booking to moved this is done within hours and credit also within hours nothing is to much trouble the ferrys are comfortable the food on offer is of good quality and value i could see no reason why anyone would want to travel with anybody else
really good service unfortunately i have had my trip to norway with dfds in march canceled due to covid a situation on which neither dfds nor the undersigned has any influence called dfds customer service today to rebook my journey to be made in instead alternatively get my paid money back after queuing for a maximum of minutes i got to speak to a very welcoming and friendly employee who informed me that unfortunately they could not see a year ahead why rebooking could not be done but that dfds would reimburse me the full amount paid it is by far very good service best regards see you in booking no
mega bad style from dfds ridiculous return amount booked a return trip to oslo in connection with a holiday in norway the holiday was canceled due to covid but dfds would not pay our money back to make everyone happy we would just rebook and use the amount for a mini cruise when the infection pressure had subsided but then comes the problem we could only get dkk etc out of dkk booking xx
dfds great even when things get tough for years dfds was always the ferry company which did go the extra mile whether there was an issue while booking correcting some details putting us on earlier ferry when we arrived way too early looking after us when there was issue with bad weather and ferries were delayed staff onboard the ferries the lot then covid arrived we travel frequently and had loads of trips already planned for the entire most companies refused to understand help and failed to offer credit or refund for nonrefundable flights accommodations and to a degree this makes sense especially since for all of these companies this pandemic must be a huge blow into their revenues but dfds immediately responded positively and offered a voucher later when the voucher was about to expire they extended the deadline and even though our original booking was nonrefundable they offered free cancelation on the bookings made with the voucher it was also clear that they did not had the details and voucher system ready at the beginning of the lockdowns but this did not stopped them in looking after their customers and sorting that side later absolutely great service well be using car ferries for many more years to come and dfds just made the choice much easier thanks guys and see you as soon as this mess will be over
unfortunately dfds has a zerorefund agenda when it comes to refunds related to coronacovid we had planned a trip to great britain and ireland in with different ferries all of them refunded without any problems pampo stena only dfds refused
last summer i booked a berth for three cars to france before lockdown or covid one with dfds and two through direct ferries also on the same crossing we were still able to go up to a couple of days before our due departure date then the government set the lockdown of our region also adding isolation rules on return and then france and belgium our destination also raised restrictions this meant that our trip was impossible it was doubtful frankly for a week or so before but we still hoped we would be ok i tried to get on line information from the website of dfds nothing at all was published about cancelling and getting refunds i also looked at out tickets which plainly said that if cancelled the tickets would not be honoured or that the cancellation fee would be the value of the ticket in other words no refunds i have checked with my tickets for this year they state the same i have since discovered that there is a voucher scheme for cancellations on complaining they have stated i did not cancel so i would not be reimbursed or be issued with some kind of voucher on my rebookings it seems to me i wont be the only one upset by this as it seems designed to wriggle out of any kind of payout yet they have the money for three vehicle crossings we did not use also the three we rebooked hoping for a voucher of some kind i am disgusted and after this trip will be using the tunnel i travel regularly several times a year no longer with these people
had booked a trip to oslo with the family before the whole world was hit by corona we paused the trip but had to face the fact that it would be difficult to get the hang of going i therefore sent an email stating that we would like to cancel the booked trip and after a short wait the money has now been returned it is quite conceivable that we will return and book another trip thanks for the help
my trip was ruined when i found out that you couldnt disembark in oslo it is simply so misleading on your website of course i dont buy an expensive trip to oslo to sit and stare at a boat for days fair enough that the facilities on board the boat are closed but the whole purpose of the trip is to get out and see oslo and when you are still sailing to oslo with danish passengers that you have to show a negative corona test to get ashore and you cant see anything about not being allowed to disembark on the website then you strongly assume that everything is running as normal normally but no i honestly feel really trapped and caught in also past i have written to you a couple of times by email and have not received a reply super bad service
i had a ferry booked with dfds through aferry i needed to change the date and just could not get hold of aferry they dont have a phone number or email to contact them and there was a problem with their system i left messages on facebook but they didnt respond i was feeling a bit panic stricken because the date was looming i decided to contact dfds direct and they were marvelous within a very short term they changed the booking for me and all is well
sailed from netherlands to newcastle with a month old puppy during the pandemic i was very pleased with our roomy cabin bed disabled as i had big dog kennel and luggage with me as i originally flew to netherlands from another country and the ferry crossing was the last leg of our journey staff were very helpful and was over the moon how good dog toilet and the dog walking area was at the deck compared to princess seaways tiny sand box protective measures were well organised and hand gel was made available dinner and breakfast was well organised too can highly recommend
corona conditions are ignored despite confirmation on the phone i traveled from klaipeda to kiel it was confirmed to me that due to corona the multibed rooms would only be occupied by people i even received a call back because the man on the phone was unsure after consulting the shipping company and superiors he was able to confidently promise me that there would only be one other person in the room well when we arrived what a shock the cabin was full of coughing and sneezing people an exchange was not possible i then sat down in the recliner there was more distance but this would normally have cost less i wrote to dfds and asked them to pay out the difference well see i will definitely report what happened i bought wifi internet for euros but it didnt work you can hardly or not surf at all i tried continuously for hours it was only when i arrived in kiel that all whatsapp messages went out and then only via my internet provider not via the wifi be careful making phone calls costs a lot of money on the ferry incoming calls cost euros per minute but an sms said outgoing calls cost euros per minute the humane prices for food are positive breakfast buffet euros large beer euros cocktails euros changes i was transferred euros as the difference so im changing the rating
i was very unhappy with the outward journey to the uk on it says on your website weve introduced several measures onboard including staggered boarding and disembarkation social distancing and the wearing of masks in public areas inevitably as cars roll on slowly there is a staggered boarding but these other measures were not met there was no control at disembarkation everyone just rushed in one go to the stairwells there was no announcement by vehicle for for example there were many groups scattered around who did not observe social distancing and there were many passengers falsely wearing masks while walking in the pubic area even one passenger with no mask he actually even went to the information desk but was not instructed to wear a mask by the staff there there was no announcement on boarding embarkation and arrival or disembarkation about any social distancing or mask wearing no reminder of what to do no instructions about how to behave further half of the ferry was closed off which meant that the passengers had to be in closer proximity to one another although you might state that a full clean of the ferry is only possible if half is occupied it is a fact that of infections are transmitted by aerosols whereas as only are transmitted through contact with surfaces so a priority would be to have plenty of space which would also allow for better social distancing basically there was nowhere for myself and my wife to sit away from other passengers a very uncomfortable situation in light of these insufficient measures to prevent virus spread we returned to france with brittany ferries rather than take the return dfds portion their covid measures are clear consistently adhered to and make one feel much safer i have to say
i am very happy with dfds i felt comfortable and safe the crew was very polite and friendly and i will be traveling with dfds again
i feel the need to leave a new review based on my most recent experience in december i travelled as a foot passenger to dieppe and everything was wellorganised clean covid protocol welladhered to staff were friendly it was the way ive usually found it before the pandemic made everything so difficult then you got my dad and i home safe just before christmas just before the borders closed i realise that everything is going to be more complicated and take some getting used to now the absolute disaster of brexit has come to pass but i wish you all luck
dfds are the best from booking to checkin to the calaisdover crossing in december everything was perfect friendly staff good service we had our dog in the car for the first time i was allowed to visit him in the hold with an escort and everything was great here too we always enjoy traveling with dfds tip offer cocoa or fruit tea for the children with the coffee at the freemeal due to corona
the outward journey was cancelled to date no response no refund no voucher because the outward journey was cancelled the return journey could not be made update the money has now been refunded it took a while but it is even better than a voucher thanks to dfds so stars instead of one
overall we have good experience booking with dfds we have been helped really good over the christmas period when boats got cancelled initially due to covid the dfds team provided good information was reachable by phone and rebooked when needed
the service was out standing was late for ferry because off covid testing outside dover ferry port no hassle was asked if i wanted to wait or be put on a ferry to dunkirk instead no hassleleaving ten minutes later than my original time was more than pleased with that free meal and drink was all so appreciated as i had drove all the way from glasgow yes pleased with the service
normally everything goes great i was always very satisfied but with the current pandemic situation it is catastrophic i could not travel to england because the english channel was closed i am trying to change my booking cancel it or get a credit by phone and email and nothing is possible i cant reach anyone and so is gone and there is no answer neither by email nor by phone instead i get a message asking me to rate you sorry if you want to reach one of you it is always nervewracking that is not possible i am aware that we are in an exceptional situation but even i have to do my job and hanging up in an unfriendly manner after being on hold for minutes is definitely not acceptable especially when you yourself are showing understanding absolutely not
first time dfds passenger staff made it very easy and took all the stress out of being on a ferry for the first time travelled from north shields to holland and the staff from the terminal to on the board ferry were very happy to help with any questions cabin was clean and comfortable when i had to change booking for return trip it was done easily by one phone call for travel that day
i was unable to get any germanspeaking information over the phone several times this resulted in the cabin being booked incorrectly and i then had to pay an additional to rebook the cabin
everything was perfect except for one small negative thing the power sockets in the cabins could be checked since some of them are wobbly and charging the devices is not always guaranteed you dont have to check them all the time i hope that this difficult time will soon be over im looking forward to being able to travel with dfds again in the summer christmas greetings
im traveling on from dover to franceim a customer years nowand because the port close that daynot my faulti pay fee to change the booking on next day dfds reply and promise full refund in daysall ok
as we have come to expect from dfds the sailing was great again both there and back everything went smoothly and everything was well organised just a note about the quotfreequot food that was included on the outward journey it was so busy when we arrived at the restaurant that we first sat down after half an hour we went to get food and everything we had was too cold about degrees celsius on the way back i immediately joined the quotqueuequot i was second in line and the food was again too cold to serve about degrees celsius in my opinion more attention should be paid to this because this is really not possible i put the word free in quotes because we had to pay about more for our return compared to last march which is quite an increase even though every company is having a hard time in this time of corona i have never experienced a product being increased so much
due to constant changes to covid restrictions in both norway and denmark i decided to postpone the trip i tried to change online but was informed that it was not possible i had to call a certain number this number i called but it was not attended at weekends tried per mail to change the journey but i was too late it is terrible to have to pay for an item that i do not receive due to their regulations why should regulations surpass all reason this is robbery
both times going to and coming from dover was late needed to be improved in that aspect
service is good thats the reason i chose mostly dfds i would give you if you come back to normal rates of crossings well now is a different situation so i do have understanding for increased rates offering meals is a good offer should be continued even after it will keep jobs safe this price cannot be justified with meals as i traveled with persons with you and paid very reasonable price this time we were and paid more
lovely boat and staff as always even in these times
we had missed our ferry and the staff was so kind to rebook our tickets to the following day without surcharge everybody was friendly and helpful
excellent onboard service by very friendly hardworking staff booking pages on website are very complex language not entirely clear due to some sloppy translation otherwise id have given this a fivestar rsting this was my th crossing with dfds this year happy to book again
all went well with the trip but boarding took an extra long time due to the extra checks all was clean and well run onboard thank you
unfortunately was advised that i was not able to continue my journey as the entry rules didnt include non citizens residents not the fault of dfds terminal staff were sympathetic helpful next day contacted call centre who issued a credit note which we will use for our summer holiday in june
with the economy fare i would prefer to have a bit of flexibility ie the possibility to board a ferry two hours before and after my booked time in case there are problems with getting to the ferry if this is allowed this information should be available on the website
really professional from embarking at dieppe to disembarking at newhaven crossing smooth with good covid practices in place my only little niggle was when we went to get a hot drink bearing in mind we sailed from france we were only allowed to use s to pay in rather than s whereas its always been either and i could quite understand why and neither could the chap serving me overall excellent though and far better value for money than other ferry service providers thanks dfds
bad weather but the ferry was comfortable the staff were friendly and professional i enjoyed the journey even though it was a rough crossing
paid for flexi ticket checked in and straight on next ferry hours in advance of booking limited choice of included meal but while simple it was pretty good rough weather but ship managed it well with quick crossing
we used dfds ferries klaipeda to kiel and dunkirk to dover the food on the first ferry was excellent if a bit overpriced we got around this by paying for one meal and having two plates as we are both small eaters cabin was clean and comfy for one night the dunkirk ferry was good as well and the complimentary meals were above expectations we arrived at dunkirk five hours early and got onto am ferry without any problem all in all two very pleasant voyages
although the ship left about minutes late from newhaven on thursday rd of december we were well informed and again as normal a very good service thank you again dfds its a shame that on the newhaven dieppe route there is not a loyalty programme
rebooked my ticket cancelled by covid in june to same time in the credit from the cancelled booking was short for meeting this years costs and that was despite being given a discount yes this time there is a free meal not my cup of tea looks like rip offs is the new norm
its probably the cheapest option to travel in between the uk and france with a vehicle it can take quite a bit of time for cars to be checked by customs with dogs etc customs officers were surprisingly friendly on both sides the boat was not super comfortable and the food available on board was not great but you get what you pay for
on time both the departure and arrival nice and safe sailing in a turbulent time an all round great service
not really your fault staff were cheerful and great but crossing had the feeling of a prison ship endless queuing with lorry drivers for a meal that was not good cold limited choice and no vegetarian options with ditch water coffee why could we not just buy a croissant and a decent fresh coffee sorry will use dfds again based on past trips but covid has turned a pleasant reasonable cost experience into a expensive necessary drudge sorry but you did ask for feedback
the team continue to serve very well despite the problems created by covid on this trip i could say that loading and unloading took much longer than usual the sign in t he shop window needs to be changed to reflect the fact that alcohol meters have not been a requirement for a long time
efficient ferry service helpful operators onboard wifi could be a bit faster website a bit slow especially for mobile devices
all good but long time waiting to board the ferry which did not leave at time given
due to the circumstances i was impressed about the fact that dfds managed to keep giving jobs to cooks and moreover by doing this this giving an extra to their customer whom they surely appreciated well done guys travelling with you even when going to denmark has always being a star and now even more
the safety features on board were excellent i felt safe which is why i gave a star rating i am a regular traveller and i have grown to accept the interminable waits when lorries are on deck but i do think we should be called down when we are ready to disembark i shall continue to travel with dfds
on boarded no messing nice crossing and off the other side all done with the minimum of fuss well done dfds carry on
i use the newhavendieppe route regularly i have never had a problem booking the trip even if i have had to ask for an amendment subsequently i cannot see my need to use any other way to france
very friendly and helpful staff very good atmosphere on the ferry we wouldnt travel with any other company
everything was easy smoothe no dramas just how it should be this is the first time i sailed with dfds and i will use them again i would recommend them for the route i used which was dieppe to newhaven due to the c procedures naturally the vessel cafe shop etc was very quiet but all funtional and adequate i took plenty of drinks and snacks as im vegan and used to doing that i was glad the ferry was still operating to be honest reasonable fare
easy crossing quick boarding and disembarkation given the social distancing we had everything we needed the ferry was clean and tidy and the staff helpful good value for money
tickets are not cheap you could say expensive im not happy when i have to overpay a lot for missing a ferrythere is no hour reserve at the ticket office
i would like to thank dfds and all their staff for providing such an excellent cross channel service the company seems extremely well run and all the staff always seem highly skilled valued and motivated the organisation of the catering facilities with a simple included meal for all travellers during the covid crisis was really appreciated by myself the toilet facilities on board are always clean and the ships in general are always clean inside and appear well maintained i have no hesitation in recommending dfds
the ship left on time and arrived on time so that was good i would like you to remind you passengers to take a travel sickness tablet if they are prone to sea sickness i think you could clean the ship a bit more
its a no brainer star a day long i travel every week and all the staff are friendly kind and very patient under the current circumstances we cannot fault the way the book you in to the wonderful staff on the ferrys only would be great to have more food on the plate for the price they charge but hey its personal choice well done dfds and will continue supporting you and hope we have a great new year x

i would like to thank dfds and all their staff for providing such an excellent cross channel service the company seems extremely well run and all the staff always seem highly skilled valued and motivated the organisation of the catering facilities with a simple included meal for all travellers during the covid crisis was really appreciated by myself the toilet facilities on board are always clean and the ships in general are always clean inside and appear well maintained i have no hesitation in recommending dfds
the ship left on time and arrived on time so that was good i would like you to remind you passengers to take a travel sickness tablet if they are prone to sea sickness i think you could clean the ship a bit more
its a no brainer star a day long i travel every week and all the staff are friendly kind and very patient under the current circumstances we cannot fault the way the book you in to the wonderful staff on the ferrys only would be great to have more food on the plate for the price they charge but hey its personal choice well done dfds and will continue supporting you and hope we have a great new year x
plus points a good price for the trip excellent ferry very easy to check in and get boarded large waiting and boarding area ferry departed on time both ways as we docked it was quick and easy to drive off nice coffee shop service on board plenty of comfortable chairs and tables onboardcrew were very friendly negative points better facilities at boarding area with toilets and coffee vending machines sign posted if they are available the ferry hot food could be of better quality the airline sleeper chairs although comfortable are still in the same layout so impossible to social distance if someone sleeps in your row
months in advance i book a return cherbourg rosslare going inside cabin weeks later back outside cabin cabin with window after payment you will receive an email with the title confirmation confirming this now days before the return trip i receive an email with an attachment and a title confirmation but this time with the cabin numbers the cabins are on deck and for the outward journey booked months in advance we get it turns out that we have to pay for get an indoor cabin on the return trip cabin their explanation afterwards is that there was a plumbing problem in the outside cabin its strange that after booking you get a room for the return journey exactly next to the room on your outward journey i was not explicitly informed of this change in advance and afterwards after a complaint no form of compensation was discussedstena line if you had given me cabin on the return trip i would have believed you
just used stena to and from ireland paid for premium both ways what a joke that is stena selling premiumis a totally dishonest misrepresentation on both crossings the premium stickers were ignored and we got off the boat last the docker told me youre not special when i complained about not receiving a paid for service he then lied that all the other cars getting off before us were also premium they werent stena youre dishonest and conning the public
we traveled from kiel to gothenburg with our large dogs a friendly employee gave us instructions at the schwedenkai in kiel and explained what to do next on the ferry we and our dogs were led straight to our pet cabin it was super clean and tidy everything on board was very well organized the dog deck was also big enough so that you could stay out of each others way the only thing that could be improved is the options for where the dogs can do their business otherwise we were very satisfied and would be happy to use stena lines services again
we traveled with stena line from frederikshavn to gothenburg in our m sprinter i cant understand the bad reviews here at all from booking to checkin and the journey everything went smoothly we set off and arrived on time we would absolutely recommend the shipping company at least for this ferry connection
a company that only wants to take money out of your pocket but has never heard of customer friendliness if you travel to sweden with a dog you will be locked in a room with even more dogs for hours if you want to cancel the grenaahalmstad crossing well months before departure due to circumstances the costs will be as high as what you paid the only answer you get is quotyou should have read the terms and conditionsquot pure theft
sailed from harwich to hook of holland on the stena hollandica beautiful ferry staff were very friendly and polite the ferry was immaculate clean our cabin was beautiful very comfortable meals on board very good not over priced good selection stena plus lounge is amazing staff cannot do enough for you good selection of nibbles wines coffee teas and cakes breakfast selection excellent really good value for the price return journey excellent
stena line its over pay attention to the general conditions he doesnt apply them cancellation of the ferry april due to damage no departure possible before days for all companies from rosslare to cherbourg forced to rent accommodation and eat for additional days under the conditions it is planned that it is euros per day and per person up to three days maximum we were four people when we called stena line we spoke to someone who spoke french and he explained to us that we should not exceed this amount of euros per day and per person making xx they only refunded exchange of emails for weeks and in the end not even getting a response from them its vomitinducing
got on the train for a hour journey on nd may to get to stenaline ferry in holyhead to go to dublin half way there my wife phoned to say she had checked stenaline and found that my ferry had been cancelled i had received no notification from stenaline about the cancellation after having to put a claim into them i eventually received a refund for the cancellation plus my return and train journey i then rebooked weeks later on th june and just about to depart for my journey when i checked stenaline updates and saw that the ferrys earlier had been delayed my wife telephoned stenaline and was assured my ferry would be fine and on time after hour train journey i reached stenaline ferry port only to be told that my ferry would be delayed by minutes due to frieght lorries arriving late and having to wait for them i eventually got on the ferry and it arrived at pm instead of pm yet they would not let the foot passengers off and let the frieght lorries and the cars off first before sending the bus to get the foot passengers by the time i got off it was just past pman hour later than it should of been and i had to pay extra for my connection from dublin due to the extra hour delay i emailed to complain and was advised no compensation as the ferry was not an hour late apprentley they dont count the fact they wont let foot passengers off the ferry before lorries and cars i will never travel on stenaline again they seem to treat foot passengers as non entities and actually prefer lorries and cars giving them priority over boarding and getting off the ferry also waste of money paying for the stena lounge at as the meals are small but expensive plus the free food you get with your payment are just really small bite size peices of cake etc also all the good seats are taken up by the car and lorry drivers who are allowed on before the foot passengers never again as stenaline just dont seem to care about the foot passengers at all
we traveled with stena line from rosslare to cherbourg on june th it is impossible that this line transports around young calves on trucks during the crossing calves are transported here for hours without being cared for by holidaymakers in camper vans on foot and in cars not only do the animals scream for hours because they are hungry and thirsty they also stand in their own excrement so that the whole ship stinks miserably for the entire crossing but with stena they certainly think that money doesnt stink
booked with stena months ago got premium in case dates changed on way back from dublin to holyhead had mis read timing and had inadvertently booked for in the morning rather than the afternoon luckily had premium and girls at the gate really helpful so got on at no extra charge recommend getting premium and lounge was nice as well
sailed from harwich to hook of holland eifficient and polite service from everyone that we dealt with a bit pricy but a pleasurable way to travel
made a crossing from cherbourg to rosslare on what fantastic service i was almost happy that i am disabled we were helped with everything when booking there was no person cabin available but when we came on board it turned out that one had become available due to cancellation when asked what we had to pay extra we received a surprising answer we were also placed close to the elevator when boarding your breakfast is brought to your table a table is reserved for you near the desk in short nothing is too much stena line is highly recommended for people with disabilities
payed for premium tickets wast of money on the belfast to liverpool route was placed first in my row but kept to last to load poorly organised wont bother going premium again on this route no benefits over budget still sitting waiting to board at when the ferry is due to leave at whats premium about that
the ferry left rosslare late and arrived in cherbourg hours late no reasons were given after the ferry docked we had to wait over an hour to get onto the car deck no reasons were given then we had to wait again so that we could finally leave the ferry there was no staff that we could have asked for
the ferry ride with everything that went with it was great very nice staff but this ferry supports animal transport many trucks with sheep and young calves that spend hours in uncertainty on the ferry partly in exhaust fumes squashed tightly together separated from their mothers far too early screaming in panic fear their eyes wide open in panic and all just because we buy and eat the meat how much suffering is man willing to put up with in order to satisfy his insane meat consumption
i booked the harwich tto hook of holland earlier this year for a trip with three other freinds we all booked separately and all had our own vehicles i made a mistake on the the return dates by one day when i tried to change the return date by one day they charged me i challenged this and was told it was because it was sunday we were all charged at the original booking they are coming home on a sunday and my original was a monday so why have they ripped me off its discusting dover calais for me in future
we were booked to travel this morning st may on the day sailing unfortunately our car did not start and we missed the ferry i had flexi fare so was able to cancel and get a refund we sorted the car and i rang customer service and spoke to hayley who booked us on this evenings ferry and refunded the money i had lost her customer service was beyond excellent she was so efficient and sorted me out without any fuss a big thank you to her and to stena line
i booked for two people with a motorbike unfortunately one person dropped out at short notice from hoek van holland to harvich and returned days later and i travelled alone no chance of cancellation or refund then on board i withdrew pounds from the travelex machine and was charged the exchange rate would have been this is just pure ripoff and just for once and never again
i stopped using stena about years ago because we were being treated as second class citizens being abandoned on a bus with the doors open on a freezing cold day for at least minutes was the final straw naievly perhaps i thought things would have changed so we decided to travel from cairnryan to belfast we arrived minutes early and were left in the small and increasingly crowded reception area for nearly an hour no access to refreshments and an increasingly inadequate number of toilets we were told that we couldnt take our cases with us but were allowed to coming back why the difference when we were eventually allowed into the lounge area there was plenty of room and toilets no information was given as to when we would be able to start boarding so we decided not to get a cup of tea as we didnt want to have to carry it on to the ship if we had been in the car we would have access to all the facilities straight away we then had to wait until at least half the vehicles had boarded i did contact stena three times but have been ignored never again
we travelled on the early morning ferry from belfast to cairnryan on nd maythe staff were very helpful and in particular astrah who went out of her way to accommodate our request which we appreciated
first trip over the irish sea travelled from fishguard to rosslare we had booked a premium ticket to get priority embarkation and disembarkation this had the additional benefit of access to the stena plus lounge everything was very clean instructions were clear food and drink in the lounge was very good so overall very pleasantly surprised by the whole experience would be very happy to use stena line again
i had originally booked my trip with ttline from rostock to trelleborg and back for the return trip i was rebooked onto a stena line ship the ferry was being renovated i got a cabin to myself which was very comfortable clean and cozy but the general areas and the service were rather thirdclass compared to the competition if i could choose freely i would always prefer to book with tt
we have been travelling to ireland by ferry several times a year for years we have taken numerous ferry trips with different companies on april on the trip from rosslare to cherbourg with stena we were surprised that we were offered and sold a service that was then not provided when we booked it said quotevening buffet including beer table wine and soft drinksquot when we pointed out to the staff serving the food that the drinks were included in the price a very friendly conversation with the manager in charge followed he was aware of the problem that the german website referred to drinks that were included in the price but this service promise could not be fulfilled on board alcoholic drinks could not be purchased for dinner for an extra charge because there is no liquor license in irish waters i wonder whether your company is aware that selling services that cannot or should not be provided can have legal consequences it is not very customerfriendly when cars and trucks are combined on the deck in such a way that under the guidance of your staff you can only reach the staircase by pushing past a truck trailer we sent stena two emails unfortunately to no avail there is another way to be customerfriendly
travelled liverpool to belfast over nite trip through storm kathleen after flights where cancelled boat its self was clean and comfortable and was amazed at all on it from bar to restaurant to cinema and kids soft play area the staff where so friendly and accommodating especially katrina she went above and beyond defo will travel again
great company to deal with i had reason to contact customer services after our trip and they were absolutely brilliant went above and beyond what i expected also great crossings both ways on very comfortable well laid out ferries staffed by friendly helpful people highly recommended
i loved travelling with stena line it was my first time on a ship so i was pretty scared it turned out much better than i expected the employees were nice the only thing i didnt like was that you have to pay for a seat or anything else but everyone on the ship slept whenever they wanted some random guy got into our seats and we were shocked because why we have to pay for some seat if we can sleep whenever we want okay if you take your room but hello in my opinion having to pay for a seat is not that important cause i promise you will see sleeping people everywhere on the ship but everything else was great thank you for your service and nice experience with stena line
we booked the ferry from cherbourg to rosslare the ferry was cancelled twice on the outward journey and twice on the return journey as we had to go home again we had to rebook the ferry from rosslare to england which was hours late and we werent on the ferry yet midnight weve never experienced anything like this before and cant recommend this company at all an absolute disaster
good checkin friendly staff clean cabin and good beds tip from guest service about local time and consumption in interterritorial waters put your phone on airplane mode when the boat leaves the port and turn it on again when you arrive this means no unnecessary telephone costs during the trip you will have dutch time and the correct local time upon arrival and deactivation
blatantly ripping off tesco customers i got quid voucher from my club card to use with stenna went to book the ferry got child goes free cost was there was nowhere to put the voucher number so i did a bit of googling and turns out to use your tesco voucher you have to log into stenna through the tesco club card site so thats what i did the kids go free had disappeared the price increased to i thought that cant be right so i went back to the start incase i clicked something i shouldnt have no that was the price i logged into stenna again normally so not through tesco inputted the same data adults child and got as the cost so basically stenna are ripping off tesco club card holders youre not getting a deal because they charge tesco customers nearly quid more put in a complaint but ive heard absolutely nothing i have the screen shots i dont expect a reply here like most companies would it would seem they ignore the plight of their customers which shows they actually dont care
why did i pay more at stenalinenl while the exact same trip via stenalinese costs less simple cabin for a family of people plus car and trailer kiel gothenburg return isnt this pure theft if you are going to sweden or norway never book via stenalinenl but directly via the country you are going to in this case stenalinese sweden stenalinenl literally plucks you bald
th trip with stena stupidly made the mistake of booking the wrong departure and destination i missed one ferry so i pushed my holiday back by one day then i called customer service who adjusted the ports and times for me and i received a new booking reference all within minutes and no charge due to flexi ticket good discount for short stay journey i appreciate how easy everything is made with them no hassle or fuss port staff at the reception in dublin couldnt care less if youve problems though
twice within two weeks the cherbourg rosslare crossing was cancelled at short notice by stena line due to technical problems another rebooking would have been possible online but as we had no choice but to postpone the trip again we were again forced to cancel the crossing by phone at the irish branch in addition to the frustration of the cancelled holiday there are also the costs of the travel cancellation insurance and telephone charges as only the ferry costs are reimbursed this is at least fairly straightforward nevertheless after this experience we will probably not use stena lines services again
easy to book easy to board but an absolute appalling experience other than that now that theyve changed the public deck youre no longer allowed to lie down on any of the sofas i was told i have to book a cabin if i want a nap now ive paid nearly and drove from am and im not allowed to have a power nap on a hour journey without booking an additional cabin your finest daylight robbery shame on you stenaline ive travelled on this ferry a dozen times or more over the past few years but now youve really outdone yourselves
parking fine of from horizon for staying minutes in a minute holyhead stena carpark we were delayed in picking up dog and foot passenger only because stena took so long to embark bus loads of foot passengers robbery whaf were we supposed to do we arrived at the scheduled time not early and left promptly
we had a great experience crossing from rosslare to cherbourg using the pet friendly cabin with our french bulldogs the fact that we could have our dogs with us was our primary choice when booking the journey with stena line and we are so glad we did their customer service is outstanding and all the staff is very kind we were foot passangers and had loads of luggages with us every member of the staff we crossed offered us help thanks for making our journey so pleasant cannot recommend the service enough
a company that hellbent on maximising profits they give you the pleasure of paying inflated phone charges to enquire of the costs of asking for an earlier boarding which was even more expensive than doing it online which was proving an issue hence the call will be avoiding if other options in the future
do not use your vouchers on this you are instructed to visit the stena website for crossings and prices economy or flexi for me you can then only book it through a link in the email where the fare then escalated to by this time we had redeemed our worth of tesco vouchers so we went ahead and booked the crossing for the i sent an email to stena customer services compaining and received a very curt reply saying i should have rung tesco for a refund of the vouchers and they have thousands of happy customers the vouchers are only worth double anyway so better to use them elswhere
i liked the punctuality the service on board was bad no hot food and dirty toilets breakfast minutes before arrival in rostock the service staff nibbled at the buffet which is an absolute nogo in my opinion we were on the night ferry from trelleborg to rostock i wont use this option on the next tour
as a truck driver we are treated absolutely shockingly expected to share with a total stranger when you have plenty of cabins all because it revolves around the cars food is a disgrace left overs from previous trip new ferrys far to small for volume of trucks but as normal we dont count do we and many many more complaints far to many to mentionabout time you thought and respected the truck drivers whos company pays for a so called pleasant trip no chance get a grip stena and think about us drivers who are working not jollying on your ferries we should be priority not just when summer months are over we are with you all year round
we were always very happy with stena line until we took our dog with us he wasnt allowed on deck which was not explicitly stated when we booked but spent hours in a small room with other extremely stressed animals we could watch it all on our cabin tv the room was filled with engine noise the dogs gnawed on the bars and barked the boxes were big enough despite this i will never take this ferry with a dog again
liverpool to belfast all was fine and then on board spoke to lady at customer reception rude and cheeky to customers i pain for premier which i thought you embarked and debarked first how wrong was i i was one of the last cars off the boat mins after we docked then trying to get out the docks took another mins next time i will fly and hire a car that was shambles
a big compliment for stena lines on friday february th we traveled with the stena skandinavica from kiel to gothenburg and one day later back to kiel we really enjoyed the time on board punctual departure and arrival great breakfast good food clean cabins and very friendly service thank you stena lines wed be happy to come back anytime
great experience with stena from rosslare to cherbourg on one of the newer ships they have on the route facilities are excellent and food is well priced unlike irish ferries who are very expensive added bonus is that you can take your dog into the cabin with you
this ferry was completely off the beaten path and well worth the trip it was a very low maintenance experience which helped tremendously given we were in dublin over the weekend this ferry to the uk was an awesome low stress treat for both of us i would recommend this x if i ever needed to travel between ireland and uk again
it was the first time i took a ferry with my assistance dog in training from kiel to gothenburg and back we had really good and friendly interactions with the service staff my assistance dog in training was allowed to stay on the ship where no other dogs were allowed the staff immediately recognized the designation and allowed us entry super positive thank you
went to rosslare to pick up foot passenger from fishguard ferry was hour and a quarter late in no announcement in either the terminal or as my guest confirmed on the ferry either i was informed by a couple of helpful customs officials that there was a problem with the ferry engines subsequently trying to book a return journey scheduled sailings on consecutive days were cancelled reason given the weather as irish ferries havent cancelled sailings on same route i suspect stena are telling lies and the reason is mechanical issues
stena lines customer service team are awesome on our outbound journey we got caught in a traffic jam it got to the point where we werent going to make the boarding deadline so we called customer services quickly painlessly changed our booking to the ferry the traffic jam cleared we got to the terminal minutes after the deadline the checkin lady changed our booking back to sailing and we got onboard without any issues we then wanted to change our dublinholyhead booking to belfastcairnryan another call to customer services and this was resolved in a few minutes with a minor cost increase that included upgrade tostena lounge access on both occasions we immediately got to speak to a human a very helpful understanding human no long prerecorded message no complicated menus no waiting in a queue just instant service so refreshing the ferry journey was very pleasant stress free as well
after a long trip from nw to sw of the uk full of unexpected delays managed to get the ferry to hook of holland with the amazing help of alissa in h of h and a gentleman whos name i cant remember in harwich they both went out of their way to help out and that is amazing personal touch in times where business gets more and more just about rules and profit great experience and thank you to alissa and the unknown gent
excellent facilities on board cabin spotless comfortable journey on stena vision from rosslare to cherbourg absolutely fabulous staff my favourite were jelena in the duty free shop who was courteous most helpful polite and a joy to be in her company also a special mention to troy a true gentleman most helpful with a happy and bubbly personality if all crew were like this it would be great best ferry best crew well done jelena and troy from catering five stars
outbound trip canceled return trip canceled we had to shift one day later and then one day before our vacation was cut short by days unreliable company
i have to use stena four or five times a year from cairnryan to belfast a regular ticket and if there was any alternative i wouldnt use stena dreadful service and rip off pricing no competition it is telling that stena do not respond to feedback here and that their rating on reviews is less than positive
travelled dublin to holyhead on the stena adventurer in july from start to finish the journey was fantastic stress free lovely comfortable ship extremely friendly and helpful staff good food my elderly aunt who has very reduced mobility travelled with me on the return journey and stena couldnt have been more accommodating early boarding parking at the lift and staff on hand to help whenever needed cannot fault my experience its ferry all the way for me from now on
cherbourgrosslare disastrous processing we completed all the formalities and passport control three hours agosince then we have been standing in line in front of the ferry a few trucks keep driving off to the right and leftcars that have just passed passport control can already board workers are standing around doing nothing at the entrance to the ferryofficial departure is in minutesmaybe we can still get on board
we travelled cherbourg to dublin on the stena vision staff were amazing everyone super friendly and kind what an awesome culture i could tell even the other passengers were being kind and polite also this culture rubs off on everyone great job team
travelled with stena twice across the irish sea and both times have been a calamity the first crossing consisted of watching staff conduct an emergency meeting in full earshot of customers causing a panic in relation to a fire below deck on my current crossing i have been informed we need to slow down due to a technical issue stretching a three and a half hour crossing to nearly and a half hours there was no explanation as to what this issue may be or no mention of recompense for customers missing travel connections on the other side stena line are by far the worst transport service i have ever used and i can safely say i will be sticking to the more reliable irish ferries from now on to top it off when the announcer advised that our minute delay in arrival from was going either going to be or i mean come on its tells you all to know basic maths or a definitive arrival time may be nice utter joke
booked a passing between trelleborg rostock with ttline that was operated by stena line we booked a cabin so we could get some sleep because we had been driving for hours and had more hours to go apparently ttline didnt send this information in our booking to stena so we didnt get a cabin stenas personell didnt try to help us at all except from two things first was that the only thing we could do was to contact ttline about our situation but ttline wasnt available until hours after departure time second thing was that we should book with stena instead of tt yeah right never using either stenas or tts services again paid for a cabin ended up having to sleep on the floor
appalling arrangements in place to check in cars into the terminal belfast to liverpool ferry nov the blond lady came into her kiosk late and started checking in cars mins late than apparent computer glitch unnecessary moving of cars into different lanes and i had to wait a long time in spite of getting into car queue by the whole team was fumbling as if it is day of the ferry service need efficiency at the check in counters please
we were on vacation in sweden with scandlines and had booked a crossing on august th from trelleborg to rostock the day before we received a text message informing us that we needed identification documents for the trip we hadnt brought any id for two of our three children because they dont have any yet when we arrived at the port we were strictly turned away because of ids were missing we werent offered any help or alternatives the only thing that mattered to the lady was that we clear the lane there was no reference to the necessary identification documents on the website or on our booking confirmation extremely negative experience with this company
positive the ferry was on time you can go up to the top deck and get some fresh air negative the food is of the lowest category at night they dont dim the lights so you cant really sleep without a blindfold the free internet is very limited the transfer drops you off in travemnde at an office complex with a bus connection it would be better to drive a few meters further to the train station
absolute scum travel times a year boat never in time and have to wait for other passengers every time before it leaves well after close time i got there bang on time on boxing day and told that they wouldnt let me on because security had to head on even after explaining i was severely disabled and medical issues to attend they wouldnt care less what scum will never use again
when i wanted to take two of my own dogs the guy at the reception desk in hook of holland accused me that i was going to sell the dogs in the uk which is totally untrue and based on nothing at all finally i could go through but it was very unpleasant i think stenaline goes way too far by criminalizing their own customers i have been traveling for years now with stena line but since this instance it doesnt feel like they are there for good willing passengers
recently booked and had an issue with my booking i didnt expect much help when i called to be honest judging by how poor customer service typically is these days with most companys i have dealt with so to have such a positive experience and outcome the level of customer service i received today has restored my confidence that it is actually possible to feel heard and cared for as a customer even for such a small booking as mine thank you stena line
bad service we were delayed with the train so we called stena line customer service the only number we could find that man said bluntly that we were unlucky that the boat was really not going to wait and that we should hurry up because we didnt want to risk missing the boat we ultimately took a bus which would take us to our destination anyway half an hour later we got a call from the ferry itself who said they would wait if passengers were late bad luck and a shame that customer service did not communicate this
what a truly amazing experience my first time on stena line upon boarding the ship i was greeted by julia schulz at customer relations she gave me all the information i needed to know and we saw her several times throughout our journey she recognized us and acknowledged that we were ok giving us more than attentive service and assisting us on getting a cabin if this lady is a representation of stena line we will most definitely be using the service again
i have several bad experiences with stena line the customer service does not onderstand the word service they are rude and customer unfriendly the latest bad experience i have had when i had selected a trip for a specific price when i wanted to do the payment the price had suddenly been increased a lot i have complained about this but stena line does not care stena line is by the way far too expensive euros for person in a car in the cheapest bunk on the route kiel gteborg is crazy my recommendation avoid this company too expensive no service
travelled on both embla and edda ships on stenna plus from liverpool to belfast once overnight crossing and recently daytime on both occasions the experience was amazing both ships spotlessly clean standard of complimentary snacks drinks and hot food was exceptional staff were friendly helpful and professional well done stenna would definitely recommend
booked a ferry from rosslare to fishguard for and accommodation in pembrokeshire as the ferry arrived at hours i was later informed the ferry was cancelled due to operational reasons upon contacting stena customer services anna tommis the matter was immediately resolved with stena offering a full refund for the booked accommodation and paying the cost of fuel as we have to catch the ferry from dublin to holyhead excellent customer service without any fuss i would definitely travel with stena again and recommend to anyone star rating
just traveled on stena line belfast liverpool just wanted to post what a pleasant experience it was all the staff i met with on the trip were very friendly and professional the ship inside was clean and even though busy didnt seem overcrowded best crew members were the two i met in the restaurant so happy and helpful at on a sunday morning stars stena
all thumbs up i was a little worried about the crossing with children aged between and of which my yearold son is autistic and has a care level of when we booked they did everything they could to ensure that we had a pleasant crossing so we had a cabin on the outward and return journeys it was very conveniently located so we could go on deck for a while without others feeling disturbed by felix and vice versa the range of things on board was also topnotch and the staff very friendly we highly recommend it
we had to change our sailing and the staff chelsea and lindsay on the phone were helpful endlessly patient in helping us work out our options weve also sailed on the hook of holland to harwich crossing and had a lovely experience
got to the boat ok and told where to go that was it i had to find my own ratchet straps to strap the bike down then we just sat in the harbour for over an hour no communication from the staff we then sat outside rosslare for another mins then finally to top it off the door wouldnt open on the deck i finally landed two hours late and had a very cold dangerous ride to belfast with a high risk of accident late at night i had complained to them but no response
son partner g children have just arrived on the nordica unfortunately none of us were aware the previous ship has been decommissioned ive been on the nordica before its a serious downgrade son and family are v disappointed no soft play for young children this ship is like going back to the old days in the s the st david thats it im off to the competition
traveled from belfast to cairnryan on sunday ferry before us had technical difficulties so we docked hours late staff and company were wonderful looking after us with free tea coffee and bacon rolls some had been on their feet hours nonstop wonderful staff however i have to deduct stars for the absolutely chaotic boarding policy for vehicles if you pay for priority boarding youre looked after we were one of the earliest to arrive but the last to board no point getting to the ferry early there is no first come first served its an absolute lottery come on stena this is easy to fix
my wife and i travelled with stena from cherbourg to rosslare on the stena horizon we normally travel with irish ferries but the prices and timings of stena were cheaper and more convenient the staff on board the ferry were all extremely friendly and helpful the ship was clean and on time two negative points boarding took far too long and the free wifi was useless
dublinholyhead and return boat have been very good service for me over the last years i have found the boarding and disembarking well done and service on board has been friendly and helpful i switched to stena after not getting great service on another carrier and i am glad i did
we were travelling from hollyhead to dublin for holiday and back unfortunately the ferry is not very dog friendly there are not enough kennels or dog friendly rooms so you have to leave your dog in the car all cars alarms gone off continuously no one likes leave there four legged friends behind everything else was fine and ferry was on time
these guys really dont cater to foot travellers in a car you should be fine but by foot youll have to wait an extra hour then car parking machines are broke and the customer service disappear when you need help as you can see in the picture im waiting there while cleaners are preparing for the next ferry
embarkation and disembarkation with endless waiting times and delays on both trips cherbourgroslare and back they obviously dont have the logistics under control but i wont try it again with this shipping company to see if that was an exception
the wait to get off for a foot passenger is ridiculous we waited minutes to disembark literally all the other passengers had already left you need to improve this theres no reason to make passengers wait this long after a long journey
ferry crossing from lipeja latvia to travemnde company stena line here too the same experience as between denmark and sweden and kiel to gothenburg the condition of the ships has deteriorated considerably the quality of the food is at a very low level where possible we take a different ferry connection
as a regular user of the stena line liverpool to belfast ferry and return journey i know what to expect my trip wasnt booked well in advance like normal it was a last minute thing so there were no cabins available so i opted for a hyggie chair i did the journey over from liverpool on the stenna edda in the morning then returned on the same boat at night i spoke with the staff at guest services who said call and see them on my return and they will put me on the list in case a cabin came available this i did once back on board feeling rather tired having already been on the go for hours i had the card for the stena plus lounge so julia at guest services told me to go there get some nibbles drink and chill and if anything comes available she would let me know this julia did she even came to the plus lounge to find me personally and for her great service this is why i am leaving this review stena line julia is an outstanding member of your team she went out of her way to help me she is an asset to stena line thank you julia and thank you stena line
just returned from a trip to nireland via liverpool taking the overnight boat both times this is th consecutive year weve made this trip and have enjoyed it every time we do splash out for the double bed cabins they are spacious and the beds extremely comfortable it is a shame we need to get out of them at am i would only have one ask despite multiple warnings during booking checkin and boarding there always seem to be multiple cars who do not turn their alarms off i have started mentioning this to the offending drivers in the morning usually they arent even aware they have an alarm fair enough i didnt know mine had until i looked i think stena could do a bit more to get the message across unless your car is ancient you almost certainly have an alarm on it even if you dont realise it so tell people that and maybe a polite note under the windscreen of the offending cars to let them know
very prompt responses before travel regarding arrangements for a passenger using a wheelchair petfriendly cabins worked brilliantly for us and all the staff we met were very friendly and helpful
stenaline cairnryan to belfast staff at the dock entrance staff at the boarding gate staff on board travelled april rebooked to travel april but had to postpone was due to travel this week sept but unfortunately couldnt contacted stena for some help as we cant go till april and they couldnt of done more to help im absolutely delighted with this company couldnt fault anything with them
cairnryan to belfast nothing wrong with the boat and all the staff seemed nice enough the price is pretty high but you take it or leave it i guess my main complaint was that the stena plus lounge was like a mad house i didnt even bother staying in it from the moment we went in there were kids yelling and running around running up an launching themselves at the rotating armchairs to see how fast they could make them spin climbing over the tables chairs fighting and arguing perhaps this is more of a parenting issue but i think that when kids are causing a significant disruption to other passengers the staff should step in an ask them to calm down overall a decent service but dont waste your money paying for the stena plus lounge
for the second year in a row at christmas my trip home has been delayed significantly i appreciate there can be adverse weather but just today they contacted to say that they have swapped ships for the day of my delayed boat they didnt ensure that i could get a pet cabin even in the next crossing which means the next available crossing to cherbourg with pet cabin isnt until days jan after my intended travel date dec just cant take the uncertainty and if you delay someones travel twice you should be able to guarantee that you will be able to travel with your pet additionally in august we booked a cabin and when we arrived we realised someone had wet themselves in one the bunks and they hadnt changed the sheets they refunded the tickets but not a great start to the trip all this being said i do want to say that the staff on the ships are so nice and welcoming
there was no parking available at the two small holyhead car parks so we ended up parking in the old car park which no longer has a bus service and required a minute walk down a filthy badly lit road to the port when we got to the port there was nobody on the stena information desk it was closed and the irish ferries desk told us they thought the old car park was closed very helpful trip over was ok best described as functional but grubby on the trip back we and other foot passengers waited for nearly minutes to get on a bus the st bus driver apparently drove off with less than half the passengers as he wasnt aware there was anyone else waiting when we got back to the port we then had to endure the same minute walk in the dark this was at to the old long stay car park felt very unsafe and would be completely inappropriate for many of their less mobile customers overall really poor at best stena are incompetent amateurs with zero interest in customer experience
thank you to a brilliant ferry company for providing ontime comfortable crossings ferries are well mapped out and it is easy to find your way around the staff is always friendly very enjoyable i have lately been able to enjoy the stena plus lounge that i can warmly recommend
this review refers to the ferry crossing from kiel to gothenburg the terminal in kiel quite ok the terminal in gothenburg defies description lousy toilets waiting area too small and no kiosk or similar stena germanica the ship is ok the cabins are ok the buffet in the evening and breakfast in the morning are great the priceperformance ratio is ok stena scandinavica rusty the paint is crumbling and there is rust everywhere even on the lifeboats the cabins were only superficially cleaned the sink in the bathroom in my outside cabin was yellowed and stained the food was ok however there were hardly any desserts in the evening during the second shift
reg goteborgfrederikshavn its fine gets you from a to b ferries seem kinda old by now minus points for the employee that stank up the entire ship with perfume that smelled like candyfloss many passengers in the lounge were very annoyed by it
rosslare to fishguard as a foot passenger loading and unloading chaotic using a bus which has to reverse off the boat down the ramps to the dock long queue for check in at fishguard with only people at the desk took nearly an hour after docking in rosslare to be taken off again by reversing bus
i dont normally leave a review but i feel i need to commend the fantastic service and skill of the staff on the stena nordica ferry it was a very rough day to sail but we made it from holyhead to dublin comfortably and thats all down to the members of staff that went above and beyond to support us we have a month old baby girl and a year old son my son became very sea sick at the seating area with my partner and i was struggling to walk back from the toilet with my newborn at the same time a lady working at the food city restaurant and another young female member of staff came to our aid immediately they supported us to remove all of our belongings buggy jackets bags etc to a safer part of the ship while also cleaninghelping our little boy to feel better they did all of this with a high standard of professionalism and a good sense of humour the oss manager approached us only a few moments later and offered us a free cabin as they had one available she also escorted us to the reception area where another nice gentleman helped us to the room the teamwork excellent communication professionalism and kindness of all the staff mentioned above was absolutely outstanding hospitality at its finest i am only sorry i did not catch all of their names to thank them individually
service was great got to our destination safe and sound and on time but my problem lies with the website for changing tickets it says its quick and easy which is true but it tries to charge you again for a leg of your journey youv already done so its actuallycheaper just to miss the booking and book a whole new ticket this need to be fixed
we have travelled on stenaline to belfast from liverpool on th and from belfast to liverpool on th martin and the ladys on the desk were all very helpful throughout the journey on both occasions and we had a lovely trip
holyhead to dublin on stena horizon dreadful journey cabin no bottled water kettle or coffee vouchers that we have had on previous journeys duvet wasnt completely in the cover and was absolutely filthy the cabin was old and tired announcements at dublin welcomed us to holyhead then later came back on laughing correcting himself the information he gave was garbled and confusing very unprofessional our car was parked on the open air deck when told to return to car we waited behind a locked fence with no sign of any crew we couldnt get to our car we waited more than half an hour we tried an alternative route to find crew shouting at passengers in a crowded space chaos not a nice atmosphere at all we didnt leave the ship until well after o clock more than an hour after the ship arrived no sign of crew on the deck until minutes before we could leave people were wandering up and down the deck in disbelief when we had to reverse to drive off the ship the crew member directing us was rude and impatient a dreadful journey
we got here at hrs and still waiting to go on board the ferry after hrs this is shocking and waste of time considering most of us want to get on board and have rest or sleep since we have to work the next day and we pay over to be waiting around for almost hours pls you need to review timings that you load people and vehicles on board
travelled on the stena edda from belfast to birkenhead and the standard of customer care we experienced was exceptional from all staff we came into contact with one in particular to mention is courtenay who went out of her way to help us when our son was sea sick it really was a rough crossing my wife asked her for assistance when my son was ill in the cafe and she not only personally arranged for all his clothes to be washed and delivered back to our cabin with no fuss but supplied courtesy drinks and went out of her way to check on our welfare in addition the cafe staff were fantastic as were those staff who had the unenviable job of making sure the tables were continuously being cleared of waste keeping the place clean the staff on stena edda deserve special mention for their outstanding approach to customer care great to see
we have always treated the ferry trip as part of our holiday the last trip has left me ill with lung damage and i can only wish that i had never gone on that ferry during the outward and return trip no one tells the drivers not to turn on their engines during the outward trip some bully pushed us past level onto level not realising we walked across level where many cars were running their engines then we needed to walk back and up to level again vehicle engines were being run the return trip was no better i had no idea that i had been poisoned or of the long term consequences to my health carbon monoxide kills diesel fumes are lethal i am left using a machine to help me breath taking steroids and medication to help clear my system
we sailed with stena from harwich to the hook of holland and return september excellent service on time nice helpful staff and a really comfy cabin excellent
arrived in holyhead early was booked on the evening sailing dave was so accommodating and friendly getting us on the afternoon ship back to dublin thanks dave
after arriving into hollyhead from dublin i discovered that i had a flat tyre i managed to creep off the boat onto the dock side where i commenced changing the tyre at no point during this did a single employee bother to come ask if it was ok or needed a hand further despite the vehicle being clearly sign written as containing horses the chaps decided to fly past flat out visibly rocking the vehicle whilst clearly on a jack all i can say for a company that is nearly entirely customer facing a group of escaped baboons would do better as they would at least show some interest in the customers
we travelled on the nordica fishguard to rosslare and back again been travelling on stena europe for years this is a serious downgrade and yet stenaline charging more for the privilege nearly every member of staff looked totally miserable the boat is much smaller with much less seating space its dark with multiple stairways and very narrow treads queues for lifts for elderly or infirm were very long when disembarking car had to walk along side and across other boarding traffic very chaotic and dangerous food choices were less and were also poor cafe and duty free close really early we had stenaplus on way over and again very cramped with barely enough searing for all booked glasses crisps cups not replenished had to keep asking i heard a couple of staff complaining about the boat and i dont blame them seems to me that stenaline want to make more money pack more people in limit the staff and service and reduce size of ship bad show stenaline customer satisfaction and service is clearly not important to them at all
very good experience both ways liverpool belfast belfastliverpool staff was friendly and very helpful yes we did have to wait mins for a wheelchair but they upgraded us to plus lounge would recommend definitely
totally worthless they rebooked the ticket at the last second to a completely different time and you dont get anything back even though the ticket we first bought was clearly more expensive than the one we were forced to later
generally no problems with the crossing as such but they have chosen to place such a slot machine where the children have to kick a football just outside the room where you pay extra to have peace of mind and a seat that can lie down that looks bad style it makes noise from h to
update reply from nicola marsh apologising for what happened and off voucher issued should i book with them in the next months my experience will aoso be flagged to marketing team was due to sail on estrid dublin to holyhead on on am sailing was about to leave home to head for port when i received text message the ferry was cancelled and i had been transferred to advdnturer at am on arrived at port to be told there was a hour delay also no pet cabins available albeit i had booked one for my initial sailing a very stressful and unacceptable situation for lone female travelling with nervous dog return journey on nordica pet cabin not as described as no pet mats drinking bowl or tea coffee makings completed complaints form but heard nothing so rang customer services they stated they had no knowledge of my complaint even though i had received an automated e mail acknowledging receipt of complaint together with a reference number i was advised to e mail head of customer service nicola marsh which i have done but still awaiting response i have requested an update before taking this matter further
on thursday th november i traveled from dublin to holyhead on the stena adventurer it was lovely when we got to holyhead we were told to go down to our cars and be ready for disembarkment when i got to my van i saw one of the tires was fully flat rim sitting on the ground two stena line mechanics in holyhead came to help paul clarke and owen hughes they were so helpful and helped get the spare wheel on after that they told me to drive to their garage and theyd plug the flat wheel and also rebalance it also ensured all tires were topped up with air after this they put the spare tire back in its place under the van etc and i was good to go i asked them how much i owed and they told me i owed them nothing at all absolute gentlemen i hope the correct people see this and reward the boys appropriately top job lads thanks again
yet again another disaster in trying to get accross the irish sea on time with stena line i arrived today at to get on the went through security with no talk of delay until the usual tactic of arrive at the kiosk to be told of a delay of two hours without warning then after sitting inside the compound we received official notification of the delay by text at it wouldnt be so bad if they anything half decent to eat in the so called cafe a few slices of cake and two cookies that resembled ice hockey pucks shocking if we had advance notice we could have went into stranraer and sat down to eat and relax it certainly is not cheap on this ferry and have travelled this route for years and it will be the last if the adverse weather early in the day was the so called excuse why were we not informed early in the day thats simple as it would give you the opportunity to cancel and they wouldnt want that
super bad customer service i went from denmark to sweden when i was years old with my yearold friend we had no problem buying a ticket for a oneday trip where we took the ferry home at pm then when we got to sweden we were told that we had to leave before pm because we were under nothing place it warned or stopped when we bought the ticket online we even had to pay to change our ferry to pm i was then told by the lady in sweden that i should write an email to their customer service to get the money back but no they write very rudely that it does not meet the requirements for a refund as it was stated somewhere on their website we were two yearolds quotstrandedquot in a foreign country because they dont warn about it but they dont care
one thing in advance the cabin was in perfect condition the breakfast was as expected canteen level but the checkin area in trelleborg for passengers on september nd i had the dubious quotpleasurequot of getting to know the checkin area in trelleborg and i have to say i was really shocked that is absolutely unworthy of an international ferry company they expect passengers to have to use a waiting area without toilets possibly for a long time in my case from pm because i was on the way back from bornholm not to mention that there was no way to buy something to drink or eat snacks bikers wandered around because it was not clear where to check in at some point the waiting room was full of bicycles people were sitting on the floor the fact that a scandinavian ferry line in particular deals with alternative travel options so unprofessionally shocked me or are these travelers less valuable to them because they dont generate as much revenue the fact that we were the last ones on the ferry at around pm and therefore had no chance to eat something in peace is the icing on the cake oh no rostock was even better who actually thought of not sending the shuttle bus onto the ferry the stairs down to the bus are a nightmare with a lot of luggage and torture for older people all in all this experience was not an advertisement for stena and alternative travel for anyone involved
stenaline ferry company to avoid yesterday scheduled departure from rosslare at pm actual departure at pmno text message to warn of the delay and not to go to the platform hours in the car like dogs arrival today scheduled for noon its pm and i still havent left the ferry
we travelled to belfast from liverpool on the overnight ferry it was a very good experience all round checkin was good and the man who directed us after checkin could not have been nicer waiting time for the ferry was good space for cars was good and you did not need to shoehorn yourself in and out of your vehicle our cabin albeit premium was the best cabin i have stayed in we took a ferry from ireland to bilbao a couple of weeks earlier which took hours and the cabin was small and cramped we ate in the restaurant on board and took our drinks in with us from the bar the food was good and there were about six choices of main dish the ferry is new so no signs of wear and tear for premium we had tv ensuite double bed and door out onto deck coffee machine and snacks provided very nice experience
we traveled from kiel to gothenburg on august no consideration was given to my handicap the staff were completely rude and rude the food was as is often the case bad every time we eat in the trucker lounge we are sick that night in the morning we couldnt get down in the elevator because it was suddenly blocked it said quotfirequot on the elevator if a fire had broken out the ship would have been evacuated we had to use the stairs which was very difficult with my handicap on the stena the service was completely reduced we travel on the stena for work
incredibly disappointing experience we should have taken the ferry frederikshavn gothenburg on july at as walking passengers we left home in good time and arrived at the parking lot by the ferry at already here there was chaos and over cars driving around to find a parking space the cars were already parked on the grass along the fence next to the road we gave up finding a space here and were subsequently at other parking spaces in the area all with limited parking or an app that didnt work so we couldnt park anyway at at the choice was to throw the car away and get a parking fine of dkk or to drop it and lose the dkk that the ticket had cost us we chose the last option when i contacted stena line to explain the situation there was not much help to be had the only refund option was that we could rebook our ticket for another time for dkk extra and risk being in the same situation with a lack of parking spaces no thanks really bad of stena line that it is not possible for your walking passengers to get off the car and onto the ferry then you simply have to expand and create more parking spaces or stop overbooking your ferries really a pity that you have no competition on the route you can obviously allow yourself to treat customers that way
staff and people are very well organized and trained and i was very satisfied with the boat service recommended xo
car broke down couldnt get on board car was towed back to country of origin by car club no refund or any chance of rebooking on another time so i wont book them again
never scammers and thieves after payment they modify the booking confirmation and require additional payment before boarding nasty ship ride the tt line they are
im a frequent ferry user holyhead to dublin my experience on stena has been substandard this occasion i was due to leave am and h before departure a gale force kicked off trees near my house were uprooted everything forecast well ahead rather than have some foresight and advise times were at risk they kept the on time notification on the website until the early hours i checked it at am they waited till after am to text informing me they were leaving an hour early and check in was closing am for a am sailing i have a habit of being asleep at am so woke up realising that arriving minutes early as planned would see me missing the ferry i lost time waiting for customer services to open and getting in a flap about what to do i wasnt able to make it as id never even heard of it going early before given that i live minutes from the port and trees in my area were getting uprooted h before departure they cant say they had no warning ive just never expected it to go early without me the consequences of missing the ferry were harsh i missed quality time with my partners family who will mostly be on their way home by the time i arrive i was supposed to be in dungarvan for pm but now arrive after pm some earlier communication would have helped given the storm was in place h before i would have just gotten to the port with h to spare they said it was captains decision but they could have predicted the time was at risk and offered some info before am customer services responded quickly they were apologetic but overall they came across as defensive and dismissive sticking to their guns my complaint was about how it was communicated badly at am i did get off my next sailing but this is out of times myselfpartner have had a bad experience off at least would have been fair for someone who is a frequent traveler
after many sailings as a cross channel hgv driver and also personal sailings in my own car i have finally decided to leave some form of a review which i have never done before the pure and utter disrespect towards customers is a shame and disgrace from checking in security and basically every point of contact with a stena line staff member in general from my experience travelling as an hgv driver i found that i generally get more respect from the stena line staff than i would when i travel as a car passenger which is surely some form of discrimination could be the fact that it is the hgv industry that keeps the stena line vessels sailing but at the end of the day the price for return car crossing costing avg is an absolute kick in the stones for most customers on the other hand ive been using irish ferries more often now as id rather travel down to dublin for a much more professional service just a pity they dont sail from belfast
genuinely a great journey with stena from birkenhead belfast as soon as i was onboard the ferry stena embla you stop youre car turn of youre car alarm and then grab whatever you need from youre car just to mention you cant go down to youre car so make sure to grab everything you need and head up the stairs to whatever deck you want to go on as soon as we found our seat i unpacked my stuff and sat down the seats were comfy and you could sleep on it if you wanted too loads of people do it before we departed i went out on deck and i looked around for a bit and noticed a dog kennel thingy for dogs that if you had a dog you would need to put them in there you needed a code to enter the room for the dogs breakfast ends at around ish but we didnt know it did and when we asked for toast they said breakfast had ended but they had extra toast and gave it to us for free which in my opinion was very nice of them also people say the wifi onboard is bad but i managed to play a roblox game without too much lag or it crashing it was only for hours and unless you like a vpn then dont get the one as it isn t that different to the and all the difference is is a vpn so that certainly must be some good wifi during the journey i explored the ship and found cinemas a duty free that closed towards the end of the journey an arcade loads of cabins lounge a bar cafe multiple bathrooms and loads of other stuff however as we sailed farther away from the river mersey the waves got worse and worse and the winds were getting worse to the point were they had to close the all the doors that led to the outside and we even had to sail towards scotland but this lead to some amazing views of scotland and the isle of man before those views i ate some vegan nuggets with some chips the good thing is is that you can get as many salt packets for free and ketchup and mayo but i didnt need any other than salt as everything was well seasoned and wasnt like those veggie nuggets from the s that were full of peas it was like if the mcplant was in a chicken nugget if you get me anyways it was quite good but if you are a foot passenger then i think you need to pay for like a bus ticket im pretty sure but overall it was a good review so thank you for reading this stars overall
stupidly my other half left his backpack on the ferry at cairnryan and we didnt realise until we got home a hour drive later we immediately filled out the contact form on their website no response we filled out another contact form and this time did get a response we explained that the backpack had been left onboard and that it contained two ipads a pair of binoculars and some cash we were informed that any lost and found property was taken off the boat on crew change over day wednesdays and that they would be back in contact with us we sailed on a friday and it was now saturday thankfully the other half can track his ipads and informed the customer service person we dont know their name they never gave it of this and that he had seen they were making their way back and forth across the north sea great they said we will contact the crew no further contact so on the wednesday the other half emailed them again asking if there had been any joy silence it took raising a complaint to hear anything further and this is where it gets interesting no sign of the backpack im afraid they tell us thats odd because we can see at least one of the ipads is still making its way back and forth perhaps they are no longer in the backpack apparently they checked again still no backpack or ipads now call me cynical but if a passenger had taken the backpackipads then they would be located elsewhere in the countryworld isnt it strange that there is apparently no sign of them yet appear to still be on the boat we have informed them we will be contacting the police to report them as stolen so we can make a claim on our insurance but perhaps we might drop the nugget to the police that they are still on that darned boat hmmmm
stena horizon i travelled times inj january last time jan and i was amazed at the high standards this crew and ship the awarness health and safety hygiene pleasant friendly caring and very professional i feel that somebody needs to reward this crew or at least say well done as stena holandica is way behind this crew in all aspects
i want to book a ticket on saturday evening with departure from halmstad to gren on sunday at the price i have to pay is dkk when i go to pay the price has increased to dkk i go back to see if i wrote wrong on the booking but everything is as it should be then go to payment again now the price has increased to dkk so in just five minutes the price has increased by a little dkk my son books at the same time on his mobile and pays less than minute before i want to pay and his price does not increase getting quite angry about this and waiting hour before i enter the order again now the price is dkk again i will have to pay as we want to be followed home from the holiday the next morning i just want to see how much the ticket costs and there i could get the same departure for just dkk i really feel that i have been cheated i have not complained anywhere as i know that you will not get anything out of it as there is bad customer service in stenaline i have experience from previous experience
i was denied access to the boat that was supposed to take me home to my native sweden my plan was to get a new passport on friday and then celebrate my th birthday with my family i have not been home for a long time and have not seen or spoken to my family i get to the boarding control and they see my danish id documents which are health cards and id cards i have been issued by aalborg municipality which have a picture and all my important information and i had my old swedish passport which unfortunately had expired as i couldnt come home and renew it because i couldnt find any available passports for several months it was exactly after the covid pandemic and everyone wanted to travel when i spoke to those in boarding control i explained my whole situation showed my id documents and wanted to show proof that i had an appointment to renew my passport at the swedish police in bors on but no they refused me they didnt want to see it although they can see that i am me and that i have legitimate reasons to come home i cry and shake and ask them for help but no and no one comes and asks if im okay afterwards when i sit and shake and cry and cry how can it be allowed to be like this i have lived in sweden all my life i am swedish i show id documents that prove that i am me how square can it be allowed to be the reason why i cant show a driving license instead of a passport is that i havent got a driving licence and the id document i have been issued by aalborg municipality is the only alternative i can get apart from a driving licence so what happens i am trapped in denmark thank you stena line for making me lose faith in people the hope that people dont just follow the rules of big companies i am completely blank and do not understand how you can be treated like this
we travelled on boat from liverpool to belfast on saturday th april our flights were cancelled we rebooked on boat and weather was awful which made it very unpleasent for me as im mot a good traveleri have to say the boat was beautiful clean and staff very friendly from the booking at the front door to the staff on the boat especialy katrina who went above and beyond for me will definatly be returning in better weather conditions hands of the captain also great job in bad weather conditions
going from belfast to cairnryan i booked online but i didnt notice it said cairnryan belfast went to check in and the girl said i had booked it the wrong way round she said its not a problem and she would fix it she charged me which i think is a disgrace i think stena line does this on purpose to try and catch people out not happy
when we were sightseeing in belfast and having a fantastic day we got a text from stena line to say they had a problem with a ferry and our return crossing pm was cancelled but we could go on the pm ferry we had travelled over on the am ferryalthough it was a hassle we could cope with that till we got another text saying this crossing was also cancelled now the ferry time was am please phone our helpline number or email if any queries the helpline is automated and no humans to speak to the email is hrs till they respond i think this is totally appalling what the hell do you do in a city you dont know as there is only so many hours you can sit in wetherspoons then they sent another text check in opens at pm so you can be squashed in s little room like cattle this is not how we should have been treated i think you need to up your game and sort this out how would you like it if it was you fortunately we went to the ferry port at pm my wife and i were exhausted and stressed to say the least a very kind lady on the reception allowed us to get on the ferry which just happen to be leaving mins later so thank you i am sorry but i didn t get your namewe got back to scotland about midnight but that was no thanks to the muppets who run the company the thought of having to walk around belfast was very unnerving for all the people who got the same texts we did stena line you should be ashamed to treat people like that as without customers you dont have a business
it started badly before our trip when i was unable to submit the application form because i was born before so my partner vicki who is younger had to drive my car on to the ferry i am only hardly elderly these days when we arrived at the ferry terminal in fishguard the operator was very efficient in texting me that due to adverse weather there would be a onehour delay this is unavoidable and so i am still giving genuine star for unavoidable delay with good handling and communication however a lengthy wait was not helped by the complete lack of refreshments at the ticket office despite delicious coffee being advertised drinks were dispensed from a basic catering machine which had broken down there was no alternative other than to walk off the waiting area to the local shopping parade where luckily the fish and chip shop provided great refreshments which should have been available as a given at the port once onboard and sailing and once the ships restaurant had finally opened i was told by a surly counter assistant that i was standing in the wrong place in the queue there was noone behind us when my partner asked if chips were included with the burgers she was told abruptly that they were as you can see from the customers plate in front of you i do not stare at other peoples food the coffee highlypriced for a paper cup of instant at euros tasted like dishwater and our burgers were revolting in fact the whole thing wouldve tasted better at mcdonalds and that is saying something the staff were equally surly when telling my partner vicki that there was no reading material magazines available in the shop furthermore when trying to embark at rosslare we asked another member of staff where the lift was as she has arthritic knees and has difficulty walking down stairs but not up again the answer was surly with the attempted indifference of a mere point and knowing right there comment and unengaged look we entered the lift alongside a young couple with a baby in a pram when the mother pressed the button the announcement stated that there was no travel to the ground floor so we all got out and vicki struggled down the stairs backwards holding up other passengers returning to the subject of your age discriminatory boarding policy while waiting to board the ship during the necessary and understandable delay at fishguard i got chatting to the driver next to me he told me he was and you might also be interested to know that the driver on the other side of us who was transporting his teenaged children was returning to his car at this point having collected a large amount of alcohol from the dutyfree shop his probably about yearold daughter was carrying a bottle of wine then he himself drank some ale from a can and when the ferry arrived got into the driving seat and boarded the ferry it seems you allow drinking drunk drivers on to the ship but not sober and healthy newlyretired ones i refer here to our departure on th september a week later our return sailing from eire on the rd was not much better staff were marginally more polite but the coffee again was revolting and this time we brought our own food i have sailed many times over the last few decades but never with stenna line and never again
we sent an email to the stena line after our last trip we really dont need any compensation but wanted to share our experience with the stena line the answer is far from satisfactory as a company you could start with quothow annoyingquot or something like that but unfortunately no such comment below is the text of our email and below it the answer dear last christmas we went to visit my son and his family in sweden and used the stena line we have been doing this for years and there have been some minor issues but they have always been resolved neatly the last journey there and back was very sad apart from the increasingly expensive bookings we are very shocked by the condition of the cabins nowadays we book an inside cabin because you can see little to nothing through the windows because it is dark we imagined ourselves in the ambiance of an old ocean liner it was all so shabby and dated isnt even the right choice of words in this it was old broken and damaged and it seemed like stena didnt want to spend another euro on it we really dont think we are booking on a luxury cruise or something like that but this was very bad a small example the sink in the hut hardly drained and therefore we did not even dare to take a shower we really did not feel comfortable on the boat and if the maintenance of the cabins also affects the maintenance of safety on the boat we are very concerned we have already booked for the may holiday but we dont really have a good feeling about it the feeling is the motivation that i now want to report this to stena i hope you can take away this feeling otherwise i think we would rather travel to sweden via the bridges instead of by boat kind regards marianne and ido bormann then the answer good morning thank you for your message we will forward your feedback about the cabin to our ships on this route our advice is always if you have a complaint regarding a booked cabin to report this immediately to the guest service desk on board so that they could have helped you immediately by checking the cabin and possibly offering you another cabin if they cannot offer you an alternative they will submit a refund request to us unfortunately afterwards we cannot do anything for you in this regard our ships go to dock every year for maintenance and inspections and comply with all safety regulations alissa van drongelen customer service center answer dear alissa thank you for the answer although it is very unsatisfactory its very easy to dismiss it if you havent complained on board so figure it out so you clearly have no idea what weve gotten ourselves into we now know that we have to find an alternative to get to our son in sweden the stena is then no longer an option for us thank you and have a nice day greetings ido neither language nor sign any more from the stena line i think stena has lost another customer in this way and that for more than euros for the crossing
the detail of this review is already a complaint to stena crm which they have refused to answer or formally acknowledge my wife and i travelled on this service on the st of august and again because we could not believe it could be so bad the second time on the th of august see rest of the review for the second trip we were totally appalled and extremely disappointed by the cabin selections and level of service available on the new ship you operate between fishagaurd and rosslare before i made my last booking i phoned stena office to confirm that there was a superior cabin available that offered teacoffee making facilities and was informed that the birth superior cabin had all i wanted and specifically the teacoffee making facilities on boarding the ferry it immediately became obvious that this was a figment of the stena reservation clerks imagination and it totally misrepresented the product stena are selling and contravened the trades description act i complained to the staff on board and their attitude was take it or leave it the cabin we were in was also substandard the bathroom stank and the bed mattress was also useless i would have been better off lying on the floor but there was insufficient room and what about privacy glass there is none in the window which looks out over the deck which passengers have access to we visited the stena plus lounge and again yes looks pretty but functionally useless the choices of snacks were totally unacceptable and the coffee and teamaking facilities did not work properly having survived that terrible experience we decided to wait before making any complaint until we returned on the ferry from fishguard at on the th and this was even worse now we are in one of these superior cabins and in a section that is used by those with dogs i have nothing against dogs but when they keep you awake all night barking it goes way past a joke my wife and i are in our s and need the rest as we have a hour drive to the other end of the ferry trip with no chance of that on this trip a total nightmare your changes to the cabin policy for pet owners may be good for them but totally unacceptable to the majority of nonpet travelling owners i would seriously suggest and the second cabin has no carpet i assume for pets who cant wait not a pleasant thought that you may be walking around in a space that some dog has used as a toilet and still no privacy glass in the windows and no teacoffee making facilities and yes the stena plus lounge with the same boring selection of snacks etc and i noted that you will never offer hot snacks on this new ship is this progress you are obviously not interested in customer service or customer satisfaction and what about the sailing times on this service normally its hours and you use this as a positive point of difference in the marketing blurb so why hours for this early sailing and then when we finally docked it was a further mins before we were allowed off the ferry so that was a hour delay in total and for what exactly and no attempt was made to apologise for the delay so i have to assume a delay is a known event and do you advertise that no finally this new vessel for this route appears to be much smaller than comparable vessels providing similar service across the irish sea therefore i would imagine will become more susceptible to cancellations during periods of bad weather but i am not an expert
i have to admit that i have always been fairly satisfied with you and i can see that you have already lost your grip as you are just happy with the bad reviews you get after all you only get star from me because i get locked up on your car tires on jutlandica in a truck between other trucks and couldnt get out so its a bit difficult when youre not allowed to stay in the truck during sailing but your conductor didnt seem to care and later your guard comes and forces me out of the truck saw the door of the truck being scratched against a trailer as the guard said thats just how it is and my arm was also scratched and a dirty tshirt so i dont know if it should be reported to the police or if you can answer that is the way you are treated on board know you and have documentation of it
way over priced for familys sailing cairnryan to belfast was always a fun day out to belfast zoo the fun starting on the boat to belfast no way could afford it now so sad
i travel between the ukie fairly regularly i had used irish ferries quite a bit but after trying stena particularly the estrid i switched as it is very pet friendly with the on deck kennels you can access any time however i was on the nordica this week and couldnt have had more of an opposite experience the kennels are on the car deck out in the open no locks for the kennels no access to water and you cant check on them during the journey the fact they are just on the car deck itself doesnt seem very safe if something were to roll a number of us who had brought pets all found it substandard unless the estrid is available i will likely avoid in the future
good things we didnt make another titanic bad things one and a half hours before arrival they woke us up on a radio in the wall with a mins song and then some fukcing captain telling us breakfest is readyhe did this in languages i then tried to fall asleep again but it was literslly impossible bcs of the sounds ferrys propellers shaking people walking talking screaming someting vibrating constantly bcs if the ferry shaking radio turned on again fs
i would like to write an amazing review for all the staff at stena ferry line on saturday st july at belfast to uk at clair smith acted friendly and polite as we collected our meals later on i personally scolded myself with a hot chocolate very badly luckily as a biker i had protective trousers on that protected my legs her quick actions lead to applying cool cloths while the burn kit was located the burn jell was applied to my very sensitive stomach and done in a dignified way a week later i have a very very small red line it could of be hospitalisation without her quick thinking this was the ferry that ended in a man taking his life due of this understandably we had to be counted and police investigating to make sure the safety of everyone was insured and no one acted in the death of a man during this the staff were brilliant they were forceful enough to insure everyone would sit to be counted in an emergency while in the ladies toilets later on after head checks were completed i overheard clair reassure distressed people cuddle dogs hand out water and later on biscuits i would love nothing more to find this lady and thank her for extra attention and passion for the job it was a day that got complicated real fast towards the end but you didnt see any of the difficulty the crew had faces thank you
from the stenaline staff on land to the stenaline staff at sea they made what seemed to be the impossible possible i can not show this crew enough gratitude for going more than above and beyond to make this sailing possible for me with delays beyond my control in a place i am not used to i could count on stenaline and will be forever grateful for their consistency and tolerance i personally would not and will not sail with any other absolute legends lads thank you times a million
a group of bikers from warwickshire and solihull blood bikes were undertaking a charity ride to raise funds for a new motorcycle our ferry was delayed but morgan in the dublin port office sorted us out couldnt have completed our trip without her help proper customer service
i cant give no stars hour delay in total on crossingsdumped in holyhead at am no hotel no help nothing people are treated like cattle no apology no interest no service i think this is the worst customer service experience i have ever had also witnessed an assault on a disabled boy and staff did very little to help abh does not matter to stena avoid a shambles they just dont care
i have booked a double cabin and have been charged for the booking twice stenaline refused reimbursement for the cabin i did not book but was charged for the customer service was awfully unresponsive and contradicted was i was advised whilst on the ferry it was the most terrible and shameful experience i had in a long while
chaotic booking and travel experience you have to read a long blurb of instructions to find out the dog needs to be added under vouchers apparently i am far from alone in failing this process according to the lady at the checkin the result is your dog stays for hours in the car it seems stenaline has little duty of care for your dog as it is not allowed on any of the decks despite taking payment we were probably naive to assume dogs would be allowed on the outside decks once you get on the ferry there is little signposting we were on the stairs with a lady that struggled to make it not realising we already had left the car decks behind no signs where the stairs are or at which level once you are inside stairwell prices are not displayed but its for english breakfast tea in case you are interested to know harwich hook of holland on the britanica
excellent experience today with stenaline customer service the lady who took my booking for a return trip to ireland was exceptional and really did walk that extra mile when taking my booking i tried to book irish ferries but the very rude man with whom i spoke to tried to scam an extra from me on there website with my dates said but then i phoned up he wanted to charge so i went with stenaline who charged me the same price as on the websitethank you stena
we broke down in our motorhome in holyhead port having come back from ireland and were there for hours due to the ineptitude of our breakdown company the staff at the port could not have done more for us they were the only reason we managed to stay sane i would like to say a very big thank you to everyone who took care of us and helped us to deal with a difficult situation what stars
i travelled back at the end of may when delays happened i get that this was not their fault i asked for assistance as i would be kissing all my connections stranded and the people on the boat were very helpful but i was told any extra cost would be covered by stenaline so if i went to a b b then travelled by train back home the best day an extra cost of for stena to then refuse refund go back on there word was st time travelling certainly the last
extremely uncompassionate customer service we booked a return trip my husband is my carer so travels for free which can only be booked by talking to an actual person well where do i start lovely to deal with when youre lining their pockets with cash but a disgrace when not sadly we had a death in family and cant travel we rang explained the manager said we booked economy emm yes because we were offered nothing else refused to refund or exchange travel dates were over down an absolute disgrace i hope your never dealt the same experience as us but im a big believer in karma
we would like to report on our very positive experience with the stena line horizon cherbourgrosslare the entire team was extremely attentive very friendly and hardworking on our return journey the only option for us was to sleep in a recliner for the night as all the cabins were occupied but we were able to cope with that quite well one very notable thing free coffee tea and hot chocolate in the relaxation lounge thank you very much and next time well be using stena line again
ridiculously long wait to board at harwich we were told check in was and then boarding would be at we are still waiting to board at while watching lorries still being unloaded no announcements no idea how long we have to wait nowhere to buy food we have paid for an expensive cabin and a meal in advance we will be lucky if we get more than five hours sleep we will definitely go by tunnel next time
a terrible experience i booked a return ticket with stena l clearly stated that vehicle was a renault traffic van under metres in length and less than metres high cost e when i arrive at belfast checkin for trip to scotland l was told price was for a car had to pay extra e and they are now calling van a transit van which is made by ford i dont know how a company that transport vehicles dont know difference between renault and ford i was able to travel by cal mac to the outer islands about the same distance for pounds because vans under meter is priced same as car because they take up same amount of room and the food they serve is far beyond the overpriced crap you get on stena it was my first time using stena and last over the years i always used p and o and that is who i will be going back to
i am so utterly grateful to ricky the operations manager of stena lines in belfast after having had my flight cancelled ricky went above and beyond to help me board the ferry despite my very late arrival and strict operational requirements so i could make it back to my children in london his kindness and professionalism really made my day a huge thank you a warm thank you also to kirsty working on the ferry who with her very calm and positive demeanour helped me and another irish lady off the ferry overall such a warm and pleasant experience with stena line
cant get the hell out of a boat
i always use stena line best carrier on the irish sea
i have been using stena as a foot passenger for about years and i think they are great fabulous customer service and great with supporting travellers with dogs and the ship belfast to cairnryan almost always on time recently needed to change dates for an imminent trip to france and was pleasantly surprised to discover it would only be e extra to switch the date this the day before the sailing
i went on the holyhead to dublin ferry what a wonderful experience all the staff were polite helpful and professional nothing was too much trouble the gentleman working in guest services was extremely helpful and informative
i have travelled with stena line on the kielgothenburgkiel route twice the first time there was no other option than to pay another booking fee collecting the papers when boarding went well i was given an inside cabin that was set up for two people so far everything was fine except that the cabin hadnt been cleaned for a long time there was fluff and dirt on the floor which really needed to be vacuumed and all the dust behind the lamp which hadnt been cleaned for a very long time what a pity the trip itself is very pleasant you can take part in events on board and there are announcements for this on the return trip you keep the same cabin which isnt cleaned then either the second time it was even worse i was given a cabin where the toilet stank so much it was almost unbearable that shouldnt be happening nothing was done on this trip either the three stars are for the crossing which is otherwise very pleasant the time in gothenburg is enough to look around there was also an option to book a day ticket but something urgently needs to be done about the cabins
booking cancelled by stena line the day before the trip due to a technical problem which can happen when we called the number provided we were promised to rebook with irish ferries and to call to let us know if it worked we only received a new email with the information that we had been rebooked but without any departure times dates or booking details after we didnt receive a call back we called again and were told that we now had to contact irish ferries unfortunately this was not the first time we had bad experiences with stena line conclusion there are other ferries
having purchased a so called flexi ticket from cairnryan belfast i was perturbed to learn that should you wish to amend the flexi ticket charges are levied for the privilege the stena webpage certainly states these amendment charges however theyre not very transparent unless youre familiar with their webpage flexi tickets are more expensive than economy tickets which as far as im concerned incorporates the extra charge what is the point purchasing flexi tickets when one can book single trips and if need be travel with a rival company for the return trip should the need arise thus saving all stena lines admin charges which basically is profiteering especially when other ferry companies can offer a longer sailing journey with a car at half the price stena line charge ill certainly not be caught out with this nonsense again especially as po do not levy such amendment charges
taking the ferry should actually be a nice start or end to a vacation i dont want to say anything negative about the ship but the food is catastrophic they offered hot dogs i ordered two a plate was put down and then two untoasted cold rolls were put on the plate straight from a plastic bag then two lukewarm sausages were put on top a bowl with a few fried onions was pushed towards me and i was shown a bottle of ketchup and a bottle of mustard well bon appetit i thought to myself it tastes awful
arrived on a saturday morning for a ferry from dublin to holyhead and had beeked the jrurney the wrong way round absolute legend ciaran helped me out and pulled out all the stops to get me on the ferry absolute gentleman saved my trip and my ass thanks
i am completely disappointedthey dont given exactly adressyou have no chance for next ferry the same daygps show office buildingno one nothing known where you should goi arrived becouse minuttes i was looking for where it is and they said the gate is closed next ferry tomorrow if you again buy ticketi was travel on my wedding daydoesnt matternever again
boarding process at belfast is a joke arrive early and you will wait longer to board arrive late and youll get on first really liverpool on the other hand is completely the opposite an explanation of why this happens would be helpful
return journey change very complicated money is charged for changes when ordering no telephone advice
we frequently travel belfast to liverpool belfast have now implemented a boarding process that means the first cars to arrive at the port hour wait are now the last to board it is a shambles and very unfair returning from liverpool is so much better organised
it been over years since i was last on a ferry and obviously things have changed i was on the holyheaddublin route the whole process and journey was a pleasure admittedly the weather was calm the drivein check in was simplicity itself a short wait and we were allowed to drive our car on no fuss and super quick we opted for the hygge lounge for each which was good with reclined chairs and free coffeesteas free wifi and a large screen tv next time i think we would go for the club lounge for per person which offers space and free food and drink other than that the facilities were excellent with mini cinemas showing films duty free good catering and lots of space to move around will definitely be using them again
took the ferry for the first time took the train to trelleborg and then to the foot passenger terminal in the expectation that checkin would take place there but there was nothing there the counter was closed just the information on the screen that you would be picked up by the bus minutes before departure and that you had to check in minutes before departure it was very confusing and i was afraid that i would be faced with some bureaucratic process as a foot passenger you just need to be in the terminal building on time but i imagine checkin to be something completely different there was quite a gap between the theoretical process and the practical part i could have easily gone to a restaurant in between the food on the ship was more or less ok i was then able to sleep quite well in the cabin considering the circumstances but on the way back there was more confusion because the bus drove straight onto the ferry in trelleborg but in rostock you were not picked up by a bus on deck you had to walk out first past all the cars if you know how its done it would have been pretty good as it was it was pretty kafkaesque and a lot of unnecessary stress i can still imagine doing it again now that ive had the experience oh yes according to the stena hotline the booking email should contain a contact number for the port staff but there wasnt one and when i entered the number for the port of trelleborg in google i ended up somewhere in the black forest
i spoke with aggie in customer services she was charming informative helpful it was a very pleasant experience chatting with her she spoke calmly and clearly and listened to my worry about my booking in the end she sorted out my problem and left me feeling at ease please convey my personal thanks to her im looking forward to my next sailing with stenaline simply the best crossing experience linda dukes
round trip cherbourg rosslare in march going very well onboard staff very attentive return more than h waiting at rosslare without information due to loading of cattle trucks containing calves from all over the world ireland smell of manure throughout the trip problem reported to the company which was to make a commercial gesture still pending to this day
i have to collect my mother from hospital in belfast following a fall staff from liverpool and the staff in belfast were outstanding on both journeys they really could not have done more for us and certainly saved my sanity especially when we were struggling to get back to the port due to access to wheelchair taxis amazing service the very best staff and some awesome singing from the chap behind the counter in liverpool special thanks also for the chap who helped us on and off the shuttle bus
i have used several crossings myself especially hoek van holland harwich is my favorite connection stena line is one of my favorite ferry companies no fuss just comfort and the connections i have had are often excellent for train travelers in trelleborg kiel hoek van holland and harwich you have the train or metro around the corner and in other places there is good public transport to the train the advantage of the night connection between hoek van holland and harwich is that you save money on a hotel and you can often book a train ticket with your ferry make sure you book this correctly
travelled on stena nordica yesterday from cairnryan to belfast what a shambles stairs very steep narrow hygge lounge had no foot support on seats making them very uncomfortable also door didnt close properly so anyone could enter without code disembarkation was a covid hot spot people queued in narrow corridors for ages while trying to get to the car deck no supervision whatsoever if this was a refurbished ship i dread to think what it was originally like this is an expensive enough crossing without giving people second rate service accommodation dont think ill be using it again until they bring back the superfast ferry
on check in at cairnryan the lady informed us that there had been an incident in belfast which had delayed the ferry from docking she advised our ferry would be delayed by minutes as it turned out it was delayed by over an hour the ferry was not the usual superfast we normally see on the belfastcairnryan route but the stena nordica the stenaplus was much more compact but still provided the same quality of snacks etc as usual staff were efficient and as friendly as ever despite the complaints from annoyed passengers who were unhappy that this was not their expected ferry it turns out the superfast is in dry dock having a refit and will return in weeks with a larger and improved stenaplus we docked in belfast after pm we found ourselves right at the front first to disembark however we watched as staff struggled with the ramp for approx minutes in full view of the car deck trying to get the ramp to connect properly with the deck to allow cars to drive over it safely my review is to commend all staff on what must have been a frustrating shift for them tonight we always travel with stena line and have always found all their employees to be polite helpful and professional tonight confirmed this once again thank you
my return journey from belfast was smooth and enjoyable the staff were very pleasant and helpful i travelled in stena plus i have to say that the gents toilet facilities were disgusting the toilet was blocked and the flushing system was defective non functional i had to use the facilities in economy class and they were even more disgusting i have traveled with stena line for many years this is my first complaint
car damage in ferry i picked up a new car from a portadown mini dealership full pre delivery inspection carried out drove from portadown to belfast port car never out of my sight parked on car deck and went to lounge on return got in car and drove home again car never out of my sight at home noticed a big gouge in the drivers wing mirror this could only have been done on car deck and not by a passenger with a bag etc emailed stena customer services julie sisi who came back with a reply basically saying that it couldnt have been stena and accepting no liability the tone of the reply was basically to protect stena from any cost foremost and implying that i was lying as i had not noticed the damage and reported it prior to disembarkation the view was it couldnt have been stena so if you do choose to use this company photograph your car before and after although from other reviews even then stena will not accept any liability my experience is that this is a company who put the customer last maybe they will eventually work out who pays them or maybe not i will not use them again customer experience is everything get on board stena
we travelled last weekend tofrom cairnryan belfast service was great on time and reliable we were particularly impressed when we saw two of the sailors who where directing the loading of cars taking time to help an elderly lady out of her car and up to the passenger deck very well done
we recently travelled back to liverpool on the embla ferry from belfast march th we chose to go in the stena plus lounge as it was hrs in the daytime brilliant decision as we were looked after really well comfortable able to work and offered all kinds of beverages and snacks special megathanks to the man in charge so sorry we didnt get his name who came looking for us on the car deck just before driving off brought us our forgotten power charger absolute hero
stena line frederikshavn now you cant drive down to the terminal and park nor to unload people i was there on sunday march drove against the direction of travel but the terminal was locked quotaccess only for personnelquot so up the access road here there is access to the long walkway probably around mtr my swedish roommate just got a new knee and im waiting to have an operation on my hip so how are we going to get out there if there was a tape like at kastrup airport its simple and bad shame on you stena
the trip from holyhead to dublin was great then it went diwnhill no taxis outside the departure lounge so ended up having to order an uber user came and proceeded to go the wrong way and ended up on the wrong motorway slip road and decided to reverse back down the sliproad so dangerous and illegal driver then continued to charge us even though he went the wrong way finally did get to hotel ok and had great weekend in dublin however the trip back today has so far not been great we were told we could have priority check in mins before but didnt get that when we did finally get to the stena plus lounge after everyone else we were left with an option to sit on a fairly uncomfortable sofa sat opposite a older woman and her son who decided to take the whole corner section of chairs for the of them they told us seats were taken staff should not allow this to happen the elderly woman then proceeded to play her phone at full volume while scrolling through her apps now son is talking very loudly drinking beer not impressed as was hoping for another relaxing journey but alas not
trelleborgrostock the personnel forced us to pay for the return trip at the check in even though this was already paid during the online booking their system is bad had an error and we had to pay twice they informed us that we can always claim the money back after returning home we claimed the money back and they still dont want to pay the full amount that they charged wrongly as they cannot count and use proper exchange rates extremely incompetent personnel never go on stena line quality is also catastrophic never again they cancel trips with one days notice due to strong winds even though the other ferrys work bunch of frauds
left home this am for sailing from belfast to cairnryan half way there told sailing was cancelled due to tech difficulties booked on to sailing which was pushed bach hours for sailing approaching cairnryan now birthing at instead of due to more technical difficulties not a good service for the price gift vouchers dot cut it we just want to enjoy our holiday
i lost my hat while in the car queue to get on the belfast to liverpool ferry told one of the staff on the boat and got a call the following day saying they had found it i was pretty slack about sending them a return envelope had to be done due to covid rules but eventually got round to it last week the staff in the office kept it safe and sent it back to me immediately thanks very much stena staff
we traveled on the stena horizon from cherbourg to rosslare in thirty years of ferry experience we have never experienced such a wonderful crew as on the horizon all the staff were overwhelmingly friendly and attentive it was a great experience and we as somewhat more mature people really enjoyed it thank you for that
profit before people booked priority boarding parked my van first in the que and went upstairs came back down and i had a flat tyre caused by a nail onboard i notified their staff but i was swore at and blamed for holding everyone up incidentally when i was on board i was served fresh cream instead of mayo on my burger and chips well what was fresh cream at one point days earlier it was just not so fresh cream i was ill the rest of the trip i notified their customer services and sent proof of the tyre being damaged and replaced but they refused to pay anything and said they would as a gesture of good will discount a future trip i asked what was the value and they said nothing and would i accept again i asked for value and their sales staff member julie sisi said it would be and reminded me that i had no rights to get anything fixed or covered i raised the complaint to her manager on occasions but was ignored despite being promised a call back absolutely useless and ignorant
as always great staff ships and experience unfortunately the booking procedure is a blooy joke when entering the passenger birth date you are expected no have to press hundreds of times to enter the correct date a multi million company with a it monkey problem
warning do not buy tickets for the new boats between karlskrona and gdynia the ferries are great but they have quotforgottenquot to build boarding ramps for walking passengers now you have to wait for hours for a bus to quotridequot the ferry via a car tire its been like this since september last year and nothing has happened and no one knows when stena line will get their thumb out do not pay full price for this mess
just experienced stena lines profit before people policy arrived at harwich for the ferry to hook of holland let me be clear first my ticket was for the next morning so it was my mistake to arrive early i always travel stena and forgot i booked a day ticket explained to the ticket man he said i could get on no problem i was very happy to hear this but i would have to pay explained i didnt have that kind of money and otherwise would have to sleep in the van its february and cold to which he replied theres a hotel up the road hotel not available i have been travelling stena for years ireland france holland but this shocked me he could used his disgretion and let me on very disappointed with stena as the dutch would say de klant is niet altijd koning
rickie was so welcoming on the adventurer him and his team made our day we have not used the ferry before today but the hosting we received will now have us regular visitors we were made feel so important ricky is a genuine nice guy and credit to the company great day out thanks richard really appreciated it from steven and sharon
this company is a rip off for the same datestimes of travel the price using of clubcard boost was more expensive than booking without clubcard boost shame on you i will never travel with stena
traveled few times over the years and the over the years it has changed for worse than improve the first movie they played in cinema started already before the ferry sailed away so most passengers like myself couldnt watch it they used to have entertainer for kids which they stopped now and no board games anymore
i booked on line passengers and car liverpool to belfast return for my sons wedding however i made an error in the booking and also discovered i was entitled to discount i called the help desk number and the wonderful staff emily reviewed my booking and applied the discount even though i had already booked i can only say to get this level of customer service and understanding doesnt happen with many companies nowadays i cannot thank emily and stena line enough for being an understanding flexible company and refunding me the difference stena will now always be my chosen ferry operator my sincere best wishes to all your wonderful staff they even called to follow up my request well done stenaline
stena line have got my back when it comes to customer service this was the second year in succession that we have used this great company for our christmas and new years visit to the grandchildren in ireland last year they organised a last minute crossing due to being let down by a well known irish airline company and this year when our booked crossing from fishguard was cancelled due to weather conditions the staff at stena were trouble free and accommodating to a tee different departure location and trouble free boarding a relaxing lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks made the journey effortless and so easy thank you stena line you are truly a reliable company with great customer service see you later in the year
i had booked stena ferries holyhead dublin and return for june with the booking i included the fee for cancellations or change of booking unfortunately i had to cancel my bookings for june easy process no questions asked and refunded two days after thank you stena line for making this process completely stress free
i traveled to gothenburg on december th with stena line the trip to gothenburg was nice but then because it was raining i wanted to go to my cabin after hours but we were denied entry only from pm which is impossible because we were completely drunk then i urgently wanted to go to the toilet but we were denied entry until pm i think thats not possible every need must be allowed maybe something could be changed about that waiting wet for hours and then not even being able to go to the toilet is outrageous frauke lttjohann
in the booking confirmation stenaline provides two contact options for queries the ferry center in rostock and the telephone number the trip to the ferry center was in vain the employee there refused to help because he quothad no ideaquot original quote the service number played the announcement quotyou will be connected to the next available employeequot for an hour and minutes service couldnt be worse its a shame there are no negative stars
travelled from belfast dec nd the ferry was spotless and staff friendly plenty of room and no trouble getting seats we got some chips to fill the time and sadly they were the worst chips ive ever eaten luke warm dry and felt like we were eating flour so glad we didnt buy a full meal plus a bit pricey cant complain about anything else the crossing was great
i sailed dublin to hollyhead on the stena adventurer on nd december and i have to say i met the nicest staff ever from the staff checking me in at the desk to the ones leading us to the bus on our departure from the ship they were smiling and friendly and very approachable i was in the stena plus lounge on the way over and hygge lounge on the way back and had fab views from the front of the ship on both food was lovely and staff very helpful and professional i would like to give a special thanks to a staff member daniel who was so friendly from when i met him on the door in the plus lounge to meeting him later in the duty free i was delighted to see him working again on my return journey as he was just as helpful on the way home the two ladies working on the coffee bar on return trip on the th were lovely and chatty and had time for all customers well done stena line beautiful clean ship efficient service and friendly professional staff i will definately recommend your company and looking forward to sailing with you again
i recently travelled dublin to holyhead to collect my new rescue dog to say this trip was pleasant is an understatement clean spacious and also impressed with the size of the kennels i didnt book a kennel thinking they were too small but was given one last minute to try then there was the lovely brittany this lady was so helpful i got lost finding the kennels and she was so patient with me and took us straight there my dog was very nervous and i was very flustered but she helped me so much to get him settled she was a true star i would highly recommend the dublin to holyhead stena estrid ill be booking again soon thanks again
after the well documented troubles with my previous favourite ferry company p i thought id give stena harwich to holland a try very good indeed a much nicer more modern ship with better cabins than po hull ferry even a television free minibar and snacks in the premier cabin restaurant and bar were excellent and not over priced only stars as the loading was a bit chaotic late and the car deck crew were rather surly and seemingly disinterested otherwise a good ferry and i will use them again
i recently travelled on stena line ferry on the th at pm from liverpool to belfast firstly id like to exspress how distraught i am after the experience i endured by the staff ive never felt more unfairly mistreated then i did on the th of november i book the ferry for myself my vehicle wife caravan now i book the caravan as meteres on the side of my caravan its say its is m but when i pulled up at the docks there was about gypsytravelers there with their caravans and clearly cause i pulled up with the caravan they classed me as the same now that is discrimination at first class they looked at me and saw i also had a caravan not knowing that i am a caravan dealer my business name is curragh caravans you can look that up to verify so when it was my turn the women spoke to me with the most rudest attitude she got out and measured my caravan to hitch n said it was meters and she told me i could not get on the ferry i had to go back n rebook so when i went to rebook the extra amount of they refused to take card only wanted cash payment now clearly this was for their own pocket as they did not update my ticket to state that i had payed the extra they also done this with all the gyspy traveller ppl so clearly they have pocket all this money for their own gain then they went on to lock us all in a compound for over minutes they only done this with the gyspytravelling ppl and myself and thats not the worst part when we got on the ferry they closed all the bars at pm because of travelling community and classing me as the same the staff onboard spoke to me and my wife in the most rudest manor talking down on us like they were better then us ive never witnessed anything in my life like it i am a gold membership and frequently travel with stenaline and have never been so unfairly treated i also book a cabin and since i was not welcome around the ship i went to go get sleep but due to children running up and down i was awake for the full night long but i cant exspress enough about the horrible staff on the th of november its is appalling how we were treated ive try emailing since monday and no body from stena line has the decency to respond clearly they do not care and think the behaviour is acceptable
sailed twice with stenaline from rosslare to cherbourg last year and the ship and crew were fantastic really made our trip sailed with stena on the horizon for my trip home from france this year and it was not a patch on last year first off they were going to strap my motorbike down with no protection on the seat until i kicked up a fuss the manager or higher up sorted out some good protection customer service was not great the staff seemed a little on edge the food selection was not great
was on the boat from belfast to cairnryan had my dog cockapoo months in a dog friendly area in a carrier case dog needed to pee so we took him out on the deck as he has peed there before then a blonde woman around age followed my girlfriend telling her to come back as he cant pee outside i decided to go find the woman and customer service and speak to her myself where she proceeded to say that the dog cant pee outside and he should be doing his business in the carrier create and it is our job to clean it if we allowed him to do it in the carrier he would be filthy as that is where he has to stay and that other passengers will complain due to smell needs to learn that dogs dont have legs like us and dont have their own area to pee so an outside area is fine wether its in your terms it should be changed shocking
i have just had the most amazing trip on the stena edda liverpool to belfast return the crew were fantastic diane from the coffee shop very welcoming the nice lithuania lady from duty free shop sorry i didnt get your name she knew her stuff all about the perfumes and we definitely had a bargain meals were fabulous in the restaurant we were looked after by kirsty and jamie they were lovely they went out of there way to make our journey enjoyable we felt really looked after us jamie got us information on where to visit in belfasttaxi numbers and a map of the streets on the return we saw them all again and the service was out of world stena should be proud of there crew id like to say thank you especially jamie and kirsty
please turn your phone onto airplane mode before you get on the vessel or you will suffer egregious phone charges even if you never make any calls the company has done a deal with a satellite service provider called mcp which your phone will latch onto and if you dont happen to see a message which comes to your phone and turn it off will start to access the network and you will end up with a hefty bill so if you leave your phone in your bag as i did the first time you will know is when you next look at it and see a plus charge no announcement was made on the ship telling people to turn off their phones contrary to what they said when i complained and they only played an announcement when i went up and told them to on my return trip they also say that there is information on screens but these scroll across a number of messages so you would have to be looking at the right time i believe that having a service like this that does not require an opt in step may be illegal so am pursuing all routes to get this shut down if you are on board and have the same issue please complain otherwise the trip was ok cabin clean decor isn the ship modern but a mish mash of pretty tasteless design but that doesnt matter when you are asleep
the harwich crossing was basically ok this review is to warn readers to switch their phones to flight mode on boarding there are warnings about roaming charges but most people will think that if they dont use their phone they will be ok never touched mine and incurred a roaming fee i have asked them to make a ship wide announcement and i heard one all the same stena should do more to protect busy and tired people from excess charges i suppose they must make money from the charges mike
booked at short notice to return from dublin to holyhead after my irish ferries booking was cancelled due to adverse weather price was equivalent to the cancelled booking easy to contact by phone kept informed with sailing updates lovely comfortable modern craft with very friendly crew fellow passenger used their new on board dog kennels and said they were good with access to check on them during the voyage i would certainly use them in the future for that reason alone i particularly want to highlight the help for passengers who need assistance this was offered to me without me having to ask and was also offered to lone parents travelling with small children and pushchairs luggage the crew gave priority boarding on the shuttle bus to anyone needing assistance thank you
ruthless company i turned up to belfast port going to liverpool at pm for the sailing i was told we close at even tho it was clearly visible threw the fence that cars were still driving onto the ferry i paid for this crossing i was told the only thing i could do was to get the cairnryan ferry to scotland that left me with a mile trip on the other side when i checked the price of the ferry i got to cairnryan it was so i decided to ask if i could get a meal voucher or a cabin to cover the balance i was told no ill be sailing with po in the future
traveling with a dog is a disaster dogs are only allowed in one corner of the ferry which is neither on the same deck nor within sight of where you can buy a cappuccino or snack contrary to the advertisement wifi is available which perhaps justifies the one star the small corner for pets is also being used diligently by other passengers so that some dog owners have not found a place the competition from sweden to rostock and from sassnitz to ystad is worlds better never again ferry totally overheated
ferry cherbourgrosslare and back both ferry trips were very nice great clean cabins we were particularly pleased with the extremely friendly staff on both ferry trips we would be happy to go again
im travelling from liverpool to nireland belfast and ive been absolutely disgusted how i have been treated my mother of years of age has been talked to in a unhuman way it is currently we are booked in stena line plus and have been thrown out because we apparently was sneaking swapping people in the lounge my mother comes every month two months back and forth to nireland for a man with a disgusted attitude to tell us that hes going to throw us off the boat for something we havent done ive just witnessed him at the desk arguing with another man that i do not know saying that he was the power to throw him off the boat and that he will make sure you will never sail with us again because i dont like how your talking to me the guy was only making a complaint about the people next to him being very loud we also asked for a manager he said he was a manger apparently who is he to tell anyone that he will remove them off the boat when he has approached us with a attitude me and multiple people he refused to give hes name but i am determined to get it after being thrown out for false information we was also declined a refund of we have minors with us and they felt very scared and threatened by him i also feel very threatened by him im disgusted he is a bald male scottish accent the lady at the stena line plus lounge that was at the desk was also very rude to call him in the first place when we have paid
sailing from fishgaurd to roslare right this very moment and the ferry is absolutely freezing very rude man on the reception desk when i complained about how cold it was was not interested at all would recomend bringing a blanket on your trip or you will freeze wont be travelling with stenna anymore
attention disabledunfriendly due to a defective gangway all pedestrians in kiel had to leave the ship via the loading hatch between cars rvs trucks etc including old sick and severely disabled passengers without any help from the staff no one is responsible everyone looks away no one helps catastrophic and inhumane trip gothenburgkiel arrival august
i inadvertently booked a ferry crossing with the wrong date and did not realise until after the crossing had taken place i subsequently rebooked the crossing for the correct date and presumed i would have to put it down to a very costly lesson however when we spoke to stenaline about it they authorised a full refund of the initial booking fees absolutely thrilled and amazed thank you stena
a shout out to the very helpful staff on the phone in liverpool especially jordanfemale who sorted change of sailing from liverpool to belfast for the next one on friday th september and added a note to system for port staff to see the problem my family member who was travelling was in thank you to tricia at the port who called me to offer free entry to stena plus lounge after she heard the problem very reassuring for me thank you stenaline of us in my family sail often and always have a positive experience using stenaline and staff have always been very pleasant and friendly
booking ref cairnryan to belfast so far as the ship stena superfast viii was concerned stars woefully i could not say the same about my visit to the terminal in cairnryan at i called to enquire if any cancellations had been made on the sailing the gent who came clearly was annoyed at having had his hour tea break interrupted he must be a super employee as he had no need to check the website for the latest state of play his answer full up no space this may well have been the case but some action to at least show some interest would have been welcome i would not tolerate an employee of mine acting in such a manner clearly a case for retraining
we had booked a crossing with stena line in the end we were not allowed to come because the dog could not spend the night in the car and we had not booked a quotpet cabinquot very rude customer service who did not want a refund very unclear booking conditions at stena line
travelled to dublin from hollyhead in august my disabled daughter became very ill the staff in dublin and on the ferry were fantastic and helped enormously particularly paul
worst company ever booked with the company for september our car was stolen so we have no way of getting to our destination explained the situation and were told straight up no refunds we tried to move the date but it charged us this is completely out of our control we wont be booking with them again losers and crap service
we travelled back to belfast from cairnryan on the ferry on wednesday th august unfortunately when we got home my young teenage son realised he had lost his mobile phone during the crossing i sent a couple of emails to different stena email addresses detailing his loss possible location on ship my contact details etc we woke up late morning no replies from stena fair enough time is needed to sort these matters out by about oclock we decided you know how important a phone is to teenagers to visit stena terminal in belfast to see if they could help there where members of staff on duty when we approached the deskkiosk we approached the lady wrong choice she had no interest in our situation no concern for my sons loss no intention of helping us i thought this cannot be this lady is a customer care representative for a major company who surely empathise with customers when they loose things and try their best to locate missing item not this lady as well as many other unhelpful and discouraging things she said the best was it really wasnt worth your while coming down to the terminal to try and get this matter resolved it could have ended like this however the younger gentleman sitting beside her raised his head he had been on his computer he quoted a number asked me was that my contact number he had obviously located my emails he asked me a few more questions he said hold on a minute please i will make a phone call he made the call came back and asked my son details about his phone in a very polite caring yet professional manner he left again and came back confirming to my now delighted son that his mobile phone had been found what a contrast this gentleman was interested in our plight showed concern for my son wanted to help he arranged for the phone to be delivered to him and i came back about hours later and picked it up thank you very very much aaron we really appreciate what you did for us to the lady who basically had no interest in us or our situation please learn from this young man
they are an incompetent rip off company i booked a ticket on the dublin holyhead routefor tues rd august on th aug it was confirmed in the my bookings section of my account and a booking reference was issuedprior to travel i checked for my ticket only to find it had disappeared from my bookingsi contacted their customer service by phone only to be told my booking was cancelled as they had not taken paymenti was furiousi waited over mins on the phone while the agent rebooked the ticket with the same details as the original booking referencethey took payment this time confirmed verbally but they insisted on charging me more anyway i went to the port and i was turned back unless i paid euro extra to board the ship i had originally booked on the th as the unknown to agent at customer service had booked me on the same ship but on the th of august by mistakethe stress of dealing with the port staff and not knowing whether myself and my family would be allowed to board as per our original booking was palpableand further they charged the equivalent of gbp for the pleasure stena are scammers and incompetentuse anyone except them they dont care worse than ryanair
we arrived hour later than the scheduled time the boat was very small for so many people avoid if possible
having traveled back and forth on the liverpool to belfast service at least times in the last months i can honestly say its one of the best travel experiences ive had my husband our dog and i have always had a great time everywhere is spotlessly clean and the staff helpful and friendly its definitely my preferred way to travel these days great job stenaline
we had an amazing experience with stenaline staff in harwich when a booking error came to light and the team moved heaven and earth to make sure we could still travel as planned special thanks to ben who was the customer service supervisor that evening the journey itself was once again smooth and comfortable with none of the horrors reported from dover and calaiswe will definitely be back again when travelling with our own car
my crossing on the skane from trelleborg to rostock was very comfortable and went smoothly before the trip stena line informs you that passports are required for the trip and when checkin closes a very helpful service for people who dont find out more about this beforehand before the trip we were also informed in an email that there would be a lot of new staff on board and on land and asked for patience if they couldnt handle everything like an old hand straight away but i didnt notice any difference to other ferry trips the cabin bed outside cabin had as described on the internet a bathroom with toilet and shower beds below and beds above which turned out to be very comfortable at night in addition which i was positively surprised to find as it wasnt listed on the website there was a television with swedish and german channels the temperature was very pleasant at a constant thanks to an extremely powerful air conditioning system the bathroom was clean except for the shower in the shower there was a plug with stranger hair lying freely on the floor which i think is a bit disgusting but not too bad for some people this might have caused a bigger stir another negative point is the somewhat musty smell in the bathroom but the friendly staff on board would certainly have helped with that overall however the cabin was clean and nicely furnished i have already traveled on the skane in but there i slept in a recliner because cabins were fully booked at that time however based on my experience snoring guests strangers feet suddenly appearing between the armrests i absolutely do not recommend this the extra charge for a cabin is definitely worth it if available the food on offer is comparatively limited in a central restaurant two salads a fish dish chicken skewers roast pork potatoes vegetables sauce and rice were available the food was mainly put on the plates by the staff stena line can do this better on many other routes where they often serve a lavish buffet overall the food was tasty and filling the shop offers a typical range of products for a baltic ferry lots of spirits beer wine chocolate and a few souvenir items the prices are ok there but sometimes steep when a g bar of chocolate is advertised in the catalogue as a special offer for when the same bar costs on land but hey this is a ferry the outside deck is nice and big with lots of seating the floor is quite rusty in places but completely normal due to the salt water a really important detail for me is that stenaline has made safety the railings are comparatively high which makes it practically impossible to accidentally quotgo overboardquot on some other ferries you get a bit of an uneasy feeling when you approach the railing i think thats very good i finally arrived in rostock almost minutes late which is no problem for me on an hour night crossing disembarkation was also wellstructured and orderly in summary it was a comfortable and relaxing ferry ride apart from a few suggestions for improvement i have nothing to complain about and the main reason for taking a long ferry to germany and not going via denmark that you can relax is completely fulfilled
we booked the holyhead to dublin crossing on stena ferry and paid for reserved seats in the hygge lounge to our dismay we found that they are in a dark room with no windows we would never have booked them if we had known that
took the car by stena from holyhead to dublin very pleasant experience easy trouble free boarding i was asked if i needed any assistance due to disability ship spacious well kept and clean the staff in the stenaplus lounge were welcoming and first rate the food was excellent and a good variety of snacks and drinks available free the duty free shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced for the obligatory booze and cigs same on the return trip customer services dealt with a post trip query quickly efficiently and effectively top marks to them
i had booked the crossing the wrong way around and didnt see it at all after initially panicking and then talking to the supervisor i called customer service where i heard that i am really not the only one fortunately but had flex tickets everything has been transferred to our next visit to the uk i received very good help and the service was excellent a big for stenaline
we did a day trip from hollyhead to dublin the checkin process at both ends was seamless and the price is great however it was very disappointing that there wasnt any jamesons available in the duty free the seats were covered in strains the food was revolting more food went went back than came out even more was just just left discarded around the ship service was slow there is also insufficient parking at hollyhead
unfriendly checkin didnt let us board because of formalities better plan your route differently our vacation is now ruined thanks to this ferry make sure you take id cards that are valid for another months including children because stena doesnt abide by the schengen agreement
we made the crossing from sweden to germany with stena line for the first and last time although the harbor was quite clear and we could easily drive onto the boat the journey did not appeal to us once on board it was not at all clear where we could sit there were very few or unclear signposts eventually we find a spot the air conditioning is so cold that i kept my coat on for the entire hours we sat inside for clarity we ordered and paid for food in advance because we thought it would be easy not the case nowhere did it indicate at what time we were allowed and what food we were entitled to when we asked this to the lady at the cash register she was very unclear which made us think that something had gone wrong with our order we looked for another employee at the point where the information board hung but no one was there not even an hour later then it was time to go back to our car again incorrect and unclear signposts the car deck was not indicated correctly in short unfriendly or impossible to find staff not clear little guidance once on the ship and cold i no longer sail with stena line
best ferry trip for a long time clean ship and cabins friendly helpful staff excellent breakfast
made the crossing from harwich to hoek van holland last night to our regret this was not a pleasant experience from now on we will go straight to dfds with which we sailed to england three weeks ago and can therefore make a good comparison we had made a reservation for the taste restaurant three courses because checkin and boarding were very late we could not have a table before pm to our horror we were literally looked away after we had been sitting at the table for minutes the lights went out we were informed in advance when we inquired by telephone that the restaurant would be open at least until midnight this was such a downer after a long car trip really disappointing as a carrier do not offer dinner for the night boat we also found it very strange that it was not stated anywhere that am arrival is nl time a sign stated that shiptime would be uk summertime not so furthermore a mini double bed with duvet that is too small a beautiful ship indeed left a bad aftertaste about the stena line company
when i was in danger of missing my ferry i booked a later ferry on the way at an additional cost of euros contrary to expectations i did get to the ferry i had originally booked hour after rebooking i was allowed to use this ferry the euros are gone and they said it was generous enough that i would not be charged any further rebooking costs this is how stena treats longterm regular customers even the best quotgold statusquot is of no use i dont know what is generous in that regard
havent gone with you for years much due to your online booking and customer service not really working when you want to book it doesnt match your campaigns and you dont get any help or service from your customer service this year we got a trip from gothenburg to fredrikshamn with jutlandia but help it was actually far below my expectations the boat has seen better days and is musty and stale i think its time to completely renovate the supply was also incredibly meager on board
stenaline unfortunately i have to write down my frustration i have been on the road for well over years now the circumstances of my stenaline journey surpass anything i have experienced so far i am referring here to the journey on sunday july st from kiel to gothenburg we are in the holiday season which is not a bad thing the ferry company also lives from tourists nevertheless it cannot be that tourists are given preference because we truck drivers also pay the price quoted for the transport the food distribution which was usually separate truck driverstourists was this time a hopeless mess there was no separation and the food was unfortunately only lukewarm there were considerable waiting times of at least an hour when asked the employees asked us to use another ferry line i would like to emphasize again that outside of the holiday season the ferry line lives mainly from truck transport and i am shocked that we truck drivers are treated like cattle we have to share our rooms with an unknown person and that during corona times sharing a cabin was unthinkable when the values were so high no distances were kept on deck and the ferry line did not pay attention to this either so that a mask requirement might have to be made the stena line employees in the restaurant and reception are protected by plexiglass but unfortunately the passengers are not what is also not normal is that the tween decks are opened again for the tourists shortly before departure so that they can stow the drinks they bought on board may i just briefly point out that we are still dealing with corona and this is all my own opinion i am still appalled that this is being done to us truck drivers perhaps someone from the ferry line will read this and give them food for thought stay healthy everyone
i traveled with stena line from fishguard to rosslaire and was very satisfied everything was clean friendly and helpful even my broken english was no problem they spoke slowly and everything was good
the cartel arrangement that stena line have with irish ferries have made the irish sea one of the most expensive stretches of water in the world to cross its no coincidence that fares are pretty much exactly the same with both operators however the expense is not matched with a level of experience you would expect at that price level expect outrageous food and beverage prices stifling hot cabins should you be as unwise to go for this option and no towel provided on this occasion noisy staff using staff areas next to supposedly quiet areas like cabins and recliner lounges and finally to give an idea of the utter contempt stena hold for their passengers they dont even reply to or monitor reviews on forums like this i can think of absolutely nothing positive about my experience of stena line other than at least the ship didnt sink halfway across
since january ive completed x return trips on birkenhead belfast route on all journeys weve found the service to be consistently excellent boarding has always been on time at both ports the ships were spotlessly clean weve always booked a cabin as wed chosen the departure from both ports cabins spotlessly clean really impressed with the shower found it easy to sleep as corridors really quiet also used the stena plus lounge on a couple of occasions again found this more than adequate and could give some airline business class lounges a run for their money boarding and disembarking has always been quick and efficient would definitely recommend this route even though its a hour drive for us driving from london
its scary we were denied the crossing from our holiday in sweden back to germany we are german the reason the children dont have a passport and in a completely unfriendly way how does she think we got to sweden we swam or with passports and then threw them away since when do we need childrens passports within the eu the lady didnt care if and how we got to germany she obviously enjoyed exercising her power never again stena line we came to germany with tt line the same day friendly and without a passport
halmstad to grena there are not enough seats on the ferry to accommodate all the passengers when you enter one of the cafes there are people camped out in the booths and chairs sleeping the service is slow to non existent i do not recommend this particular ferry at all it is old and outdated avoid if possible
i travelled from harwich to hoek van holland on the night crossing on th july i had booked an inside cabinthe toilet would not flush and there was little or no running water for washing or showering i later in my trip wished to change the date by days for my return having originally paid for a flexible ticket was told it would cost an additional and on the thursday of making the call was told it was fully booked until the monday no carpark spaces were available on board although i travelled by motorcycle my friend booked through direct ferries and was told he could sail home on the sunday for you are really poor at retaining you customers and this is a good example why stuff your return crossing i went direct with dfds dunkirk to dover no problem
recently travelled from dublin holyhead and back on intrepid boat july first thing to say is the staff on board could not have been more helpful both times when i arrived onboard i was approached by a member of staff to see if they could be of any help being a wheelchair user and my wife with a yo this was not only helpful but just made for a really friendly experience as we had missed our ferry on the way home we had to be transferred to a later one also a really easy process on the phone and i no longer had a wheelchair cabin however the staff where able to source me one and get sorted for someone traveling in a wheelchair this experience would make me choose them every time
i arrived at the stena line ferry terminal on friday two swedes of arab origin who had bought tickets were denied access to the rostock trelleborg crossing on the grounds that they had quotnot checked in at least minutes before departurequot apart from being denied service they were treated with absolute disrespect and the operators showed no interest in their argument they even called the police very soon it was a very unpleasant event for the rest of us travelers in reality it would have been easy for stena to process their bookings and print tickets and they did it a few months before when the same thing happened back then with quotwhitequot passengers this very big difference in approach makes me judge this as a case of discrimination
aerrived at the ferry no cabins were cleaned plenty of people had to stand in the hallway and wait for over hour so that the service will finally clean the cabins unacceptable some people including me were over hours on the road and were looking forward to get some rest as soon as possible it would have been better to make us wait in the car longer instead this should be improved as soon as possible considering the fact how much it costs for the trip
we recently took our car to the west of ireland but owing to our distaste for the recent behaviour of po opted for the overnight crossing from liverpool birkenhead to belfast with a luxury outside cabin i have to say it was one of the most pleasant ferry crossings we have ever experienced from efficient boarding to departure but particularly because of the hotelquality spacious and comfortable cabin with access to outside balcony lovely big bed sitting area though i never did get the coffee pod machine to work and even a decent shower will definitely use this crossing again
look i dont know where to start now lets start with check in this might be the longest thing ive experienced secondly it takes ages before you actually enter the boat thirdly theyre never on point when it comes to arrival or anything theres always a min delay their cabin isnt well cleaned and so on theyre so much this company needs to improve i would personer not recommend it but if you have to the i guess
yes it was perhaps more expensive than i would have hoped but i found this one of the most comfortable and easiest form of travel i have experienced in a while getting on to the ferry with our camper van and two dogs was a doddle no long security checks you just drove on we had pre booked a cabin and this was well worth it i found the staff in the restaurant and the duty free helpful and friendly the man in charge of the restaurant seemed to go out of his way to ensure that the restaurant provided the highest level of customer service this was certainly a five star experience
euros for kiel gothenburg and back with my citron jumpy unbelievable ripoff as i read online it actually seemed as if the ferry was almost fully booked but that wasnt the case the inside cabin was awful the ferry didnt make a good impression overall the buffet that i had booked was surprisingly good but im considering whether i should even bother with the return trip and instead take the land route via malm kolding to kiel never again and never again at this overpriced rate
endlessly the speakers would provide us informations about the restaurants and duty free openings and closing i and probably about other passengers on this trip would just have appreciated one little vocal message explaining why we should put our phones on airplane mode without even using my phone the absence of this little vocal message cost me and many others more than euros
pure ripoff oneway and return journeys cost the same and when you book online they say there is only a little space left in order to drive up the price euros for a return journey in a t bus alone just ridiculous
the logistics are a complete disaster cars that have been standing for minutes are waved in immediately and other vehicles that have to wait several hours are ignored at all a complete disaster never again
this has to be the worst experience in all my travelsand ive had to deal with ryanair customer service sat in dublin port for hours following the engine failure of one of their fleet no food at all on offer bar a couple of croissants that i wasnt quick enough to get my hands on some made up story about sandwiches being made but not enough not a single slice of bread or lettuce leaf was to be seen by anyone credit to the crew for handing out water bottles but it is beyond a joke i only booked the ferry because of the chaos currently seen at manchester airport seriously ian hampton and paul grant you need to have a word with yourselves and the irish sea operations team we finally departed dublin at pm some and a half hours later then we should have only to be told theres no food offer in the premier lounge again credit to the steward and his team for doing what they could which was only to apologise but with honest sympathy after all they have homes to go to as well you could say we were all in the same boat
im worn out trying to book a sailing two weeks from now several hours spent firstly it cant understand i want to sail east then just when its got my payment it announces there is an error totally crap it i tried po which is notoriously bad but it just had a mental breakdown no wonder its going bust
we traveled on the skane from trelleborg to rostock on june th reviews are always an individual view of the things we experience and they couldnt be more different we found the crossing to be pleasant the ship including the toilet area was clean the breakfast buffet was ok for a ferry on a scheduled service its not a cruise ship the departure and arrival were on time we would be happy to use the ferry again
travelled rosslare to cherbourg on th may returning friday rd june sheets in cabin were stained and duvet was really dirty there was very little choice in food which was cold and disgusting boarding was a nightmare i was put on the outside upper deck the nd ramp was really steep and inexplicably they stopped me way up it was impossible to hold the car on the handbrake i thought it would only be for a minute so held the car on the clutch it took ages and unfortunately the clutch started to burn there was no reason to hold my car there as the top of the ramp was clear a trip which was already expensive will probably now include the price of a new clutch staff were unhelpful i will never travel with stena again
i used their dog kennels for the cairnryan to belfast crossing for my month old pup i was appalled to find out mid crossing that i was being denied access to check on my pups welfare until we docked i was further dismayed when after queuing to get access to the car deck where the kennels are with the smell of vehicle fumes in this area the woman on the reception was very unhelpful and dismissive of my request to get access however i was offered access on the return after we were on our way by an extremely rude member of staff who didnt have the common decency to identify himself because i had opted not to kennel my dog the reason i didnt was i had seen several dogs with their owners on the outward trip i also had seen other dogs in the vicinity and in fact spent the rest of the journey next to a man who also had a ten month old pup but hadnt been harassed by this gentleman both dogs were very well behaved for the entire journey
i travelled on stena lines new route from finland to sweden it was not a very pleasant excperience everything is very overpriced with this company the twoway route cost almost euros and it trip really wasnt worth the price the meals onboard cost euros and they were awful there was no drinkable water on this ship for free not even with the meals on our way back from sweden the timetable was a mess the departure time changed twice and a we had to wait hours in the harbour just sitting in our cars no one told us what was happening when we asked about this the only answer was this is normal with stena line it also smelled like paint in our cabin and there were little small black bugs in our shower the most dissapointing thing was the customer service it was rude and unhelpful luckily i can use other companies to get from finland to sweden the only thing i can except from a company this size is that the timetables are correct and the customer service is polite neither of these happened will not be using stena line again
there is really no option but to travel with stena line if youre wanting to take the ferry over to ireland irish ferries do operate the same routes but are functionally similar and differ only by tending to offer more awkward sailing times this is the only way in which i can recommend stena line a market so devoid of competition has become necessarily stale if youre wanting to take the ferry be prepared for exorbitant pricing over the last several years the prices have only seemed to have risen these rises seem well in excess of general inflation yet the service remains at best adequate but hey you have no choice micro purchases considering youre paying through the nose you might expect to get a free coffee or similar on board think again everything costs once youre aboard indeed their whole business model is focused on making you just uncomfortable enough that you consider buying their food comfy seats or wifi disgusting food i may be something of an usual case here as i am vegetarian and have been for over decades i can without doubt say that their food offerings for vegetarians rank among some of the most nauseatingly inedible plates of technically food that i have ever encountered my partner who is not vegetarian assures me that their more traditional food options are little better the general state of the boats i have never sat down on a stena line ferry and thought to myself well this is a pleasant place to spend the next few hours the boats are always understaffed unclean and generally uncomfortable regardless of the above you remain to have virtually no options if you want to take the ferry tofrom ireland from most of our ports so there is little chance that the situation will improve given this this review is at best an psa in terms of expectations
hi i sailed the holyhead dublin crossing on the stena adventurer monday th may sailing in the th floor cafe a lady named ella was serving her professionalism and moreover the constant smile and attentiveness was key to my happy experience this lady is the face of customer service that if anything is wrong with any other part of the journey which there was not ella would have taken that all away well spoken and quick to deliver ella if she worked for my orgnisation would be my head of sales a joy
booked a flexi ferry from cherbourg to rosslare for august at a reasonable price unfortunately had to go home sooner direct from spain so had to cancel seamless refund on the website i had the money within hrs in my account just checked other ferry companies and no one else gives a full refund into your bank account its a credit note on your ferry account that has to be used within months fair play stena definitely a positive for future bookings
we were concerned about a trip holyhead to dublin given the feedback on this site we were pleasantly surprised check in was straightforward we had a car and it was easy to board we found decent seats the ferry was not full which presumably helped all was clean and comfortable plenty of staff around to answer queries and they were polite and helpful we had tea not overpriced at less than for two a big mug we had breakfast on board one of us had the full breakfast which isnt cheap at but it was a full big plate and all the breakfast stuff was nice to eat i had a breakfast batch egg bacon and sausage for would order again wifi was free for an hour then we could log in again for a further hour this was a real bonus disembarkation was tortuous we were one of the last to get off and there were long queues for security
amazing lady called pauline at dublin check in helped two very distressed women yesterday through a difficult situation we cannot thank her and the port staff enough for their help they went above and beyond
what a sleazy company that takes advantage of forcing you to buy a cab during a day trip just to make money they havent done that before but now the excuse is quotthat due to the prevailing covid situationquot the year is traveled last year when the situation was worse with the virus because then it was still there but no cabin was imposed then my trip suddenly became more than sek more expensive because of this disgusting invention as a student this is felt in the wallet and you are punished as usual for being single of course it is the same price for a berth cabin as it is for a berth cabin again just disgusting not only that the companies buy up properties that they then completely ignore in managing and let fall into disrepair around the country under the name stena real estate but now they want to extract all the kroner from travelers that they can i really hope a competing shipping company with better values emerges soon if at all possible thank you and goodbye
i traveled with my son on the cairnryan to belfast route on st may and there were several issues the ship was overcrowded mainly with football supporters who traveled in dozens of coaches none of them were wearing masks and while some were singing others were drunkenly sleeping across more than one seat and we couldnt find anywhere to sit we could only see two other people wearing masks despite the notice displayed regarding mandatory face masks there were very few staff available to offer assistance there was no emergency safety evacuation protocol announcement many of the football supporters were drunk and the bar still freely served them alcohol when it was time to make our way to the car decks to prepare to disembark the queue was at a standstill for a considerable time and the crowd was closely packed together they were chanting stomping and banging the walls there was no crowd management and density of people crammed into the stairwells felt extremely dangerous there were extreme levels of bad language and sectarianism and also people were smoking in the ship despite this being disallowed the ship was delayed by approximately minutes and there was no announcement or apology although our outbound trip was fine overall this particular return trip was terrifying and i am concerned that we will now contract covid as a result my son and i have gone to lengths to follow the guidelines and be careful to protect ourselves and other more vulnerable people during the last minutes we were taken pity on by a member of staff and invited into the private lounge some other passengers appeared to be in a similar predicament and were paying in order to escape the chaos
stenaline recently cancelled my sailing from dublin to holyhead and i wasnt the happiest i later found out via the news that actually the rescheduled a lot of their ships to keep logistics moving while pos ferries were out of action not only was this for a very forgivable reason they recently emailed to apologise and offer me off my next sailing id also like to point out that when ireland closed its borders at christmas due to the pandemic stenaline issued refunds i had booked with a competitor who refused to give anything other than a credit note that needed to be used within days customer service means a lot in such troubled times thanks stenaline
lovely experience upon this boat from birkenhead to belfast polite friendly staff clean areas excellent deluxe outside cabin was impressed thank you will pick in future to travel with
i travelled from holyhead to dublin yesterday st april and was most impressed by the cleanliness and quality of the stennaline ferry and the helpfulness of staff excellent n
great experience on my trips from liverpool to belfast and my return from dublin to holyhead all crew and staff were very helpful the ferry was very clean it was a lovely smooth journey and both journeys were on time
awful aweful aweful already half hour late departing belfast havent even boarded yet lousy tannoy announcements are barely audible ferry line not updated since th aprilnearly a week ago cant believe the price we pay for this privilege come on stena must do better
i had an overwhelming experience with the stenaline shipping company after my fatherinlaw and brotherinlaw had to flee from the ukraine via crimea moscow and latvia with a young family with a yearold daughter because of the russian war of aggression after a day odyssey the five of them finally arrived in lipaija completely exhausted and i called the ticket office there to buy transfer tickets to travemndegermany explained the situation and the lady said that everyone would be brought to germany free of charge i didnt know what to say and had tears in my eyes i hadnt expected that and when we were finally able to receive all refugees in travemnde they said that they had been treated like kings on board the ticket office in lipaija knew about it as soon as they arrived there and on the ship they were given wonderful cabins with a fruit basket and all amenities as well as free full board i can only say thank you from the bottom of my heart thank you for this human gesture in this day and age extraordinary we will never forget you gerald henningsen lindaunis
brought and paid extra for two flexi tickets holyhead to dublin because i was told by stenaline i could change dates and times at any time at no extra cost well that didnt happen apparently because i was moving to a more expensive ferry i had to pay almost interestingly their definition of a more expensive ferry is a smaller boat with fewer facilities and on a thursday add no decent food cinemas that didnt work and no announcements to say we were going to arrive an hour late it really was an awful experience ill never use them again
my husband and i travelled to ireland on th march to a family occasion we went into premier lounge which was so disappointing and definitely not worth the price less than hrs before our return departure date back to uk stena contacted us to say the had transferred us over to irish ferries as the had cancelled our return booking irish ferries is not suitable for passengers its more a cargo vessel the car deck was filthy wet floors not properly lit up tripping hazards with ropes from the huge lorries parked beside our car it was a shocking experience hrs late leaving rosslare on board it was filthy dirty club class is rubbish toilets absolutely filthy some not working its totally put us off travelling by ferry its certainly not safe for passengers travel either by car or on foot very disappointing stena you have let us down this time
travelled on the day ferry from hook of holland on monday dep scheduled to arrive could easily have docked on time but didnt for reasons unknown no information explanation or apology people left standing waiting for the lifts to work most unmasked for almost an hour probably take the tunnel next time
sailings on a welsh ferry route have been suspended as the operator tries to plug gaps left in northern ireland stena line has cancelled all crossings between fishguard pembrokeshire and rosslare republic of ireland until april we were booked on april and discovered cancellation via bbc news absolutely appalling customer service
cancelled the sailing from fishguard on march at less than hours notice and transferred the booking to pembroke which departed at that caused me to miss an important pre booked family event which was the main purpose of my journey then added further insult to injury by cancelling the return departure from rosslare at on april transferring my booking to an irish ferries sailing and a half hours later i notified my hotel in wales that i wouldnt be able to check in until about instead of the hotel said dont worry it happens on a regular basis with stenaline a truly cynical disgraceful way to treat customers in future i will book with irish ferries avoid stena its run by clowns who havent a care in the world about the impact of their actions on their hapless customers
left dublin when we should have been arriving in wales they gave us a pound voucher to keep tide us over but didnt even last for food until we left dock an absolute joke of a company i will never take them again serious about taking money but not about service
i traveled from glasgow city centre to belfast on the th of march till saturday th on the city link service we paid around pound return each which was great but i wasnt sure if we had to pay foot passengers as we always took a car i asked the chap at reception if i had anything to pay after showing him my tickets he said we still had to pay pounds as the boat was boarding we paid found out this was wrong and emails them also phone they got the emails as of now no refund no nothing
absolutely horrible customer service and outright lying reception we had the unfortunate luck to sail with stena during storm eunice we were meant to board ship from the hook of holland but after getting no notification about the ship being left early we arrived at the port at only to be told that the ship already left all they could do was rebook us into the departure we have waited hours in the car park and another hours on the queue to board the ship but then we were told along with cars there the ship got cancelled at hours after the actual departure date they were telling its running late we didnt have any place to stay so we asked the reception for help the lady there called several hotels to try and book us in and failed i found some hotels and asked about the price and confirmed that it was okay with the reception i was told to send the invoice to an email address then we left the reception at am when we finally returned to our home i sent the invoice to the email address and didnt hear anything back for days then i called and i was told the email address i was giving written on a card by the receptionist is wrong and i should use another one i sent the invoice again and got a reply saying that they cant reimburse me i told the same story and got the same automatic response i tried reaching a human but the customer number tells me that only way to reach customer service is email all they can do is help with booking over the phone i sent another emails which i am still waiting to get a reply i must say that this is happening with two pets and my month pregnant wife we had no place to stay or go to as we live in the uk and just visiting netherlands do not ever take their word for anything as they are clearly lying and leaving their customers helpless
we travelled to ireland on the th of march and having been on lots of ferrys before we was shocked with the journey dirty ferry food very poor
i have travelled on stena line belfast to liverpool a number of times and never knew about deck until the lovely tina pointed it out to me the views from this deck are stunning i always book into the stena lounge which is fantastic and worth every penny i am always treated like royalty i love it thank you to all the team on stena edda pat ransome
on a trip of endless misfortune misled prices missed trains buses and planes stenaline has been the guardian angel to lead me out of darkness firstly i had to cut my trip short due to work reasons but last minute flights are above my pay grade so i was forced to reassess my options i booked a midday stena from holyhead to dublin the payment stalled and went through twice i had now bought duplicates instead of i emailed the help service team and within hr and minutes i was fully refunded for my blunder on a lovely one thanks to lovely laura so then i booked a train ticket from piccadilly manchester to holyhead the ticket service omio who by the way a pack of scammers lead me to believe i was buying train ticketshrs prior to departure however i had only received at the ticket booth long story short i missed the train and consequently missed the stenna i had to pay for the extra train ticket and now expecting to be forced to book the later departure they offer h or more full refunds and a refund for anying over hrs sound isnt it i decided to chance my arm and ask for my ticket to be amended to the later and low and behold the lovely janette had responded within minutes another stenna angel tickets amended at no extra cost find me another transport service as swift and accommodating as that youll die trying mate absolutely cheers guys dan
we got on the ferry from birkenhead to belfast at pm on friday we were told there will be delay while they fix the boat but we cant get off or get our car off at about am on the saturday they started making plans to get everyone off the ferry we were off late as we have a month old baby who was really not happy about any of this we then queued for a further hours in the terminal for a resolution they promised more staff in the terminal but there was only dealing with people while in the queue i managed to get hold of someone in the call centre at about am we managed to change our booking to the holyheaddublin ferry after almost no sleep we then had a mile drive ahead of us we then found out the holyhead ferry was delayed for hours due to the weather the only fair point throughout when we were queuing for the ferry my son was going absolutely mental it was very distressing as we could not comfort him while the car was moving very slowly or sandwiched between cars so we couldnt open any of the doors to comfort him feed him change him etc we arrived in dublin at about pm and drove another miles to belfast the journey should have taken hours with a cabin to sleep in it ended up taking hours for us to arrive in belfast with no cabin and a young baby we set off at pm friday from birkenhead to arrive in belfast at am sunday morning ive contacted stena line numerous times for a resolution and the best they could give me is a refund off the cost of the trip i originally paid they also kept blaming the weather for cancelling all trips on the stena edda whereas we actually know it was broken down they did this to avoid paying out to all of the customers for a cancellation due to a technical fault in their terms and conditions you cant get compensation for cancellations due to the weather we cut our trip short to avoid getting on the stena edda on the way home vesselfindercom showed the ferry had not moved since we got off it but we somehow ended up back on it if your ferry was cancelled between and between liverpool and belfast contact stena because its very unlikely it was due to the weather and you will probably be due compensation although not much much because they really dont care about their customers refund is a joke
thank you stena staff between th and st february storms dudley eunice and franklin meant it took days to get back to n ireland from the mainland every member of staff i came into contact with on the phone or at port or onboard were so helpful polite and friendly going the extra mile to get us all to where we needed to be cant thank them all personally but stena uk management be proud of your crew amazing people
liverpoolbelfast storms on friday th feb so my son changed sailing to saturday th this was cancelled so next available ferry was today monday st this was cancelled so booked tuesday this has now been cancelled so a week off work and not worth travelling for a short stay no confidence ferry wont be cancelled again obviously this is the last thing stena wants but really not a great experience i visited my son in dec and my night sailing was cancelled again due to bad weather meaning the ferries were out of position luckily i was able to change booking to a day sailing but this cost me a fee as i did it at the ferry terminal and the night sailing was more expensive in the first place which again was dissapointing
booked to return to uk from ireland ferry booked for we arrived at ferry docked in front of us at at we had a stena employee knock on car window sorry due to another boat coming in we will be running minutes late we were already minutes late for over minutes sat in car just watching the tug take containers onto ferry eventually got on for after once on and set sail went to find shop sorry shop closed today nothing in there anyway just empty shelves poor service
booked the ferry for i arrived at terminal at only to be told there was a delay due to technical difficulties which accounts for what as far as i could see the dock workers were in modes go slow and stop anyway was expecting to depart around oclock didnt even get on the boat till eventually departed at oclock the half hour delay turned into an hour and a half and all you get is a sorry for the delay funny thing is if youre mins late they more or less tell you tuff luck
havr used previously but recently i went for cairnryan to belfast and got there in time but was told ferry is cancelled bad weather fair enough went to buy the ticket for next sailing which was hoirs after was showing but was told dont buy as it is likely to be cancelled too so waited for update and then all of sudden price hiked to then i thought just go to window n buy there as was stuck all day and at window they had cheek to charge thats one car one driver what a rip off staff on board was good and helpful but as a company they really milk their users for food there is a great cafe in stranraer morisons if you have time only min drive if it was up to me i would make a bridge and then see how much they can charge
stena liverpool absolutely terrible experience waiting at the liverpool stena terminal arrived hrs early on wednesday evening with hungry kids and what was the reward for being punctional we were loaded last and made to wait frm to to get on board bloody joke stena have no system to ensure if you arrive early you get on early a complete disorganised mess no management system in placecomplete shambles rang and ask what the hold up was and was told to write in to raise the issue stena blamed securityand they blamed stenatotal mess plus the ferry was mins late departing
n my recent journey out of belfast with stenaline i left my handbag behind in a nearby cafe as i had already checked in i could not leave but a member of staff diane barrett went to collect it they really went beyond what would have been expected of them
we have booked crossings to england with stena lines several times and have always been very satisfied with the booking and trip processing however with our last booking flextarif i had to make a change to the return journey as the stena online booking system did not allow the rebooking due to an incomprehensible error message i had to rebook by email and pay more after a written complaint stena acknowledged the online booking error but the additional cost was not refunded
truck drivers at stena line are obviously immune to covid at least nobody is interested in protecting them the main thing is that the boat is full the main thing is that profit is right
i am a periodic user of the ferry service to the mainland either to liverpool or to cairnryan from belfast booking online has had its issues despite booking our pedigree dog in for travel with us within our vehicle this was not passed onto stenaline reception staff who threatened to refuse us boarding as the dog had not been listed in the booking what an issue to start with most recent journey with stenaline belfast to cairnryan jan we booked a meal on both leagues of the journey at a cost of per person the quality was abysmal to say the least mass produced and almost ineatible no flavour whatsoever and cold i would advise travellers to bring along their own food snd beverage if this is the best that stenaline can offer fancy a bowl of soup and bread roll at i think not stenaline get a grip on customer service and provision you certainly charge enough for the passage to provide a much better quality of food and service onboard
ordered ferry last minute from hoek of holland to harwich in my car and first time travelling with puppy i messed up and didnt do pet worming in time but they rebooked it following day with very little charge most likely an admin fee customer service all round was great from boarding to dining nothing bad to say at all everything was also very clean and very well organised
just rang up for information on changing cancelling travel due to covid restrictions changing and they were very unhelpful saying not govnt trained and that all info including cancellation fees are on website theyre just a ferry company apparently
the customer service department and all the staff of stena liverpool belfast line were extraordinarily kind helpful and empathetic on my journey yesterday when i had a serious family emergency they supported me through a very stressful day and were proactive in their efforts to make my altered arrangements run smoothly thank you to diane naringa craig billy emma and all the others who helped me
each time i have travelled post covid ive found the port security staff have put me on edge they always insist on going into the cabin of my car handling things touching the wheel dash my bag anything i dont ever see them use hand cleanser gel between searches of different peoples cars either theyre quite supercilious in their attitude too and one told me a bare faced lie about a newly reinstated sailing time this used to be such a friendly port with lovely staff now i completely dread the check in process here to be honest im going to try my luck with po next time check in must be better than this
website review booked a ticket quite easily from frederikshavn to gothenburg and now i have also canceled it quite easily much easier than with dfds still need to see the money back but its probably a formality otherwise the review will be changed
weve waited hours to get in to the ferry weve been told theres hours delay but instead there were will never travel again with them
really bad website and really bad help afterwards in customer service another ski holiday has to be booked and unfortunately we are forced to book via stenaline because it is a constant joke that every year in the booking process we all find that the website is incredibly poor and everyone has some bad experience i book a package tour with ferry and accommodation paying the deposit and unfortunately not aware until after the payment has gone through that the website has not registered my chosen ferry departure so i got one in the evening practice i call the next day and speak to a sweet employee who will check if i can rebook the appointment i receive an email that i can do it until which is not what i really wanted but accept and also accept that i have to pay approx dkk for the change i actually dont understand the email from customer service it reads as follows then things have changed your link is the same xxxxxx it takes some time before the change is seen online so check this afternoon when i inquire at the ferry department i am told that an update from your side after you have booked may be rejected when you want to change depending on what is booked and the prices we show i have understood that it was not what you explained from the start when you say you could not change the ferry in the booking process but i have been given an explanation for that when you subsequently want to change then the remainder would have to be paid which i am in favor of doing when i go in via the link i can see that there is an early morning ferry departure and the price shown is not much from the price that was at the departure in the morning but i would like to investigate this so click on it and then click further to see the grand total here i can see that it will be significantly more expensive and therefore go back and click on the original ferry for which i paid approx dkk to get rebooked now its completely crazy suddenly there are rebooking fees for bookings i choose to contact customer service begging to speak to an employee who speaks danish or understands danish as it is somewhat difficult to explain all this mess in english i am told that it is not possible but i can call again later or wait until middecember then there will again be employees who speak danish i do not agree to wait for this as i have tickets that need to be taken care of before i will then be put on to another employee who will go through the process he maintains that i made a mistake and rebooked these ferry departures myself i try to explain that these were not rebookings it was to investigate the price difference and that i absolutely do not go in for fun within minutes and book my ferry ticket times he says its a shame he cant do anything about it it is my own fault that he can see that it has been a mess from the start he is very dismissive and i end up saying i actually dont want to travel with them at all so rather cancel my booking completely i can do that he says i just have to pay over because that is the remaining amount what he keeps asking if he has to cancel for me and im trying to figure out why i have to pay extra it must be the case that the deposit i paid is the only thing possible for me to lose in this ridiculous situation customer service or lack thereof the employee points out that i can file a complaint but that probably nothing will come of it my conclusion on this whole stupid situation is stena line is completely indifferent to its customers customer service is a city in russia and going forward i will find other ways to get to and from norway
i had excellent costumer service on the sailing from cairyan to belfast from a staff member named jackie nothing was a hastle to her
we booked a sailing from england to northern ireland whilst dealing with a stressful situation our first up close experience with stena line was at the birkenhead terminal where we quite by accident spoke to a man name unknown who worked at the desk he was absolutely excellent fully understanding our difficult situation offering practical help our second encounter was with gethan based in the call centre at holyhead again he was absolutely superb and so practically helpful he very clearly cared about us and wanted to do all he could stena line is a big company but the sensitive personal attention when we really needed it was exceptional sincere thanks to both of you men the sailing itself was excellent in a ship that we found clean and comfortable all in all an excellent experience with stena line
terrible company website doesnt work impossible to change bookings online even when paying for the extra services to change free of charge and rude staff when emailing in they try to charge just for asking questions via email a nightmare to get anything done and takes up hours of your time i would try other ferry services first food on ferry is also terrible and paying for meals in advance doesnt include a drink which costs a fortune
honestly cannot fault stena line they were attentive on messenger when i had questions prior to departure we booked cabins to and from the netherlands because theyre so cheap the cabins are spotless with better water pressure than at home fantastic showers the beds are so comfy every member of staff was polite and helpful the return journey had the potential to be a nightmare as we hadnt filled in the locator forms i literally had a melt down luckily the stena lady at check in recognised a fool and helped us i absolutely cant thank her enough theres no way we couldve done this on line without her help she mightve been called rachel but not sure hero then when we boarded the ferry one of the bar staff heard i was upset and poured a little extra wine into my glass with a smile and a welcome weve been travelling with stena line since the early s when addrian entertained our kids and really its too far from bolton so who knows when well return but stena line we love you xx
just been return on the holyhead dublin ferryhave read other bad reports on here and was not expecting muchbut lets be honest its a ferrynot a ocean linerbut stop therebecause its a contrast to what i read it was a fantastic experiencehappy greeting on arrival at the checking booth helpful ground staff directing me on boardthen the deck crew were cheery and again helpfulthen the ship and staff itselfclean efficient and just brilliant all roundgood food coffees and generally happywell done everyoneand thanks for a great experience both wayswell done to you allfrom someone in the event business
i travel with stena often as i have parents to visit in donegal i have had the most horrific experience with them and lack of respect having had my car damaged i parked it safely and stable went to my cabin and when i came back to my car it was damaged the level of customer service i have had was awful i would not recommend stena line in the slightest whatsoever think twice before booking a ticket with them absolutely shocking
i have almost always traveled with stene line frederikshvngteborg since at the end of september i had to return to germany early due to illness and could no longer rebook online so i rebooked at the counter in gothenburg and paid kr a good euros my question quotwhy not the quotnormalquot eurosquot was fobbed off with strange explanations i often traveled there and back for euros before the pandemic for me thats pure ripoff back in germany i hung on the hotline twice for a good minutes haha of course no answer ok you pay fees for the economy fare stenas answer since your ticket is an economy fare there is an additional change fee of and a rebooking fee of what does quotplusquot mean i have already booked and paid for the return journey as normal
the journey from holyhead to dublin was delayed for about hours we were informed about this and were given each vouchers for food however on the return journey we again were informed the ferry would be delayed and were given the time to arrive we then spent at least hours waiting when we got on the ferry we were given a voucher for people which barely covered the cost of hot drinks
dublin to holyhead paid for premium lounge however it was over crowded and no social distancing with people walking around not wearing masks the coffee machine was out of order and there was only soft drinks available not much food choice only some muffins no chance of gluten free options it would be a great service if there was an improvement in food and beverages and decent customer service irish ferries is much better on the positive the sailing was smooth and on time
i have always travelled with stenaline but as a gold customer i would not recommend them to anyone their customer service department is awful they cancelled a ferry on us so now no stena plus on the ship so they gave us a refund for that portion and told us they would give us pp to spend onboard not really customer service so i will take my business else where i am sure irish ferries cant be any worse customer services dont even want to know and dont respond to all of your messages out of experience i am also a travel agent and certainly would look to advise my customers of booking with someone else because if this is how they treat me this is what a customer would receive very un happy customer
if booking fails because you either need a credit card or are naively asked to give your online banking login details to the website where not even banking giants like dkb are represented then go on holiday where you dont have to disclose your details or are at least accepted as a normal citizen who doesnt have a credit card
credit card fraudsters used my card to book travel on stena line ferries worth due to poor security systems used by stena line ltd when i reported this to stena line finance team they showed disregard that fraudsters had been able to book tickets with ease and travel on stena ferry transport what a company had no idea stena operated in this way
in july we drove by car on the stena line ferry from travemnde to liepaja for the first time we were very happy with the whole trip checking in with the car took a little longer because all the trucks had to drive onto the ship before us but we found this really exciting and interesting our sleeping cabin was perfectly fine its just not a luxury steamer the food was also sufficient and delicious at any time of day the staff were friendly throughout we didnt miss anything and we can only recommend the stena line it is primarily a car ferry we would use this route again at any time
cairnryan to belfast monday horrific traffic and citylinks incompetence meant several foot passengers arrived minutes late for boarding vehicles were still being loaded for another minutes but stena refused to allow pedestrians on it wouldnt have been too difficult for stena to drive them on in one of their own vehicles but they kicked everyone out and locked the building stena did exchange tickets for another boarding except several people had nowhere to go and had to spend the night outside it was degrees and pouring rain but people were made to wait outside for the first morning ferry stena were well aware that some people needed to wait for the next ferry and wouldnt allow them on the pm one either belfast to cairnryan thursday stena held up the ferry for minutes because a bus was running late dont travel with them unless you are on their preferred passenger list their callousness and customer service is beyond belief ive enjoyed my trips to this point but now view them as a necessary evil barely better than the airlines
on september we traveled with friends from trelleborg to rostock with the stena line a sixhour crossing corona must be a foreign word on board no checks when boarding the ferry no one paid attention to wearing masks and keeping a minimum distance in the toilet there was a note that it was last cleaned on august i spoke to the service staff about this and they explained to me that they had probably missed the entry the toilet was cleaned an hour before departure and this is done again after arrival in rostock so after hours i estimate that there were about guests on board when i asked the staff about the shortcomings i received the answer that they are very short on staff and that they would be very happy to receive criticism maybe then something will change i dont think so the outward journey with the ttline to sweden proved that things can be done differently here signs in front of selected areas indicated that masks were mandatory and the food on offer and the quiet on board were also much better so it works even in corona times
poor information policy customers are not given an address where they have to go to board or check in at the ports everyone has to find that out themselves using google no one has yet come up with the idea of writing an address on the booking confirmationticket even on board the ferries you have to laboriously ask around in the various onboard restaurants what dishes are on offer and what the prices are
travelled liverpool to belfast sept on emblacrew very courtious and helpful used a kenal for my dog who has never been in a kennal before but he was happy enough ship was very clean and fresh
where do i start paid more for the crossing to ireland then normal then the shop is only open for hour on a hour crossing they run out of vodka cigs before my partner could get inside the shop we even asked out the back completely run out would not let me buy bottle of jamesons for my mum next to my bottle on way out to ireland main bar run out my beer poor food choice and again shelfs are bear return leg we made our own sandwiches thank god toilets need abit of a clean only good points ferry on time and big lounge which was quiet really need to improve and bring back the old days
planning a lot of travels from cherbourg to rosslare about once every month weeks travelled this route about months ago with stena and the wifi was free that was my reason to book with them now i see that its minutes free or buy minutes this is a big pity because the long voyage gives me time to catch up on and answer emails i feel in this day and age wifi should be free apart from this its a perfect service friendly staff and clean ferries
had booked to travel just before christmas then lockdown happened and changed an open ticket wasnt explained this would be a basic fare and there would be plus amendment fees feel ripped off luckily for me irish ferries operate into rosslare going to cost me to cancel but wont have to put up with stena line
if i could i would leave stars th august birkenhead belfast bound apart from the joke of a cabin situation on board only using floor of cabins for the day sail as was keeping the other deck for the night sail so they didnt have to clean them in the hrs inbetween sails mins before disembarking i have a very bad fall due to a crumpled mat anyways the way i was dealt with was discusting i have since lodged an official complaint this has been dealt with in the worst manner ever the staff have lied through their teeth to cover up the major mistakes made not phoning me and ambulance at my request i even offered to phone it myself according to the assistant manager they dont like to send ambulances unless a cardiac situation said manager then lies during my complaint process saying she offered twice to get an ambulance taking my children aged and away from me with out my permission or knowledge and sending them down in the lift to wait by the bus after a few minutes once finished telling my husband on the phone what was happening i ask were my children are to be told they are waiting down stairs i ask to be taken down to them to find they are not there they have been put on the bus alone my daughter phones me in hysterics wondering where i am i tell her im on the bus she tells me she was told to get on the bus without me even though she didnt want to i was very upset by this and being in pain also i did shout wondering what was going on who told my kids to leave me and go on their own on the bus the male staff member with me proceeded to tell me he didnt know what was going on as he was upstairs dealing with me so he had no clue well during the complaint process this male staff member has gone on to lie also saying he told me and i agreed for my kids to travel in the bus from boat to port on their own what a pile of rubbish i never said that i didnt even know plus i would never allow this as my year old daughter has a visual impairment if the staff had told me or asked me i would of brought this to their attention basically staff have put my kids ar risk without my knowledge and then lied to try and cover their backs appalling i havent even got to the treatment at the port being left to our own devices to navigate through the port to taxi outside while in a wheelchair with all our luggage the baby in pram and my eldest daughter several snotty staff members and a mess up regarding wheelchair taxi a complete joke the whole complaint procedure has been even worse of course they had to admit liability for my fall that couldnt be disputed but ive been fobbed off and staff have lied the bit out to get out of my terrible treatment and the kids being put in danger not to mention my year old traumatised by the whole ordeal safe to say my solicitor is well on the case and i will never be on board a stena boat to liverpool ever again on a brighter note they are changing all their mats aboard the ship so no one else has the misfortune to endure what i have its a shame i didnt get details of passengers who witnessed what was happening that would be very helpful for me
a dismal experience travelling with stena to fishguard booked a cabin and was woken an hour before docking why for the convenience of cleaners food available was shocking inedible sick passenger vomit remained on the floor in cleaned at the duty free shop so much for health and safety of passengers infection and fall hazard will stick with irish ferries next time i travel from rosslare
absolute horror payment by card only reserved meal time chargeable callssim newer ship compared to ttline but thats all i will travel only with ttline
the ancient and rusty ferry was fully booked chaos on the car deck chaos in the corridors people were lying around everywhere even in the cafeteria the sleeping mats were rolled out neither the guests nor the staff wore a mask but they said that masks were compulsory its a joke in sweden i found it totally relaxed without the masks on this ferry the lack of masks seemed rather threatening staff were generally unmotivated to overwhelmed hardly spoke germanenglishswedish the cabin was modernized and ok otherwise it was rather dirty the meals were almost inedible cheap watery yuck and no im not a complainer i often travel in scandinavia eg with viking or silja line these ferries are almost all older but absolutely great both in terms of food and service usually even cheaper than stena or ttline conclusion if you go to sweden or norway then only via denmark resund bridge to finland i would only take finnlines the higher price is worth it
completely disgusted as we booked a deluxe cabin return journey but changed the booking for an extra daysassured that the cabin would be available for the return journey to find out on the day there was no cabinsyet again stenaline are concerned about making money than looking after the customercomplete disgrace
request dear stena line i plan to travel from rostock to trelleborg on in the daytime due to age and health i may need to sleep on the way is there such a possiblity aboard and how much will it cost reply good afternoon thank you for your email please provide your booking reference number and we can check this for you if i can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me laura tommis contact centre team leader request i do not know this will be a ferry on either at am or at pm i was told so by a tour operator my decision to travel depends on your answer i understand it would be much easier with a booking reference so i am asking for a favour thank you very much reply thank you for your email if you have booked with a tour operator please contact them directly to book a cabin if i can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me final laura my tour operator is unwilling to make inquiries he may think there will not be enough cabins and if some passengers can have them and others wish but do not have them this will cause complaints ok if i were an individual tourist why do i have to make a booking and only afterwards find out i explained why this is important to me i also explained why i must know before i buy a tour not afterwards i am asking a simple question is there avaialbility or not and if yes how much i will have to pay direct aboard i hope it is not some secret you know the date and the two alternative departues you also know the itinerary i suggest you go with this message to your management if there is no answer for me please do not bother writing back i am surprised though and ifwhen i share this surprise publicly there will be a few more who will be suprised thank you for your time yb
i travelled with stena line on the th of august its the nd time my experience with them was very distressingi travelled with my family a disabled teenager and month old baby and my daughterwe asked if we could have a cabin but they was all taken upthe women called diane was on the reception she said there is a list and we can be added to the listmy last journey i was told families will be priority we sat down and waited to see if we was going to be called for a cabinwe heard a family being called and seen them get up and go to reception it was teenagers around yrs old with there parentsi went back to reception and asked if we can have a cabin but was told first come first served and that family was firstits a disgrace that we had to struggle sat in chairsmy son has autism and was very anxious and unsettledthere was a family with small children all laid on the floor absolutely appallingthe staff at the guest service area was very unhelpful and said we shouldnt of travelled with kids if we couldnt get a cabin she was so cheeky everyone was looking and listeningits the second time the staff has been extremely cheeky and i felt so embarrassed
we were quite apprehensive about sailing for the first time since covid but we were pleased to see that passengers werent packed onto the ferry sanitiser was available and the boat felt clean staff were smart friendly and helpful shout out to the lady in the duty free shop who was somehow managing to serve customers from two tills at the same time i stupidly booked our return trip the wrong way around but received a call from our arrival port before booking in and the staff at our departure gate sorted it without any fuss thank you
my daughter her husband and sons were traveling in early august from holyhead uk to dublin port to visit us and my son in laws parents with stena line for the first time since the pandemic began every one was so apprehensive and excited but our youngest grandson because of the pandemic has become very anxious worrying about every little thing in life he so wanted to see his grandparents but was worried about something happening on the hour car journey to the boat that the weather would be bad at the port and they would not be able to sail that there would be so many people they would not get onto the boat the boat would leave without them and or the boat would sink or they would not be able to return to the uk once in ireland while they were making their way to holyhead i contacted stena uk with much difficulty and in fairness spoke to several stena staff who eventually put me though to the holyhead booking office there i spoke to thomas and explained my grandsons concerns and anxiety and asked if someone from stena line could find the time to met them and to give my grandson some reassurance thomas spoke to his line manager and the reassured me that someone would meet the family and in fact he would do his best to meet them himself saying that he completely understood my grandson and appreciated how challenging the road and sea journey must be for his parents and brother a very emotional daughter rang me from the ship and said that they were met by thomas and that he was sooooooooooo nice and made a big fuss of our grandsons he went above and beyond his duties to reassure our grandson and so very much to make our journey as comfortable as possible the family on their holiday never stopped mention thomas and the extra mile he went for our grandson and were further taken aback when they received the same experience on their return journey i want to complement and thank everyone employed by stena for all they did for my grandson and his parents and to say that they are first class people regarding customer service i truley hope that thomas and all the other staff only ever experience this same quality of customer support in every experience that they have and praise stena for employing such brilliant people especially thomas
excellent service in the stena plus lounge on my return trip on the stena embla from belfast liverpool and again liverpool belfast i recently went on a staycation with my yearold son and i just wanted to say that courtney and kayleigh were both fantastic as ambassadors of the stena line crew unfortunately there was no availability for a cabin as you can imagine travelling alone with an yearold is not easy these two young ladies provided topclass service and were very professional accommodating and ensuring we had the most relaxing time in the stena plus lounge a very delightful journey both ways and we will most definitely be travelling with the stena line again soon
the first and last time i traveled with stena line hoek van holland to harwich no clear directions on arrival in fact sinage was horrible couldnt use the tv in cabin a bunk bed was infront of the tv paid for single beds seaviewgot a room with bunkbeds the smell in the hallways was awful asked staff until when the duty free was open they said until uk time got there at h and it was closed it was open for less that hours food was over priced and staff were rude except the coffee bar staff who were very friendly not worth the money at all always use dfds decided to try stena line to make a great start to a week visit to the uk the idea was to have a good rest and do some duty free shopping total dissappointment never again
actually everything is great the rebooking option definitely needs to be revised if you only rebook the date you shouldnt have to reenter everything else youve booked unfortunately thats what happened to us and then youre stuck somewhere with small children with no rest or sleep on the night ferry unacceptable we went straight to reception on the ship we were first on the waiting list and still didnt get a room
i would like to thank diane at the belfast to cairnryan check in we were checking in at belfast to sail to cairnryan this morning we had a problem with the way i had booked our sailing diane handled the situation very professionally and ensured we had a very pleasant trip thank you diane
a ferry ride that will make you shake your head its its august corona has dominated the news for over years now and the virus is omnipresent omnipresent sure but not on the stena ferry from rostock to trelleborg when booking the crossing you are informed of the existing restrictions and hygiene regulations only those who meet one of the three quotgsquot are allowed to travel ie vaccinated recovered or tested check before departure negative as we noticed at the ferry port the evening before a young family had not met any of these criteria due to the early boarding at am it was probably no longer possible to take a test you can guess three times who drove onto the ferry two vehicles ahead of me and thus without the necessary test on the ship you feel like you are in another world a world before only a few passengers manage to wear a mask correctly usually it hangs on the chin if it is present at all and serves at most as decoration there are no minimum distances in the queue to the restaurant and people are busy pushing and shoving at the coffee machine an older man with a chin guard in particular stands out here he must have had an urgent need for human warmth when he snuggled up to me from behind in the queue an accidental step on the foot at least created a minimum distance in summary the crossing shows all human ignorance coupled with indifference and selfishness oh the stena employees yes they usually wear the mask correctly but dont care about their hygiene concepts but i do wonder why this pandemic is taking so long
great companyeasy boarding went on there new ferry was going to ireland for dads funeralwas upsetcaptain of ship saw i was upsetmade me and patner a coffee himself then gave me a cabin free for my children true gent and great company friendlywelcoming helpfull and proffesional staff
then stena line has become more restrictive with border control as a danish citizen you can be refused entry to denmark if you do not show a passport but a driving license when you want to go from gothenburg to frederikshavn it is stena lines policy and has nothing to do with danish legislation and at the same time you experience unpleasant service employees when you want to go home from a nice holiday in sweden i am shocked by stena line nothing is written when you book your ticket about this requirement and only when you are about to board the ferry will you be denied access to your own country
be careful when going on stenner line with these testing results a friend of mine had a testing result was told it lasted hours to get there to find a jobsworth saying we cant accept it because it had to be hours this is conflicting not very good for the traveller and certainly i would not consider now going with stanhoe at all i was going to but im not now avoid the ferries what are the covid is on
big shout out to stena line travel centre in holyhead bought a rail sail from trainline from ireland to uk which you cannot collect avoid trainline like a maskless antivaxxer with a really bad cough stena sorted out the mess for me they didnt have to but did it efficiently and with a smile thanks folks
i arrived at cairnryan port on th july for the sailing there was a issue with my ticket martin who was working in the kiosk as your enter the port sorted it professionally and politely nice to see good helpful staff
currently sailing to scotland on the belfast to cairnryan ferry mandatory mask wearing on board is non existent and the staff doesnt seem to care no wonder us nhs workers are tired and stressed i feel safer on my covid ward than on this boat
yesterday i travelled with the stena line meckpomm from trelleborg to rostock this boat really seems to have seen its best days the whole ferry stank of toilets in the toilets when they were open it stank to high heaven and there was no toilet paper there were no enough rest rooms for the duration of the crossing lovely families converted the cafeteria into a large kindergarten with a childrens runout and rollingout area with appropriate acoustics the food in the canteen i wouldnt describe this catering any other way was only accessible with a long queue when there was hot food all in all everything was more creepy than inviting somehow i remember ferry crossings from the past differently and better what on earth happened
on the trip from rostock to trelleborg on the swedish ferry everything was great and the childrens play area was open on the return trip on the german ferry everything was different the toilets were dirty smelled bad and the high toilet entrance edge was not marked so that children tripped over it the play area was closed the armchairs were in a walkthrough room where there was a constant draft and the smell of leftover food so there was no chance of any peace and quiet
what we can say about this company and how they behave bought a trip from sweden to poland and from there continue to other countries there is no demand for corona test for transit through poland but suddenly received a sms from stena that i need test to can come on the boat looks like stena its another country when you are reserving a trip they ask you times if you dont want to buy flexi ticket but when want to cancel they dont ask you they are just happy if you push the button in the beginning of corona when all the countries started to close the borders like rabbits i wasnt able to contact them or to cancel the trip so lost money for that trip too sad that in this times when people should gather together to go through corona as easy as possible there are this types of companies never again with stena
every member of staff from checking in at liverpoolbirkenhead to disembarkation at belfast was courteous and very well presented special shout out to laura who helped me with the car parking app i was travelling first time on my own and her helpful kind manner put me at ease and was representative of the whole stena team the ferry itself was immaculate the cabin very spacious and comfortable and i felt very covidsecure in the stenaplus lounge food was top drawer looking forward to my journey home
travelled from holyhead to belfast on last nights sailing staff at portside and onboard are a credit to the company pleasant courteous and could not have been more attentive and helpful thank you
i travelled to holyhead from dublin on june and all the staff from the stena plus lounge to the young ladies in the shops were all so helpful and polite an excellent service from stenaline i will be travelling with them in the future
i just got off the boat from birkenhead to belfast and was in the lounge and lynn was great couldnt help enough thanks lynn the flip of a coin and now back on the boat going from belfast to birkenhead and not helpful at all wish lynn was on this shift
we had two ferries booked to france last year one with stena and the second with another company stena have been amazing they converted the full value to an open ticket with very clear explanation how to use it just been on to use that open ticket staff knowledge friendly and very helpful all rebooked with a credit left which has been refunded to my credit card i am a frequent traveller with stena but this time theyve excelled themselves the other ferry company cant compare stena another very satisfied customer
i havent yet had the pleasure of sailing with stenaline however i have had to both ammend and cancel a booking due to covid and their service has been exemplary easy to contact swift response to queries and really friendly service some other big companies in the travel sector could do well by taking customer service lessons from stenaline i look forward to the experience when i am able to actually travel with them
we had a family of today and couldnt fault the staff onboard for all theyve done amazing and thank you hopefully book again in the next week holyhead ireland and back
it is always an absolute pleasure to sail onboard with stena line staff are friendly and efficient and the facilities are great
i traveled with my little daughter who is still in a stroller and was given a room on deck but i wanted a room on deck so i didnt have to take the elevator up with all my luggage the service was great we swapped my room straight away at the information desk very helpful and attentive staff unfortunately the wifi only works for minutes and you have to log in again despite that i would travel with stenaline again
just arrived back from the holyhead to dublin sailingi was booked for the sailing and arrived late due to been stuck in liverpool tunnel for over an hour and half because of an incident waited for the next sailing and explained to the stenaline assistant what had happenedshe let me on no problem without asking for a penny morebooked a cabin on board very reasonable for fantastic service normally use irishferries definitely moving to stenaline from now on
company ask come to check no later than hours before loading to ferry we came hours before now sitting and waiting in the care nearly hours no toilets no water nothing my wife is pregnant lorries loading before small cars bull shift not sure is it the same all ports or only liepaja i was driving car hours to the port and now hours sitting in the car never use again stena line
hi i just booked larne to cairnryan with stenaline bookings i spoke to joanne from holyhead office who took my booking i just want to say how pleasant and helpful she was and provided a fab service many thanks mervyn
never again will i use this crowd absolutely appalling on every level my two ferries this weekend consisted of under cooked food in the morning sailing had to it send back rude staff nothing new vending machines turned off so they can charge you double the price for a hot drink at the bar no food on pm sailing without any prior warning to passengers use irish ferries times better than this crowd
my sister and i have just arrived in ireland yesterday to see our elderly mum who is quite poorly from the staff directing us towards the ship to all the on board staff in particular romona a big shout out to her as we were exhausted from driving from our homes in norfolk to holyhead and she gave us a complimentary cabin to rest all the covid safeguarding measures on board were excellent well done stena line you will always be our transport of choice extremely grateful passengers sandra neylon monica parker

we have just came back from ni to liverpool and i cant praise staff on the ferry high enough such an amazing experience we found on the day that we have only booked one recliner for two of us and have been told that they sold out of every single seat after speaking to one of the member of cruise staff this wasnt a problem and we have been given a seat that was spare due to no show really recommend this company
the kind of really unsympathetic employee you have to look for a long time we have booked a ticket gren halmstad to continue with ystad rnne on wednesday i receive an email that the covid situation calls for attention i call and talk to a really nice employee who assures that when we are only transiting sweden and going directly on have a ticket to ystad rnne then there are no problems today the day of departure we will be called hours before departure by a lene message on answering machine she informs us that we cannot come with us i assure you that i spoke to someone else on wednesday i call stena line and speak to a young guy who lives in frederikshavn he says that the information i got on wednesday is quite correct and that they have people traveling to frederikshavn gothenburg the rules are on the swedish polices website its getting pretty stressful we are driving towards gren after all we only have that holiday we are a little late on it due to ringing calling stena line when we are driving and daughter with soninlaw is driving in front of the road stena line promises to inform the people that we are coming at the last minute daughter and soninlaw arrive at the ferry berth minutes before departure and see that the ferry has sailed when we arrive minutes before departure i go to lene and she is having a party i ask why the ferry is sailing minutes before time i had called they are allowed to send it off when everything is as it should be and we had to leave minutes before time since we didnt get there and everyone else was checked in they are allowed to let them sail here we are with tickets for vehicles useless and lene says we could have just accepted the offer to rebook i am so angry does lene have special agreements with the customs officials in halmstad since you can easily get through sweden via gothenburg
we traveled with our pets from holland to the uk our first ferry crossing with our animals and we were quite nervous about the facilities for them it turned out to be lovely we were given ample time to board our animals and luggage the kennels were spacious and clean warm and they even had spare blankets and cat litter and litterboxes available the walking area is spacious and tidy we all had a smooth and relaxed crossing thank you stenaline
this is my first time on stena days ago with dogs and my partner the ferry crossing was on time they sent my partner a update on his mobile text message and email we waited for about a hour and a half for loading which is normal my partner has done this crossing many times when we did get onboard we had to take the dogs to their dog lodge area using a code to open the door the dog lodge had bedding bowls water facilities and also had a food box if you need it also some doggy dirt bags and a mop and bucket it was very clean and very presentable we stayed for a few minutes and even thru we booked cages our dogs wanted to sleep in one we have shih tzus and they fitted in one cage perfectly our room was perfect and clean a bit hot but we had a good nights sleep the lounge area was perfect the gentleman behind the counter serving coffees was very friendly we did take our coffees outside to stand outside the dog lodge area which in hindsight was a good thing the other person that had left her dog in there come and got her dog but when she left she hadnt closed the door properly so we could open the door without a code it was sitting on a latch so anyone couldve gone in there and taken the dogs it does have a camera right above the door which could be a deterrent but thought we would just point out that the door doesnt close properly all the time everything run like clockwork and even thru we had a long wait to get on we was one of the first off so it does even out
disgusting do not useleft me sitting in a freezing docksaid they did not have correct country code to contact me however there were no signs up at the dock to say the sailings were cancelledstaff arrived amthe lady l was soposed to speak to told me to wait at main entrancefreezing raining bad bad windstood there till l thought l would collapse with cold she never returnedsat back in car to try dry off and warm upstill no lady turned up banged on staff entranceyoung lad very decent tried help me transfered me to irish ferries and gave me a discount on next crossing with stenna lineinsult is not the word as irish ferris is cheaper anywaystenna line has shown no humanityno respect they offered me a discount if l booked while on the phone to complaints took the offer within the callthey are and have taken away the good old irish welcome l will never use them again and would certainly never recommend themthey can keep there were sorry voucher with discountbecause they still work out more expensive than other companies with no insulting discount plus they can not explain why no notices were up at the port stating the sailing was cancelledavoid them your choicebut my advice is go with a company that has humanityand knows the difference between humans and cattle
our booked crossing in august from sassnitz to trelleborg and back was quickly rebooked by stenaline to rostock trelleborg because the booked ferry connection had been discontinued on the outward journey there were a total of seats for us dog owners lined up one behind the other in a drafty corridor where people were constantly walking through no sign of corona protection everyone without a mask our return journey was then rebooked more times at short notice in the end we were rebooked on a tt line ferry supposedly the original booking number was also supposed to be valid for tt line but we were in for a big surprise the automatic checkin didnt work at all the booking number was not known to tt line instead we had to go to the checkin counter where people were already waiting the staff there were completely overwhelmed and were unable to issue the correct boarding pass no sign of corona protection there were people in the room which was designed for a maximum of people all without masks the majority of them romanian polish and bulgarian truck drivers after waiting forever a completely distraught employee handed us a boarding pass with a false name and of course no access to a cabin thats not how customer service works if ferries are to be combined at the green table because of insufficient capacity then please do so with sufficient advance notice so that the staff can prepare for this and process the rebookings in good time
in we booked a round trip ferry ticket motorhome and people from frederikshavn to gothenburg for because of corona in sweden and a planned onward journey to norway we did not start the trip stena line offered without us asking to convert this ticket into an open ticket and for us to be able to book a new ferry trip in free of charge until this procedure applied to tickets purchased before i think march later the deadline for a new booking was extended to march it was always suggested that only a rebooking was possible but not a refund i also read this in forums now here it comes in i wanted to rebook the ticket for august there and september back the transfer would now cost a whopping more which i didnt like so i called stena lines service number and lo and behold i was offered a refund for the ticket without any discussion conclusion anyone who still has an open ticket from can now get it refunded
i made a mistake and booked my ferry the wrong way without noticing until in arrived in birkenhead on th dec at ten oclock at night danielle lennon at customer services could not have been more professional courteous and helpful she did everything she could to help our self inflicted situation when we got on board eventually we saw a staff member in the restaurant help a young man with storage issues that went away beyond any expectations of the company the personnel on board were also extremely helpful as was the customer services support on our return journey well done stenaline excellent services as usual
i was gob smacked just how good stena line were today with the borders shut in europe and due to sail tomorrow i managed to call them get my call answered get reassured and move my booking back hours in a total elapsed time of min sec the guy on the phone told me all hands are on deck i mean seriously operate like that in times of crisis you have my business for life truly outstanding
fishguard rosslare tuesday cancelled due to bad weather rebooked for weds this was also cancelled the night before contacted stena again was told they hadnt run on that route since previous friday their other irish sea ferries were running so rebooked holyhead dublin pm longer journey for me both sides but i was now a day late and needed to get there driving enroute was advised there was a hour delay arrived at holyhead and advised now a hour delay had to get to ireland as i was now going to be hours delayed i got straight on irish ferries scheduled for pm departure the stena ferry i was due to be on was further delayed by hours i accept bad weather can stop play but surely weather affects both ferries in the same way irish ferries crossing was smooth and uneventful discovered irish ferries service now well staffed better shop cafe restaurant and better opening hours of all facilities on board totally superior service all round
had to get back to ireland in a hurry was in holyhead stena did not let me book a ticket at the counter so i booked it online for a walk on passenger they honored the ticket drove me down to the boat loaded my bags when i got to dublin the guys there were very good allowed my partner in to the building out of the cold made sure that my bags were delivered swiftly and helped us on our way the new boat is super many thanks again stena
after reading a few of these reviews i was a bit hesitant with taking car getting to and from it with the covid stuff but they staggered the embarking and disembarking we had a cabin which was serviced nicely we still took own covid measures but i felt totally safe throughout and the staff were fab thank you
outstanding service our ferry crossing from belfast to cairnryan was cancelled this morning because of stormy conditions in the irish sea the company rebooked us onto the liverpool service which left an hour later gave us meal vouchers to use on board because of the longer crossing time and a discount voucher for our next trip issues happen and problems occur but how they are recovered is a measure of the quality of any company stena did an amazing job in helping resolve this situation and poor weather isnt even their fault and have demonstrated themselves to truely care about their customers such a refreshing change to other companies whose behaviour we have experienced in recent months which has been purely to focus on their profit and revenue with complete disregard to customer service well done stena we have appreciated how you treated us and will recommend you without hesitation
stenaline from holyhead to dublin st october pm sailing appalling covid precautions and enforcement on this crossingmy wife and i spent as much time on deck as possible due to fear ofcovid transmission there was no enforcement of mask wearing on passengers by crewnot once did we see cleaning of any dining surfaces or public areas during the crossing how can you place so many people into confined spaces and not enforce mask wearing we will never use this service again because we want a transport service that cares about its clients health during covid
stena line dublin to holyhead th sept ferry cancelled at short notice and had to stop an extra night in ireland stena line say a big no to any compensation for delaying my return by a day irish ferries for me in future stena have gone down hill quickly since march they are using old ferries now and not the new estrid all crammed in with little social distancing very poor service and very poor customer service now
delayed by hrs then was waiting after arrived for hr what was supposed to be a hr journey turned into hrs
after a booking and timely cancellation via direct ferries stena line remains silent and passes the ball back and forth between itself and the booking portal this is a ripoff and not legal reference number
wed booked crossing back in november from harwich to hoek of holland but needed to cancel them because of the netherlands being placed on the quarantine list sadly we only booked the cheapest tickets so legally were not entitled to a refund stena refunded us because we couldnt travel and we booked before the pandemic thanks stena a million times better than our previous experience with irish ferries back in
worst company ive dealt with during covid will not refund or give vouchers for ferry to holland because of government advice not to travel
had to cancel our crossing from harwich due to covid we rang them and they offered a full refund which i wasnt expecting the refund was in the bank the following day fantastic service in unusual times thank you stena will definitely book with you again
stena cancelled my sailing and moved me a later one when i changed this to an earlier sailing they changed me even though the earlier sailing was cheaper i feel cheated
called x mins min waiting to check whether hook to harwich would arrive before am start of covid quarantine was politely told no way certainly not eg we are working on it we turned the car around and did not go to hook i now see on facebook that the ferry will arrive before and we would thus not have to self quarantine our vacation lost due to poor advice from this company
i didnt think i would be leaving another review i couldnt thank the crew and staff especially connor who was working in the stena plushe greeted us as if we were old friends we were treated like two vips though it was very busy he had time for every onei had my scooter with me and help me to my seathe made sure that we had all the refreshments we wantedall the staff are polite and helpful especially connor we would like to pass our thanks
rang stena to book travel for myself and yr old disabled dad liverpool to belfast crossings as foot passengers i have used this route a lot as dad in wheelchair went to book to discover their prices have risen a lot rang stenaline to be told all adults charged same price including students no offers on my opinion is more people are travelling now its a bit safer with the corona virus and i feel stenaline are profiting from this as per person at night sailings is expensive as per person was the price before the virus an increase of is a bit much to many companys are profiting from a bad situation
had to cancel my booking and was refunded in three working days
had to cancel my booking due to covid no problem so i will book again when everything is clear i have heard horror stories regarding other operators connecting the uk with ireland and i an glad i was with stena line
i recently communicated with this operator i originally booked travel to ireland through direct ferries who have been somewhat less than competent however in the end i contacted stena directly and they have been brilliant all problems now sorted and now looking forward to our break in september thank you i will book directly next time
went to hook of holland from harwich very good service from the moment you drive on comfortable cabins beer isnt too overly priced and a very simple operation to drive off the boat on the other side
borders are being closed companies are being shut down and at stena line complete strangers are being locked in a cabin together so that the ferry company can save money on cleaning the cabins and nobody says anything and if you complain you are laughed at and belittled no matter what you want
useless when it comes to keeping passengers updated with delays you really need to keep passengers better informed just wasted hours of my telling me my ferry is on time when it isnt and i could have caught the delayed earlier ferry you really dont care
got this email fron stena line we wanted to let you know that of your points are set to expire by the end of the year dont miss out book now to save money by letting your points help pay for your trip points earned during will still be valid for another year basically forcing us to book before st december or loose our points terrible way for a company to treat their customers rang up today and was told to book before december or loose the earned point for well stena we will go with another company and give them our buisness as we usually go twice a year once in the spring and once in the autum eat on board and book a cabin after all we get hit hard with the motorhome and trailer re fares not a customer focused company
empty shop not enough seats restaurant closed hour into the crossing use irish ferries
i use stena on their cairnryan belfast route about trips per year i find them efficient with only one of our trips delayed due to weather in the last years as a gold member we get stena plus access for free which is great we sometimes take a cabin again as gold this is half price the crew are helpful my only criticism is sometimes the cost is rather high
