we found the competence and commitment of the aida employees very good everyone felt like they belonged we were well looked after and fed and were able to relax from everyday life
aidas new drinks menu seems like a costcutting measure that has come at the expense of taste and quality popular cocktails have disappeared and the recipes have changed syrups are now used instead of fresh ingredients and cream has been omitted completely spirits are hardly mentioned by name anymore which suggests that cheaper alternatives are being used in terms of taste none of the cocktails convinced me
unfortunately our purchased voucher from aida in the amount of was no longer accepted even though we had corona and a longterm illness not a reputable company
i had a completely new experience for my age spent exciting days with nice people
after years of aida everything has declined overall everything used to be much better
everything was to our complete satisfaction and according to our expectations
to gain an insight into the world of the arctic circle both historically culturally as well as current research and environmental aspects

northern magic with aida nov
on the whole all the employees were very friendly and helpful even when an order didnt turn out the way i expected it was corrected great
everything was a success
always my pleasure
a great way to get to know the world there are many opportunities on board
no accessibility for the hearing impaired compared to quotbefore coronaquot significantly higher costs and noticeably worse service
not for families with children rather for older citizens
allround package for relaxation

beautiful cities friendly service staffeverything good
aida prima has very good staff
everything was just right im glad i did it that way

everything already done
very good
ed was a relaxing holiday with an allround feelgood factor
a consistently good atmosphere in every situation and in every respect
simply keep what is promised
i think its good that certain things have an quotextra chargequot such as the use of the wellness area
a good feeling and joy from start to finish on board
i just feel like im in good hands
the development at aida is unfortunately a very sad one while service performance and quality are being reduced more and more on the other hand prices are being increased significantly in addition aida often does not adhere to its own terms and conditions but strictly demands that guests comply it is urgently time for aida to rethink and in addition to economic aspects of course to put the customer first again
unfortunately a necessary quotvisitquot to the hospital very friendly treatment and care
extremely courteous friendly serviceoriented board staff
staff and crew who always greeted us in a friendly and good mood and signaled to us that there is a good working atmosphere
rediscover norway aida makes it possible

great service very clean everything well organized
the concept club is good

aidas service is poor there is a particular need for improvement in the administration in rostock
everyone is super nice
it was ok but aida cant convey the feeling that youre doing something special
very good ships good service
better service than on land as i personally found the mattress too firm we asked for a topper in hotels on land we had only ever received several wool blankets on the aida it was no problem at all to get a topper i could also have had a side sleeper pillow if i wanted all of this was for an extra charge but it waswould have been affordable and therefore topnotch service there is a great atmosphere on board everyone is friendly and helpful you can get all the information you need at reception
everything was great no complaints
everything was very well organized
the community spirit and the relaxed atmosphere of the team no dress code everything was perfect except for a few minor details

aida takes care of its guests you can go to reception with problems and a solution will be found
please pay attention to quality and not quantity
allround perfect experience
everything great
we were very satisfied with the offer in a junior suite or aida lounge wonderful service you should be everywhere
always a hit we love coming back every year keep it up
great experience
assessment was transparent
you have to pay extra for everything the coffee is awful and the service from reception was not really helpful and not very customerfriendly because even when i asked for it the coffee machine i had ordered did not arrive i was only offered a glass of champagne as compensation which did not make up for my anger
you cant get by on the first day without a deck plan
everything was fine
regine uhlir

i love aida everything went absolutely smoothly and i will go again
the overall package with massages and sports offerings is perfect
great logistics from checkin to checkout
gladly again
cleanliness service very good always happy to come back
it started with our drinks flat rate not working on the first day and all drinks were debited then we moved on to the internet flat rate which can be used for devices if you want to pay for days of bad internet however the devices are only for one user so you cannot share them with devices if the device belongs to another user then we moved on to the photo flat rate we specifically asked what was included and were told that all shoots were included except the iris shoot so we did all the shoots only to get a bill for for black and white photos which a day later were no longer included in the flat rate we decided to do the iris photo shoot we knew it would cost extra and asked if it would be possible to get all the photos the iris photos and the photos that were included in the flat rate on a usb stick which costs for a cardboard usb stick the nice lady immediately assured us that this would not be a problem now we are home and of course the only photos on the stick are the iris photos which are also heavily overexposed meaning they were definitely not worth the x as you can hardly see the colors of the eye clearly on top of all that every activity that is heavily advertised costs extra the pools are very very small and always very full in general the ship was so full that we sometimes waited over minutes for our drinks often had problems finding a table for more than people and even getting a seat in the theater even the largest drinks package does not include a lot of drinks which is difficult to see on the menu and as someone with allergies it is unfortunately very difficult to get wheatfree bread what was positive was definitely the quality of the food it was very clean everywhere and the cabins were very nice with plenty of storage space the staff were very friendly and helpful overall i would never spend so much money for so little service again
professional familiar uptodate spontaneous friendly and courteous with lots of fun
i cant complain
i found aida to be extremely childfriendly no matter which area we were in
everything is well organized and you feel like you are in good hands
everything perfect
you get used to the quality level over time and travel but in some areas there is a lack of variety and the quality level does not always seem to be consistent
adjust priceperformance
i rate the overall package as very good
everything went really well a special experience great
great experience always happy to repeat
very good entertainment and a great range of sports on the aidanova the volleyball lessons with the aida trainer were very good

thanks to the good service informative announcements and selfservice the character of the audience is pleasantly openminded and friendly ie relaxed and not reserved or reticent
we were very happy that our expectations were far exceeded
the allround package at aida is right
it was a very nice time
everything was great especially the effort made by the multilingual woman at reception she was very professional and she made a lot of effort to ensure that all customers were very satisfied thank you very much
everything is great always
there is something for everybody
for me a really great company with fantastic experiences

the country and people in norway are very impressive everything is done carefully but effectively
everything was very organized and handled very professionally very friendly staff
after a delay of several months the aida online shop reopened on april it was advertised with a great new outfit and lots of opening offers however the shop was only accessible at lunchtime on april i immediately bought a dodo baseball cap for my grandson from the offer payment immediately via paypal but no information about delivery although according to the company there is information about this with the ordered item on my order confirmation there is an incorrect phone number under which no statement can be made about the online shop an inquiry by email which was answered immediately states that the item is currently not available but has been reordered however i assume that it was not in stock when the online shop opened when and whether it can be delivered is up in the air the whole thing reminds me of the times before the online shop was redesigned aida has no control over it and somehow no increased interest in stopping this customerunfriendly business practice absolutely customerunfriendly and not recommended
always ride with us
as expected and even better thank you
satisfaction and health

easy to perform
everything was fine
as always we felt very comfortable
aida as always

information and process well thought out
was great
it was just great
good in everything

logistics organization friendliness diversity
very good logistics and organization
everything was well organized
it was something different
i was very surprised by the perfect organization
it was absolutely great
particularly friendly staff everything well organized very clean great entertainment
it was very nice
the service and comfort
always maintain and improve the standard
there is nothing further to add to the assessment
that you can rely on aida and everything is just right
unfortunately the quality of aida services declines if you have many years of experience with aida trips exclusivity no longer exists but that is also due to the audience on board unfortunately we are no longer part of aidas target group as one of the people in charge on board said quotif there is only criticism then the customer is on the wrong shipquot that statement is true a little tip for aidas product managers you can optimize a product to death
it was just great
were on the aidastella on january rd my birthday i received an email with a euro voucher for the aida online shop so far so good the link led me to the following information quotour shop needs a vacation sometimes well be back for you at the end of februaryquot this note was changed in february to read as follows quotwell be back for you soon better than everquot on april th the link led to the following text quotthe online shop will be available from april th quot on april th the link led to the following information were sorry the page youre looking for could not be found it may no longer exist or may have been moved thank you for the valuable gift wellintentioned is not well done aida im worried about your organization
carefulness and helpfulness
fits as questions
i was completely satisfied
the good thing is that you dont have to worry about anything if you dont want to
we have found peace
no evaluation planned
as always it was a great experience friendly and attentive staff cleanliness great entertainment all around perfect
reminder friendliness and cleanliness
aida helped us a lot with the problem of number of pieces of luggage with eurowings thank you very much
great company very good quality food and drinks friendly service staff very good entertainment
everything is well organized
everything super organized
especially on deck there is a lot of unnecessary unrest for example the excellent lectures were constantly disrupted
great aida crew who provide excellent service
we felt very comfortable
great varied options on board very nice stops along the way new experiences impressions and memories
get away from everyday life do what you want or just relax
everything was well organized
if everything works like this time then thats fine not like the last two times
again and again for people who do not have all in as their motto in life
we felt very comfortable we will be back
simply great team
we felt completely at home and would love to come back
an absolute dream thank you aida
everything was very very nice and recommendable
there needs to be more flexibility in the form of individual customer requests
everything great

nice staff and helpful
aida is no longer aida the coronavirus has taken away its charm its a shame that its now all about money and less about people aida used to be a company that really felt at home
the people who work on board are simply amazing they make every day unforgettable
st time with aida we were satisfied well be back
we really enjoyed this first direct experience with aida keep it up
absolutely satisfied
almost everything was well organized
simply more than i expected
great organization for everything that happens on board and on land absolutely great staff simply wonderful
gladly again aida very good price performance ratio april family with year old daughter
great crew it warmed
i think that the usual service is no longer available
allround carefree package you could forget your worries and just switch off
because there is no hand ban on the nudist deck and cell phone cameras are constantly pointed at you nudism has become useless
wifi doesnt work the confusion about the prices is intentional too many options that cost extra
everything on board is just right
so far everything ok uprade would be necessary
everything was perfect from the service to the good support on board thank you for that
everything was perfect all around
helpfulness friendliness
i have had some great experiences with aida and i would book aida again and again
i felt safe
the entire system for all in needs to be reviewed and changed
the trip was great new terms and conditions not very customerfriendly regarding upgrades aida customer hotline very unfriendly and snappy quality has unfortunately declined profit maximization in the foreground
i have had experience next time i have to inform myself well
always courteous friendly service small requests are dealt with promptly even on the day of arrival never had a bad experience
see review aida
well thought out processes super equipment in the cabin
felt very well received and part of the group
dont book too early because the prices fluctuate outrageously
it was just very good
the company employs a large number of people from different nations what i personally find very commendable
great service from booking to the end of the trip always experienced and competent contact persons who quickly solved all questions and problems simply a super wellorganized barrierfree team we say quotthank you aidaquot
you can feel completely safe you dont have to worry about anything and can just relax and unwind
well organized
aidasee
always a positive and super nice experience
i can only say thank you again

very good organization mostly friendly staff
organization friendliness
super service
always aida can only be recommended
everything was alright
very impersonal treatment and poor consideration for relaxation
very nice experience

you got around a lot
completely satisfied
friendly staff good organization quick checkin

aida mythos was disappointing
super nice service had cool experiences
as always you can adjust to it
great organization super friendly and helpful staff completely satisfied with everything
the relaxation and the quiet moments
aida should preserve its independent image
everything is well organized i would go with aida again any time
the service area needs better training and the importance needs to be pointed out often no drinks are received or long waiting times the pool should be restored the pool does not have even coverings on the floor risk of injury
very nice friendly and competent crew
they say less is more but its never a good idea to save on staff too many additional costs bad organization
good organization very friendly service from the entire crew
relaxation and always nice and polite staff
everything fine
good organization of aida
what is bad for me is the feeling that you are always paying it used to be clearer and more open all inclusive should be all inclusive
once aida always aida
the entire survey
the complete offer
the allround care
it has been a wonderful experience i recommend it and i will do it again many times good service good food good programming and workers with an excellent attitude
everything is perfectly organized
everything was great
very well thought out even in the smallest details
on february i filled out a form on myaida and uploaded a pdf with the deposit statement a layer in the app showed the note quotfinishedquot no confirmation email arrived the trip began on march on the aida cosma on board they said that no deposit statement had been received in rostock the review of my remaining deposit statement from february has now taken days in december i received information that receipts can only be uploaded via the my aida app unfortunately that doesnt work and rostock doesnt bother to respond very disappointing
more smoking areas
overall i was very satisfied the staff in particular were very professional and courteous
highly recommended it was great
good service
it was easy to switch off
coherent processes
good organization great week
unfortunately aidas concept is to sell
the truth is everything is super
without rating
everything was great
everything top aida again and again
just
everything is great thank you
the complete booking and service
everything was just great
priceperformance
duration too long
very good and friendly service in all areas

the warmth of the service staff who do their job with heart and dedication
everything fit from a to z
employees need to be better trained in organization and goodwill
never again dirty cabin blood on the curtain strangers hair everywhere mold in the shower vent dirty windows so you cant see out the employees try to help you but most of them dont speak german which makes communication difficult long queues of people everywhere and an entertainment manager who insults his employees just to be funny
just beautiful
we couldnt have felt more at home
trusted is not a term for me it is just meant to provide security
the company should focus more on its customers and not make cost savings its corporate goal
top crew with a great captain the organization in all areas is great
because so much good has been said about it there is not much to add
everything went smoothly id be happy to do it again
great route with great service on board
great service beautiful moments there is not much more to say than everything was impeccable and great
internet connection problems
staff always nice and friendly
great team very courteous and friendly everything on this ship was perfect and our expectations were exceeded by far all we can say is you have to do it at least once
good organization and support
fun with certain limitations
good organization
always friendly staff and well organized departments
arriving home
i learned and saw new countries and cultures the entertainment programs were good and the lecturer was very good
the specified times were met and the information was complete and correct

very reliable and friendly
you just feel comfortable and at home
i was very impressed by the captain he answered all questions competently just great
once aida always aida
the overall concept at aida is right the organization program offers staff information are all right
the support from aida in advance was very good
despite our good rating we still have suggestions for improvement the aida lounge should only be available for reading the air conditioning setting was too cold in some places
allround care
always perfect
good experience
i really like the whole aida construct on the shinx class
everything is great i can only recommend it priceperformance ratio is great
checkin took way too long
once again a pleasant stay on board the aida stella many thanks to the attentive staff on board
aida generally speaks for herself
karibic was great aida was great
safe structured and wellorganized concept of processes digital service offers working atmosphere and teamwork as well as motivation from the manager the reception staff do a lot certainly not an easy job i found the foreign employees to be more patient and friendly reprimands and discipline of a german lady marlena an unpleasant form of communication otherwise great service under the stresspressure of passenger changes note where the hairdryermirror is
a very neutral survey thank you
everything is kept very neutral everything is good
overall very satisfied
it was an absolute dream from start to finish and no wish or request was ever granted offered or fulfilled
the entire staffsuper servicesimply everything
unfortunately aida has eliminated many of the services we loved thats why it only gets an average rating
its a very nice experience

gladly again aida
keep it up everything was good for me
everyone is very friendly and everyone has a smile on their face there are no unfriendly employees the employees good mood rubs off on everyone great keep it up
everything was great gladly again
completely satisfied
good offer super service
i can only recommend
perfect organization good value for money
relaxation and still see a lot
aida is just a great thing
doing everything via the aida app is good but then the paid internet should be stable unfortunately booking the flights worked in advance but the implementation did not could have done without it effort for nothing i got the euros back but the guy annoyed me for hours during the flight
top always beautiful
it opens the eyes of human humanity to other cultural impressions
everyone tried very hard
a very good concept good service customer friendliness
no experience
firstclass lectures by christian ptschke
service excellent
everything is well organized
everything was very good and very nice
in my experience aida service and quality are getting worse from year to year its a shame that guest feedback doesnt help to improve the quality
experience i gained on board aida mar
intuitive operation
aidablu has fulfilled our expectations for the rd time
questions were targeted factual
you see a lot and can discover new things
i am a simple woman and sporty the offer was enough for me it was important to me to do sport
very good organization good cleanliness good services professionalism we will come back for sure
nice cabin very friendly competent staff super organized in all areas
keep it up full satisfaction
everything had been great
too long now the required characters end
everything on board
aida still has a lot to learn starting with the staff
as always everything is good
reception mrs sabina or sabrina cheeky person and on wrong workplace
unfortunately aida has become a lowcost provider without actually being cheap a real shame i would never book again
overall very good priceperformance ratio compared to other providers
you step on board and immediately feel like youre on holiday the staffcrew are all friendly and helpful again and againthank you for the wonderful time from the first to the last moment
everything was great except the music selection in the disco
very good service and very good organization friendly and competent staff great vacation well be happy to come back see you on aida
good logistics good organization
survey is too long many things can be asked in summary and specified positively and negatively
an experience you should have at least once
this is my second time on aida and i am overwhelmed by how friendly all the staff on board are
everything extra
everything great
aida is a great company that i will book again
no internet little internet long speech from the captain almost min air conditioning set too cold
the services are attractive and of very good quality
perfect service
good provider especially for familyfriendly holiday offers
aida never again quantity instead of quality better choose meinschiff
the company does everything right to be profitable and thats a good thing after all aida is not the social welfare office personally i think everything is too busy too many people a clientele will develop or has already developed that appreciates that
everything was great
very nice and satisfied with everything
inquiries about problems
fantastic experience and good service excellent quality and price ratio
friendly and helpful
organisation
was very nice
all in all everything was ok
the staff was very friendly and helpful
they are professionals with good quality and equipment
indescribable
the complete package was harmonious
very good company would be happy to use again
there is something for everyone great entertainment program
everything was very nice
organization informative very good service questions were always answered to the fullest satisfaction priceperformance ratio is right
i felt comfortable
an allround package
familyfriendliness varied program
it was great
far too many questions some very annoying and timeconsuming
service is good overall but the wifi app and website need improvement and there is a lot of drinking
get to know the country and its people
everything is wonderful
everything is simply super organized
it was pretty good would book again
the friendliness and competence of the employees
this is all in the aida rating
as i am used to
we just got home and im already looking for new offers from aida
simply a great organization
make all inclusive clearer and more uniform
for only german spoken hardly any information in english
the cozy time of service
everything is great
keep it up keep getting better
only disappointment
you can discover a lot of new things and also relax the service on board is excellent
i noticed that the team has a good harmony
everything went well thank you
organization service friendliness and cleanliness
new impressions collected and again aida
the question for assessment seems ok
very good overall concept great crew highly recommended
totally relaxed and something for every taste

perfect organization and priceperformance ratio is right
except evening performance was not good
organization generally very good
everything was good except for the modalities with wifi thats why only stars
great organization great team
everyone was so friendly
dabai is simply beautiful
hardly any internet pool unfortunately too cold cleanliness super service super
always happy to do sobut dont let up and dont raise the prices any further
priceperformance ratio is great can only be recommended
unique friendliness of the staff with mega services throughout the entire travel time around the clock
aida again and again
better than mein schiff but has declined over the last years
despite the strike at the airport aida did everything to get us on board not everyone does that thank you
if problems are dealt with quickly and with very good quality the question remains why cannot their causes be eliminated
super organization great support from the staff
everything is great if you have enough money
i was always almost satisfied
very good in all a to z top
im looking forward to the next offers
discover many new countries
please do not force a statement
at aida the priceperformance ratio is no longer right
friendly professional and eventful for me just great
the whole package is perfect unfortunately the reception was not particularly helpful
it was great
in general i am very satisfied i would be happy to come back any time
aida has always exceeded everything so far
the entire process from checkin to checkout including cleanliness runs absolutely smoothly
unfortunately i dont have the time to write this the time i wasted on board was too much for me nobody cares about my complaints anyway im happy to be available for a personal conversation with aida
as always perfectly organized accommodating shortterm cancellation of the booked wellness suite and always with a smile on their faces
the aida app is the worst app imaginable examples when logging in you have to enter your booking number every time every time of course you dont learn it by heart and so you have to look for this stupid number in your documents every time of course the app doesnt remember this number which would be super easy to program but it seems to be a state secret that it isnt done or as with all large companies they also have a hobby of annoying their customers as much as possible nd example my wife has logged in for our new trip now i can only do it after my wife has triggered a password the height of completely unnecessary effort what is the point of this this app is also annoying when you are traveling because you are constantly asked for your login details you really wonder how such a large company can program such nonsense
if something is good you can say so
everything went to our complete satisfaction
great was no problem
flexible advice friendliness
i would have liked the service staff to have better german skills also the presence of germanspeaking tour guides from aida
cleaning is done at night and at am the vacuum cleaner is used to hit the furniture on deck loudly all balconies and verandas are affected a bar of chocolate as an quotapologyquot the next day the same thing only at am then at am the paper program for aida today is being saved apart from a few copies for which there is a search game around the theater you can look on your own cell phone or on the tv in your cabin or at the theater so that you get to the show on time unfortunately there are different times no consideration for older people who dont like to be on their cell phones all the time the last real quotservicequot is now being saved on aida initially on the cosma in the canaries there are no longer any transparent restaurant times no more paper program
great information and flight rebooking thanks to the strike at the airport
always my pleasure
i am satisfied with the evaluation
it doesnt get any better than with aida it was great again
it was almost perfect
everyone was very friendly and accommodating i felt comfortable
the staff is very nice
no comment
everything is good as always
the service staff was very friendly and helpful
everything was super organized at aida rating for almost everything
everything was super organized we have been on aida times and are looking forward to the th time
very good organization professional tour guides professional entertainment good food good information

on the whole expectations were met in terms of priceperformance ratio
aida is very customerfriendly and interested in ensuring that you have a good stay on board that will remain in your memory for a long time
we liked aida unfortunately some branded products like the good champagne are no longer available
we liked it very much
aida generally works very professionally reliably and customeroriented we are very satisfied
we enjoyed it once again very much
unfriendly overpriced poor hygiene and no offers andor help for single parents
good concept
on board aida you always feel very welcome the friendliness and competence of the employees is exemplary so that you look forward to seeing them again
great organization friendly clean just great
the whole package
everything was very well organized very nice staff
reliability friendliness service
everything was great anytime again
overall everything was great definitely again
priceperformance disappointing and customer service a disaster
a lot of effort is being made to make people happy especially in difficult times but priceperformance ratio should not be pushed to the limit
good service and very friendly staff except for a few men with white uniform jackets higher up in the hierarchy they occasionally had to demonstrate that they were better than others
unfortunately many disinfectant dispensers were empty as were many reserved loungers and sun loungers you have to sign for drinks with your finger which is unhygienic received incorrect information from the and sent to the wrong place unfortunately many young employees who have little idea and say the wrong things i have already been on a few aida trips but now i want to stay away from them aida has unfortunately gotten worse
unforgettable again and again great
very satisfied always well organized
everything was very good again and again
thank you and your team always happy with the aida
also offer a program for the seniors i really missed a drag show
aida with a great concept something for everyone especially young and old
covers all topics
the staff was almost always very friendly
its all ok
any weatherrelated problems or strikes that arose were handled very well
again and again
that was really beautiful
allround good service
when i contacted aida customer service today i was helped very competently patiently and friendly to correct a booking error that was entirely my own fault i am very grateful to the employee for the quick and uncomplicated solution the time on hold was moderate
comprehensive and timely information about what is missing here
impressive organization very friendly crew
very good shipping company everything top and almost without exception committed staff
what is communicated there fits
top shipping company top service
everything was perfect
room service was very friendly
i was able to relax well
ask once if you have reported problems and dont just try to silence the room boy with a stupid comment
i always feel well advised on the phone and on board see aida
please always pay attention to infection prevention families have a good offer
always my pleasure
questionnaire clearly structured easy to understand and quick to complete
quality of drinking water is capable of being revised
everything great

the complete aida concept
cheap offers
aida bella should improve overall
very nice service staff great suite you get what you get it used to be much better but the price and performance is right therefore just good and stars
it was all a round affair
that almost every chrome user always had a smile on their face no matter how they behaved or what they said
very versatile and you can really relax and there is something for everyone
beste supet aidadive als aidablu

work on yourself in every aspects it really comes from the heart revision your entire program and all the services you offer its really sad at the moment what is becoming with aida other providers are worlds ahead of you
everything was great for me
offers from hosts at impossible times service staff only some need training
organisation service quality offer
very family friendly recommended
all in all good but offers too expensive to use much
as always simply wonderful always happy to come back
good service friendly staff also when booking interesting routes pleasant holiday
aida has become significantly worse due to cost savings and has been doing so for years which many of our acquaintances have confirmed to us again and again
everything perfectly organized

i like the smaller ships sphinx class i hope they are in use and well looked after for a long time the new ones novacosma are too big for me and too focused on entertainment whats special about the sphinx class it doesnt have glass all around and youre closer to the sea
my expectations were all fulfilled
poor service on board no alternative compared to tui
the staff is friendly and helpful
great gym good food
currently on the bella the significant drop in quality compared to previous years is very noticeable from the kids club which at least doesnt have much to offer for the older kids to the quotno namequot supermarket ice cream used to be the excellent langnese premium ice cream you can feel everywhere that the controllers have taken the axe to cut costs since the prices have increased significantly at the same time whether for coffee spa drinks we dont think the overall package is right anymore we would only go on aida if there was a great offer otherwise mein schiff is now much better its a shame we used to think aida was unbeatable
aida is great weihrauh is her middle name
german language
everything around is organized and logical
i was and am very satisfied with the aida luna package

great customer service great service and staff top cleanliness great variety of food and drinks
find your own room on the first day nothing advertised in the hallways only by elevators wifi not good at all long wait for drinks
hi im currently on the prima and i have to say that aida has really gone downhill the internet doesnt work the tv doesnt work properly and the service is really bad waiting minutes to get something to drink is a disgrace the tables are dirty and that goes on for hours ive been traveling with aida for years but the country doesnt care anymore
everything was as i imagined kind regards adrian hodel

aida is super last but your loyal customers dont have to be left behind
everything was okay id be happy to come back
unfortunately poor service quality experienced
i will not do any more torture with aida
less paper clear overview no gifts in advance less is more quality
everything is great more electronic music please
helpfulness friendliness
great i can only recommend
germanspeaking travel provider with full service
all the best keep it up
aida has now run down nothing works tv is broken during the security film wifi breaks down constantly excessive prices for drinks and additional services bingo euros rude staff always the same food in trough form service restaurants fully booked months in advance unspeakable ordering process in the bars via the employees cell phones minutes for an inferior drink everything is just awful
great staff i love being on the aida everything under one roof
its always great to be on board and have this special feeling
never again id rather be on my ship and co times sooner
pretty much everything has deteriorated greatly from the service cleanliness and selection to the atmosphere mein schiff is much better in terms of the overall concept
gladly again
good value for money motivated staff professional management
we felt very comfortable
german language good food and drink
everything was great
we relaxed and celebrated our birthday we had nice contacts and are satisfied small problems were solved immediately
good experiences
thumbs up good overall concept
it was just great one goosebumps moment after another
as always a perfect allround carefree package
overall good
good day its a big company but the human touch is missing if you have a real problem unfortunately they just stick to the rules and dont try to find a solution its a shame
good organization cleanliness friendliness and excellent hospitality the service is simply top notch for those who appreciate good taste i recommend booking ai
everything was good
questions already answered or expressed
very professional clean and worth the price i would recommend the aida trip again and again
good value for money there is a lot on offer

if you dont book economy class it can be quite nice
organization very good except for departure bus if departure at am the bus should be available at am to reduce traffic jams because that causes stress for some people
help improve beni
friendly staff and good service on board arrival and departure room for improvement
everything to our complete satisfaction
it was always very nice
nice friendly and helpful staff
easy to use and smooth operation
a great entertainment program with a top dance teacher clean cabin
top from front to back
very good captain extensive information in the morning and evening
see questionnaire above
everything ok i would have liked to understand why they only speak german
that you didnt have to worry about anything

simply respond to guests wishes
i thought it was great that the staff with the best smiles got a prize they were all very nice
very good relaxed and interesting
the work of the service staff was very good the accompanying program of the artists still has room for improvement the work of the reception was particularly weak in some areas
too long too extensive i received the survey email before i was even home
xxxx xxxx xx
a good atmosphere
everything is good
dont reduce the service any further
in the hope that our data will be appreciated
carry on process criticism
it was varied
everything was perfect completely satisfied would do it again
i can give my personal opinion here
flexible hospitable service staff clean good fresh products
less than star is not possible but aida is not interested in this rating anyway
priceperformance ratio was good
i dont want to make a statement
top simply great
the questionnaire was simple

good information and organization
everything is great
schiffreise
everything is great thank you
unfortunately the things that are important to you are not asked there are too few opportunities to enter free text or to explain the rating
aida offers something for every age group
complete relaxation from start to finish
very nice staff everyone very polite
the overall concept fits
good entertainment you feel like youre coming home
alright youre welcome
it was a new positive experience what we had with sida

aida stella review simply a super show program
waiting times when entering singapore of hours

everything was well organized and an experience
oasis of wellbeing great service friendly staff helpful with a smile
aida is number for me but improvements are also possible
once aida always aida
pretty perfect and inexpensive overall performance most recently on aidamar weeks of wonderful relaxation the highlight of the show was wayne morris it was unbelievable how he made the hall shake the audience went wild and didnt want to let him go
the allround package at aidacosma is perfect just try it out
you had the feeling as if you had been on board for much longer relaxation was a complete success
we have recovered poorly
aida love love love
aida is reliable guestoriented and predictable
aida tries very hard but you cant please everyone unfortunately if you have a complaint there is no one to contact or you never hear anything about it again
recovery new locations
consideration and above all help and support for people with disabilities in all areas
who is trustpilot
everything was great
there is little that aida could improve
the evening program could be expanded to be much more diverse
understandable texts
was very well organized
excellent organization was fully satisfied
poor organization

price and performance
great staff very friendly and helpful but all around in all areas
dedicated service staff
neat and tidy service nice clean ship excellent service

room service
everything was great gladly again
great service
the guest is the focus
improve your internet so that it works for more than hours a day make sure there are enough sun loungers and chairs
you learn too many negative things that are not to be taken lightly
we are aida junkies apart from a few minor bumps everything was perfect
anytime again as soon as we can better than expected
everything fine
promises must be kept at all costs
simply aida addicted thank you for everything
aida is simply great everything on board is perfect from a to z keep it up
and liked everything very much
all right
no idea i have no experience
corona outbreak and no information thats my assessment toilets in poor condition and often filthy
from checkin to checkout all you had to do was feel good
i had none
everything very well organized very friendly staff and very clean
no idea what to rate here
you can speak all the languages in the world but if you dont speak german its not for you
my experiences with aida have been simply excellent again and again
i like aidas overall offering
excellent organization competent staff best quality at all levels
do not arrange departure through a contracted company but rather through aida itself do not send people to the airport too early on departure disco noise must be significantly reduced
remembering their old values
learn new things and relax
it was fantastic
sometimes the translation is missing for foreign language announcementsstatements otherwise satisfied
days full of momentsthanks to the whole team
antalyseychellen
everything is very good there are small drawbacks everywhere stars would be the right rating
all in all we were more than satisfied with everything aida offers
it can be even better aida
very good company with a very good atmosphere

all wishes and expectations have been fulfilled
very satisfied
very good value for money great food good service
bring the quality back to the level it was
always very satisfied with aida satisfaction begins at checkin
i cant think of anything at the moment
quotrate your experiencequot quotdescribe your experiencequot please what what exactly should i rate here i have just filled out and sent off the aida questionnaire should i rate the questionnaire now or the survey itself perhaps you could add a little more context here descriptive nouns so to speak the aida questionnaire itself is unfortunately very impractical no page numbers are shown x of y you cant go back everywhere especially not at the end because you cant fill in the free text field further up and there is only one field available for it at the end ps the check mark further down with quoti look forward to email updatesquot seems wrong the aida questionnaire explicitly states that the survey is anonymous i cant see an email address field here either has anyone even looked at this form
very great experience gladly again
keep it up and dont let up
reliability and above all consistency in service amp quality
i had a drinks package and everything was correctly accounted for but now i dont and i have to check every day my partner pays with her card and the drinks are on my bill i cant explain it
it was great
great organization hats off
the questions are not precise enough
just wow from a to z great ship great staff super organization well see you again
very friendly staff great ship high standard
sauna should remain free longer port stay new show queen abba are nice but if youve seen them three or four times thats enough
service and route were perfect
very good entertainment and social interaction
short and sweet
once aida always aida there is no need to write more it really is great on board
priceperformance ratio absolutely ok would do it again anytime
friendliness good organization
aida can do many things better than its competitors

in the past you got more for your money
i was temporarily somewhat disabled due to an operation and received assistance everywhere
sometimes very good sometimes chaotic
we have recovered well
organization is really top
priceperformance on the aidanova is top countless bars and restaurants great facilities good service
toolllllllll as always
i am very satisfied with aida
the organization and concept are great the staff sometimes seem tired and demotivated
overall good but aida charges a princely sum for everything
the company is very flexible it is able to make restructuring measures immediately guests on aida should be able to make full use of every opportunity to enjoy their wellbeing
its all olay
years ago it was great now its terrible quality has gone downhill and theres only quantity instead of quality they cash in but dont offer anything anymore
everything was great would definitely come again
everything was very good except no bundesliga including liga with bundesliga again gladly
many frequent drivers everything is too boring however proven concept but not designed for older audiences
very good service and very good performance menu plentiful quality very good very large selection of dishes very clean price performance is good
anyone who did not feel comfortable here was damaged in their perception all members were very helpful
good concepts
everything perfect
hggcggjjhjjhh
mostly very friendly staff now we just need to work on getting some of the staff to smile and then it will be fine
good priceperformance ratio relaxed in good quality
it is a well organized company
i will come back
once aida always aida
very good service friendliness of the staff
one word is enough perfect
it was a great experience i would do it again
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
all in all pleasant
appointment postponed without my knowledge
everything is great and almost perfect
it was a complete success i was able to switch off completely
clean good and friendly
goes so far everything is overcrowded and with queues
delighted with everything
aida is trying but sometimes problems are not solved but only answered superficially this lacks appreciation of the guest
friendly helpful staff and good value for money
very good service
onsite support help with problems
great service and good experiences
stressfree holiday very friendly staff
very familyfriendly very good food great activities and opportunities on board and on land great value for money and great always friendly staff

cabin great staff very helpful evening program fantastic
i can only recommend it maybe not necessarily on holiday if you can all the staff are very friendly
first skeptical then enthusiastic
we have only had good experiences with aida so far
everything was top notch again period
very well equipped staff is sometimes too few or overwhelmed
it was a really great experience and a great experience the staff was really really nice everything was super clean the team was perfectly trained i felt really comfortable thank you id be happy to come again
unfortunately there are no zero stars one star for wellness and massages very bad service long waiting times family ship aida cosma
once aida always aida
simply allround service only recommended
again and again
aida is good value for money but the onboard prices are increased in small steps several times a year
super organisation
if im assigned a cabin where the elevator goes down from the bar and theres a clinking and clattering all night long and then im told at reception that if the problem occurs again i should report it then i feel like ive been ripped off
cxxxxx vgghjj bbchh
the checkin works well and everything is well planned unfortunately the service leaves a lot to be desired and the extra costs should not be underestimated
everyone is very friendly everyone on the crew knows their way around
unfortunately a request for a rebooking was immediately recorded as a rebooking of course they just put me off by phone and i havent received a response by email for over two weeks i am more than disappointed i really cant recommend the service this will probably be my last aida trip
nd time aida in the autumn holidays kiel oslo with daughter years we were all very impressed again except for the wifi
mostly satisfied especially with the staff
great would come again see hoi
aida is slowly getting back to precorona levels
all in all i was satisfied
the process and the company are all great the new cosma isnt great its better to get prima or perla
everything is perfectly organized at aida everything works very well and everything runs smoothly i can only recommend aida
visited great ports
organization friendliness of the persona
the staff is great very customeroriented i was completely satisfied

verry good when what to ge fuckt by te color then you are on the right spot lying people maybe orders by the comagny to do so dithy rooms with camera in the room to watch you
do not pull on colorline i warn you especially muslim families you really are not welcome there the staff are terribly rude this is not a family place with children only for alcoholics stay at home we got very ugly looks at the buffet and they took the glasses away from the table only because we didnt buy drinks there is no free water wifi internet is very expensive
terribly bad customer service color line sometimes operates with offer codes for general use but there are only so many places on these codes when you ask for help about how this works you get the answer that this is not in use even though there are several people who have booked trips with this code the lady i spoke to was also rude
i traveled with color line magic to kiel last week and managed to forget my ear plugs again in the cabin which i am sure of as they were only used in the cabin and i remember exactly where i put them when i contact color line they say they were not found in the cabin obviously the dishonest cleaning staff took them as no one else could have been in the room after i left the room and before they arrived
tragic company i was going to book a trip and got as far as filling in payment information and confirming payment then i was told that an error had occurred and i had to start all over again when i did they had more than doubled the price talk about good customer service
impossible to get anyone to answer the phone no one calls back as promised totally unacceptable dont understand that it is not possible to have a booking system such as eg airlines have changes and cancellations on the website where is the problem bad but definitely not service
traveled with color fantasy august was quite surprised at how bad the cleanliness was in my stateroom on the ninth floor the cleaner here should be ashamed it was dirty with nasty stains all over it didnt give a good experience and i think it was disgusting in the morning to take a shower thereshrug
was supposed to be called back without losing my place in the queue after hours i still havent been called back i try to call them again and after i am hung up on terrible customer service answers to emails can take a week and in a week it may be too late
i ask that in the future you go out with ads that can be trusted to go out with a car package price of that only applies to special times has dynamic pricing and applies per person i perceive as pure peasant capture shame on you
an emoji says more than words waited hours with youth groups in over degree heat because of incorrect information from colorline pretty unfriendly rejection at the terminal in hirtshals
color line magic bed bugs infestation in the rooms bed bugs dirty rooms with bed bugs the bed sheets and duvets are full of stains simply disgusting got bitten by bed bugs i have photos too
it does not measure up that you can only make extra orders on quotmy sidequot while you have to set aside half the day to queue at customer service if you have to make other types of changes to the order after all we live in
do you really want to get annoyed then call the color line hotline for example to change a trip or cancel it due to illness you might be on hold for minutes if you havent given up before then and after minutes still no one answers the phone
a coronarelated cancellation at the end of may after an email and hotline calls there is still no money at the beginning of october original quote at the time it will be quotpaid immediatelyquot addition today october nd the money arrived after weeks the rating remains at one point
have paid for membership but cannot use this when the rest of the family is going on a trip requests multiple memberships per family at nok customer club is free at fjordline
expensive and bad the worst is the customer service over the phone rebooking is only possible over the phone extremely timeconsuming and annoying you should take a look at stenaline instead they are better in every respect
one star is too much really bad customer service i have repeatedly tried to contact but you just hang on the phone for several hours and they dont respond to email contact
everything is fine but if you buy extra internet for reception when i have no network the internet is very slow
bad service and harassing staff at color hybrid stay away
impossible to get in touch with put on hold for half an hour how hard can it be to pick up the phone
casino on both fantasy and magic are the most rigged stuff i have ever played on stay away
always easy going booking bording etc very helpful customer service everything great
its been resolved the refund has been received
impossible to get hold of does not respond to inquiries
advertise with prices that are not found on their websites
refund process for a coronarelated cancellation by colorline is catastrophic
pleasant service good service
customer service will not help the gift card voucher has just expired and customer service will not help it is of course the customers own responsibility to keep an eye on the expiry date but there was a shelf life of less than months
dinner service excellent and friendly other service very good neat and fast vehicle assistance with securing engines properly room tidy assistance in the hall also friendly applies to outward and return journeys very well organised thank you
of the four customs officers were very friendly as well as all border inspectors the staff on board were also excellent
good loading of cars and very comfortable premier lounge only lost a star as no newspapers or magazines on board
very good service and everything well arranged time schedules are held very precise as well nice choice of activities both in and outside if the weather allows that for all ages
perfect friendly people organized verry well we will come back
nothing to say easy and immediate online purchase and the journey on board was perfect
polite face to face dealing when leaving the uk little bit more straight faced on return leg and a lot slower process at the window
we had what we expected a few more informations in understandeble english would be nice
easy and punctual crossing pleasant crew nice clean environment on board
right on time clear routing and pleasant crossing
super easy to order as you got very good help over the phone very pleasant to talk to and felt that you were well taken care of thanks for your help miriam
nothing good delay prices too expensive staff not very nice or welcoming on board in short to avoid if you have the choice
great customer service made booking very easy very responsive and helpful to any kind of special requests great travel expereince as well

when ordering a table for the buffet by phone we were asked by the employee to hand over all the information on our credit card incl check digits for payment in advance we naturally refused this the employee will then send a link for payment why on earth is the employee asking this it goes against all sense dfds should train their staff better
everything is excellent and want to have a trip again i hope to get some offer from dfds
everyone was so polite and helpful im in a wheelchair and if i could give you more stars i would thank you
the edge of the bed is much to high it hurts your legs in bathroom are no cups no little towel to dry your hands kind employers good food

it was amazing perfectly
i bought a bottle of water and a bag of chips from their store and was charged dkk they claim that i also bought a jacket that doesnt fit i have written many emails to them asking them to look at their own video surveillance but they refuse to do so i feel like ive been cheated
your time travel sucks

rooms are crean staff very helpful
we had a lot of fun and a good time on board
twice the price as before covid otherwise ok
a little delayed but overall a good service and experience
for bicycles the only bike racks available are spoke breakers it is better to take a tensioning strap with you and negotiate with the staff whether you can tie your bike to the side it is urgently necessary to invest in decent bike racks
the staff were very helpful and friendly

trustpilots are unreliable companies that are not registered with trustpilots hang out
i am on a vegan diet and got such a great help and service from the kitchen staff thank you
all good on time clean and reasonable price
the cashier has scanned our items incorrectly i bought a bottle of water and chips but she has charged me dkk unfortunately we didnt notice the mistake until we returned i sent them an email the next day and they replied that in addition to chips and water i also bought a jacket for dkk which i have never done thanks for the answer i have already sent three emails but i have not received a reply yet
i have been selling trips for dfds on my website through their affiliate program with tradedoubler in april i sold trips worth around to my big surprise dfds then denied me my share a few days ago tradedoubler gave me the following reason unfortunately dfds had to cancel several of their sales due to fraud and you sales were included in the batch of the cancelled orders i sold all the trips and now they dont want to pay me my share with a bogus fraud excuse it seems very unlikely and like a statistical impossibility that all the trips which different people bought coming from my website were all fraud be warned and stay away from their affiliate program it is a total scam very dishonest company and i think the only ones committing fraud in this case is dfds edit dfds is now trying to make my review disappear from trustpilot by demanding nonexistent information like order numbers
the cleaning of the room was not in order there was visible dust on panels and the floor for example in the tax free shop i experienced unpleasant behavior with an employee the cashier scans our item she can see there is a mistake on the price she then addresses a colleague this colleague says it is not a mistake i point out that their signage is incorrect if applicable she will check up on the price meanwhile the cashier tries to correct the price she says she cant remember how to do it at the same time she asks if i can remember the price i cant but offer to go down and check it out i go down to check the price in this connection the colleague comes walking after me and tells me to take it easy that i should probably get it at a discounted price i do not understand this comment and the search in general i refer to the conversation with the cashier which i find is simply swept away i do not understand why i had to be approached in this way and why i went back was not listened to
the personel from the desk at the th floor was very helpfull in providing us with a room were i could install my cpap machine more easy upgrade they succeeded both ways they were also helpfull with wifi i also saw a lot of personel being helpfull with suitcases at stairs they looked especially out for elderly people and children we also booked breakfast it was very nice we also heard that the lady who was providing kids with information about sealife was very nice and informative
very friendly and helpful employees at the terminal
always reliable service no problem if turning up early staff always friendly
it was very nice
checkin was quick and smooth the crossing was on time the staff was very friendly everything was perfect
very good competent and very friendly telephone advice and errorfree implementation of the rebookings t
discount on tickets

this is a money machine where you have to be careful about accepting their socalled quotoffersquot after hours you are stuck at the time which cannot be changed you do not get the money back and you are greeted with a superior message that everything is written in fine print on their website your answer is not good enough few people read a page travel condition change your information when ordering and canceling
everything was very good as always its a pity there is no program for many users private people it would be a big incentive to book even more
good and clean ant staff are very helpful

the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness on board are positive
a but you must sign the seats for blue badge holders
the lady in the premium lounge was soooooo friendly she made a very good job and made us feel very welcome
top processing but unfortunately a totally dirty terminal
when you walk with great difficulty like me the bathroom with the raised floor is very unpractical to get in and out on a rolling vessel
everything was again well arranged by dfds and all employees were very friendly and helpful just like previous times
once booked it becomes impossible to discover refund arrangements for cancellations i lost not great is it
ive just watched on social media a video of one of your drivers attempting to physically attack an amateur photographer stood on a public pavement because the photographer was lawfully taking pictures of the drivers dfds hgv lorry an absolute thug if it wasnt for the swift intervention by security guards at the scene his attack would have carried on even when he got back into your lorry he continued to make threats i teach mma mate ill be back in minutes does this thug represent the ethos values and professionalism of your organisation do you feel it is safe for the public when you have somebody with clear anger management issues driving a ton lorry with your logo on the side disgraceful and criminal behaviour
service all around was good very satisfied
just seen a video of one of there drivers getting aggressive and threatening towards a member of public not good
perfekt i and my dog was very happy thank you
just watched dfds driver threatening a member of public for filming outside lineage absolutely disgusting behaviour dj audits on you tube watch yourself this aggressive man should be disciplined
this review only concerns the booking process and the cancellation that unfortunately had to be made for personal reasons the booking process was clear and problemfree the cancellation was also completely transparent and the refund was in my account after just days it couldnt be better
as allways all staff polite and friendly dfds are great and i have used the others
leanne who is employed in group booking department is fantastic always has very fast response times and has arranged our work experience over the last years we always have a great experience on board the king where work experience for our students is always very well organised a fantastic team of staff are always available on board with great facilities for all passengers the vessel is always very clean and tidy with staff working around the clock to better the passenger experience at all times once we arrive in ijmuiden the professional service continues with safe travel to amsterdam city centre where you can see how local life spent in netherlands transport is arranged back to vessel where a professional service is always delivered upon return to north shields terminal value for money is outstanding on this short break for all people and is well recommended
the check ins are quick the crossings hopefully smooth with a quick disembark process would always welcome special offers or discounts please
staff very helpful all areas clean an enjoyable experience
customer service is exceptional and a lounge facility is excellent
overall a very good experience good service and entertainment now i am not a parent of small children anymore but it is really good to see that there is room for them and that they are also entertained
perfect for a short break

the whole experience was good but we had commodore rooms said free wifi but we only got hours of it and on the way back we didnt get anything i lost my paper sheet with the wifi code on went to the reception and asked if they could help me which they gave me a new sheet of paper but on that sheet of paper it said commodore on the other sheet of paper it said something else which the duration on that paper was hours so i feel its a bit bad if you get only hours of wifi dont say you get free wifi other then that it was great
best value crossing very efficient at both ports friendly staff
hi the journey to oslo was a disaster i booked hours of wifi very poor transmission our roommates broke glasses and left them in the hallway they were loud all night and spit in the hallway

great service nice people good price
on time easy crossing helpful staff
friendly staff and plenty of entertainment
lovely staff really friendly and helpful
good trip welcoming staff only reason for stars instead of is the crappy app that most of all refers directly to a website that doesnt have the answers we were looking for for example when we sat in our cabin and wondered when the tax free shop would close we couldnt find that
friendly staff and very adaptable in arranging an earlier crossover very good one tip how about some sleeping chairs
efficient and convenient reliable service
we had the best of times staff wonderful thank you so much x
please do not use this company for your own sake the service is horrible worst i have ever experienced unclean

perfect crossing as usual staff were super helpful throughout trip
easy reasonable price
everything seems fine but it makes a terrible noise when the bow thruster is running you are thoroughly awakened in frederikshavn
its the second time i have used this company its always been very good and the staff are super polite
on time efficient travel as simple as that
everywhere good service full satisfaction from here
from check in to driving off the staff are helpful and friendly where ever i can i will only use dfds we used the relax lounge on the way out and the premier lounge on the return the premier lounge was the winner and we enjoyed the experience the hostess was fantastic and made us feel very welcome every trip so far has been great

delayed and no communication once at the port will always use the tunnel from now on
in every respect friendly and accommodating staff
super satisfied across the board extra credit to the staff for the service on board in the premium lounge
debording in dieppe and new haven takes much to much time staff is very friendly
your booking page is really annoying i was on your homepage with different browsers i couldnt make a reservation request i actually wanted to secure the early bird discount
good service somewhat lacking info from the bridge bad bunk lamps
friendly staff in premium lounge with improvements to the lounge on the way
it was very good and organized only the check and immigration queues take a long time you organize yourself with a schedule and you leave to hours later more staff and wonderful service
punctual clean professional and friendly staff
good food and experience top notch
poor customer service poor communication avoid waste off time
clearly identified signs to check in easy and quick check in paying for lounge is worth it if you want to sleep or rest without chaos everywhere

good service cleanliness comfortable beds everything worked without any games in the arcadia all very pro and nice shampoosoap in the room wc
nice journey lovely coffee friendly staff good choice at duty free
a company in decline you can clearly feel they are under pressure the way they treat their customers the methods border on the illegal and the customer service is decidedly rude really feel sorry for those who work in such a climate deserves no people practice for a round i give it to before dfds is bankrupt unfortunately im pretty sure in my case
all great premium lounge great fish and chips great love you guys have great christmas and happy new year
it was my first journey with dfds very impressive great atmosphere good food good music and good service thumbs up
you dont get the last star because out of our team of men with each of our cabins didnt have a tv you just have to tighten it up but otherwise everything is just fine as always
having used dfds for about the last years the service was fine except for the usual problem how long it takes to disembarque at either end
friendly staff and helpfull and great service og smiler allthough its a busy season
terrible company terrible customer service they fiddle and cheat wherever they can makes customers buy things they dont need customer service does not listen to customers it probably wont be long before their methods appear in the media unfortunately otherwise cool concept just needs a little more credibility
everything worked so smoothly and the staff with whom i interested were all courteous and extremely helpful
super good experience needs a little cleaning in the toilets but not the last time we come
mega good experience it wont be the last time
we used the premium lounge both ways which was good value for money smooth crossings despite gale force winds
well organized and staff are friendly attentive and helpful
everything was great clean friendly and on time
customer service focus rebooking was great support
everything
very nice staff who do their best for you
it was a great weekend for this offer
everything perfect super helpful and competent staff clean and a pleasure at comedore
reece on live chat support was phenomenal i was stressed trying to ensure i could travel out of the schengen zone on time with my dog helped with a billing issue so i could pay at the port instead and answered all my questions hopefully the rest of the trip is just as great
nice professional experience from checkin to checkout delicious food and drink and happy entertainment
going out was really good but really upset that we were put on p o coming back dont know whybut would go with them again
very smooth from booking to getting back to the uk very helpful staff
every thing
we found the staff very helpful very organised and very polite
i think the staff are really nice and welcoming on top of that there were people in the store who helped me with my phone when i had problems with it
chat bot was good as couldnt get through on phone to change booking after car accident also the addition of pets not intuitive on website had to pay adminstration fee for that omission
the reclining chairs are a bit tired now and want updating staff friendly as usual pleasant crossings
journey on time as always happy friendly staff and good value for money
easy good price on time
good service and extremely good management
paid for a cabin with tv but of the channels didnt work i just want to clarify that its not the number of channels but the functionality dr ramajang works but dr with flicker tvnews works but tv doesnt work the signal is the problem not the number of channels
okokokok
good service and great price very easy to book online and simple to make amendments
as usual very efficient service good price and helpful staff
good foodon timegreat experience again
great staff good service
nice staff and good food on board but the mattress could really use changing you can clearly feel the springs wake up at night because it hurts
everything exactly according to schedule friendly staff
just wanted to praise the exceptional customer service of connor in the contact centre we had to move our travel dates to delays and bad weather he was able to put our minds at ease about having to change dates he remained calm even with a screeching child in the background he helped us move dates finding an incredible new deal for us and going above and beyond thank you customer service like yours is so very rare these days i would definitely recommend dfds based upon my experiences thanks also to samantha on chat who was really helpful sorry we got cut off my connection dropped charlie for sorting out a quick query
all perfect fast and economical
efficient effective and easy both crossings departedarrived a bit late though
as always good timing excellent service as always
actually everything is good except internet connection because how much is paid it is more without internet than with it now you are going to say that it is telenor that operates the network but again it is you who sell that service
on time both ways lovely crew all in all a good experience
wasnt advisable but disappointed
pleasant and pleasant staff on board good atmosphere lots of fun for children
best company
i love crossing the channel with dfds great price and very convenient experience onboard
easy booking easy alterations and excellent customer service thank you so much
syper have a nice trip with a good team on board
i wish there was a free internet network because internet trays cost a lot
easy and flexible friendly staff
all that was needed with friendly service
on time the cte dopale is very smart the cte des dunes less so
everything was good as a regular traveller using dfds i always enjoy the experience thanks
method of handling only staff who do not speak dutch

excellent service from all members staff
on time great bar relaxed breakfast decent
good service in shops and restaurants friendly pets
great food on board great customer service from the friendly staff rooms spotlessly clean almost no sleep though as the rooms are stiflingly hot despite the air conditioning and beds uncomfortable entertainer in the bar should be put quietly out of his misery guitar playing is perfectly good but his voice woeful given the number of musicians in the uk desperate for work and recognition surely dfds could do better
old broken and dirty interior but friendly staff
swift and easy experence comfortable channel crossing

great company on time clean helpful crewnice experience thanks
very helpful staff excellent service thank you
if the staff were friendly there would be stars
super sweet and friendly staff nothing is too much
good handling service and friendliness
being able to move our crossing smoothly and quickly to an earlier date super service on board in the premium lounge
if you follow the instructions everything is nice and easy these people have a protocol and rules to follow so theres no point to argue personally i have been treated fairly and equally
personel tried their best but the vessel is old and outdated a lick of paint can only cover up so much
getting too expensive to use for crossing newhaven to dieppe
got fantastic service and help from maria thank you very much
met exclusively serviceminded and competent personnel
neatly kept to the agreements my back was bothering me i was given hot water for my jug and i rested undisturbed on a couch and on the floor so good service
dinner ok breakfast great
satisfied very much i am we are all happy
the telephone booking to dieppe from in france is simply awful with the phones not connecting dieppe dfds recognise this but do nothing to improve the service email service is slow and only superficially helpful as only very basic information is given and no helpful guidance not the advertised service
booking is easy and the are always helpful

fluent checkin and good staff no problems
everything went without any problems definitely worth repeating
well run accommodation staff helpful and friendly
excellent service travelling by motorcycle
i have received incredibly good service and help from astera in relation to my booking as some things had to be changed she has really put in a great effort and provided a sublime service and also responded super quickly i give my to astera
dirty old inventory very old no way to clean the toilet disgusting no hairdryer bed linen torn dog toilet stinks of urine disgusting far too few exercise areas for so many dogs and no wifi or television for a hour journey even coffee shops etc only open for a short time
always great service and easy when on motorcycles

fantastic service when i called fir booking all wishes were fulfilled
on time clean and pleasant really enjoyable
we used the premium lounge in both directions the advertised price was per person the amount charged was per person delays in departure and arrival both directions otherwise a good service
everything worked according to plan good service both on board and at checkin
hours waiting they probably want us to go for shopping on duty free shop
the way in which you handle booking and tickets is splendid once the online form is filled in you can go
the crew was fantastic everything about it was brilliant thank u very much x
great service no issues
the right information and smoothly on board and off again
speedy loading unloading comfortable surroundings onboard refreshments priced reasonably
wifi was unstable it was annoying otherwise everything fine
good planning process and travel information the app is relatively pointless as it contains neither communication with the customer changes detailed information eg on how to get there nor the booked additional services eg the booked restaurant visits the request to arrive at the terminal earlier than communicated when booking came much too late as it was on the day of arrival this information must be provided the day before
good service from all employees
as usual fantastic holiday smiling staff can only recommend you
bad getting on and off by bike too little space for a bicycle
in the chat i was met by an incredibly welcoming woman who was very helpful in getting my booking together instead of having them divided into two i know im a sucker for such things but the fact that she just helps me with a very patient mind is really commendable
rearranging a return date and time was easy very good choices on the menu only issue was the gents toilet was rather smelly checking in was smooth and easy
it did what i wanti got there
helloim taking on my journey premium lounge where is always good service only this time was not available toilet in room but all others thing was perfect
outstanding customer service from liz was extremely patient answered all my questions with enthusiasm and cleared up any concerns really went above and beyond id give more stars if i could msg to the manager give the lady a raisepromotion
very good organization checkin service on board cleanliness and speed were impressive
good exaggerated price for our dog while absolutely nothing planned for him
well organized and scheduled though te ship itself is quite old now it is stil comfortable
overall very friendly and helpful staff
great service regarding cancellation and storms ship fine the service staff at the top
it was a great experience everything was ao great
very friendly and helpful staff we felt being welcome from the first moment
dfds spams your mailboxes afterwards for a good trustpilot review unnecessary annoying and waste of time
good service and good rooms however a minus with the sheets too small and there was a stain you could tell that it had not been changed but otherwise satisfied
great all round super friendly staff and cleanliness is the main thing though

dfds bounced us up to commodore since we just got married it was such a nice gesture thanks a lot
service communication very good
the dog could stay in the car the dog run before departure needs a lot of improvement more green space
everything was well organised nice experience
by far the best way to visit the uk staff well trained and friendly

fast checkin early boarding very nice staff
i think there should be free wifi for everyone
improved efficient safe loading and unloading of vehicles we are regular returning clients for this route
ive always had a pleasant experience with dfds the only issue i have is the state of the rest rooms onboard there should be signs up explaining how to use the button and flush system
all really good
efficient very helpful and frindly people easy to deal with the only thing that could be adressed is the qs for a coffee
clean easy check in and kind people
good offers fooddrinks shopping and good service on board
good crossing could do with some air con
friendly staff good journey
you stole my money i want my back in my account as promised that was i want my money you took from me and will not give back dfds hides behind emails faceless corporate corrupt organisation james weir be careful with dfds
they write on the website that the ticket can be changed when we wanted to do this the amount for the change is not approved but writes that the bank has canceled the amount we tried several of our visa cards to different banks but the website kept writing the same then i wanted to call and get help all the phone numbers didnt work but one referred to the website i write to them but they come with an immediate autoreply and if i need more help they will get back in a few days mmmmmm its just not right
great crossing and good on deck parking for motorbikes
everything was top

clear information everything was correct
does what it says gets you and the car safely over the channel for a reasonable price definitely not luxury but you get what you pay for
everything worked very smoothly as always but i cant understand the doubling of prices even with the best will in the world i know that everything has become more expensive but price doubling thats why i only gave it stars
excellent from start to finish priority boarding premium lounge disembarkation all excellent and smooth
toilets need more at toon to cleaning not just a floor wipe and mop each cubicle needs checks for wipes and flush after users dirty behaviour bars need more staffing at peak times as queues are unacceptable to disabled passengers provision needed for disabled users who are unable to stand for long periods
clean punctual friendly crew excellent promotional prices in shop
a pleasant crossing very friendly service staff always happy to come back
i regularly go with dfds and have never had any complaints so far
dfds have absolutely no idea how to load motorcycles safely we were all put leaning to left tight up against a wall motorcycle straps have to pull down on the left and you couldnt get there because of the wall so everyone had to strap pulling the opposite way zero interest or help from the staff either we were all left to our own devices in a hot hold very very stressful
easy to book everything went as agreed nothing unusual

no service in the premium lounge had to ask multiple times to get what was advertised for premium lounge and made to feel like an inconvenience to staff for asking
everything went smoothly from start to finish all on time and everything clean
i am honestly shocked at how you treat your customers at dfds normally im actually a fairly understanding person but i really feel that ive been cheated and i find it very unethical when several thousand kroner are involved

we booked for two adults bike but apparently that meant adults and bike so we had to pay an additional one way for a second bike booking online for bikes is not really user friendly now i know it but it was a costly learning proces
i use dfds monthly and service is always on point and help is on hand all the time

it all worked fine despite some language issues with some of the crew no complaints however would use dfds again

i think it is so scammy that i have several times tried to order one of their minicruises via a biospil code which in the last step of the payment rejects my payment to tell me that quotsuddenly there is no availabilityquot and raises the price from dkk which it cost via the campaign to dkk or dkk conveniently this happens several times as i try to use my winning promo codes
good customer service i was able to amend my booking easily the flexible option was very good
really nice thank you
why do u not have a lyalry program i travel with you at least x per month and there is no loyalty program i work for lexus customer experience pls introduce a program i would sign up immediately or presell discounted bundled tickets my email kind regards ps this is the second time i have suggeated this to you my mobile
i am trying to order a product to enhance the experience on my cruise that you recommend and advertise with vip kit when i call you no one knows about the product and it is not something you can order anymore due to lack of updating of the website nor can you offer anything else similar but only one of the other products i honestly thought it was super bad customer service as it is not me who should make you aware of an unupdated website in order to be put at a disadvantage it must clearly be up to you
thank you for perfect service
polite courteous efficient and on time thank you
excellent staff excellent facilities and all great value loved the whole experience

brutal attack absolutely no stars wouldnt let me post without least hitting where do i start my son along with lads who work abroad and travel back and forth every week for work to munich as they are electrical engineers all married men with families had their room door kicked in by the companies drunken security and physically dragged out the room by the feet my son who by the way was sound asleep in the top bunk jumped out his bed startled when their door was kicked in had his feet tie wrapped handcuffed and knee restraints put on and was taken away and beat up and put in a cell all night as i said my son was fast asleep in his bed when they came in even after the other two tried to push a ladder against the door to stop them which we have video evidence of the police have been notified of this incident and the year old is currently in hospital for treatment of serious injuries whilst the other two have head wounds cuffmark cuts and battered and bruised disgraceful behaviour by the companies members of staff this was reported first thing by one of the men and myself but was told they couldnt investigate till tomorrow as they only had staff in today shocking as i had stated to him that i was reporting a serious criminal offence this is a legitimate review and will be taken the full way but please if you are thinking of using this company please think again this review should not be removed my son is laying in hospital in a serious condition because geordie security guards used his head like a football and were kicking into every part of him they could have killed him then said if you dont say anything we will let you off the boat i need someone from their company who actually cares to call me date of experience march
dfds offer really great value particularly on the newhavendieppe route they load swiftly and if they are running a little late rare they do everything they can to make up the time
good price all on time and very clean cabins everything was perfect thanks
check in man was very helpful everyone from loading to on board staff were friendly
it was a good experience from initial phone call to book until getting off in dieppe thank you
security guards attacked men my husband being one the men who were attacked all have young families at home who are now in a state due to this horrific attack and were in hospital receiving treatment am sunday morning security attacked my husband and his colleagues whilst on board heading from amsterdam to newcastle handcuffing restraining kicked down stairs choked to the point of passing out is just a few of the things that these thug security guards did unprovoked attack dfds should be appalled at who they have employed this is going further but to think security on board are there to keep you safe

we were a party of three with three bicycles i had to make three separate bookings to add the bicycles as you can only have one bicycle per booking my daughters booking had to be done via a premium rate line see how stenna line do it stenna very quick slick dfds stressful and unnecessarily time consuming and expensive
during the oslogtfrederikshavn crossing it turned out at the end of the crossing that we had lost approximately in network costs because the phone had been switched to their network without a clear notification i call that pure piracy
great service the whole process was very straightforward with friendly staff and no queues whatsoever a
the dfdspensiocoecommerce website is unsafe no encryption so its impossible to book a ticket online
easy to book easy to board love the premier lounge just wish children under a certain age were restricted from entry or have a seperate lounge for families

great trip staff where helpful will be going again with dfdf
it was superb stars
i am trying to call them to amend a bookings route they have charged me for being half an hour in the queue and my credit dropped to zero when i was finally in position number one though i was aware of the p charge per minute naively i did not think it was applied to being in a queue moreover i was waiting for half an hour to change from position number to number which makes me only think that they have single agent managing all calls if you cant keep your calls free why not creating an amendment service online
unfortunately the worst experience in terms of customer service cant recommend
spent euro at the vending machine and it didnt give me my drink waste of money
the only problem was i wonted to change the return but the phone lines are closed on the weekend my be you could have a number just for the weekend
excellent service thank you
everything perfect
very good clean
ok update someone has now emailed me to say they can reinstate my ticket so i can change the date and keep my options open it hasnt happened yet though when it does ill update further maybe trustpilot made this happen previously i wrote dfds fail to give clear information i booked a premium ticket which i could change date or refund if needed i was informed of the date to cancel now they are not giving me my refund or answering my attempts to call help i need to speak to someone dfds does not reply their phones dont answer please get in touch this is stressful and unfair i do not recommend dfds
very good efficient service would definitely use the company again

very good service very straightforward we will keep on using dfds
lovely crossing staff really helpful and it was a pleasant experience
efficient and well run service staff polite and helpful
first time on dfds and will not be the last excellent facilities on board excellent helpful and friendly staff that were all working together the food was very good quality and quantity good value for money nice to have the duty free shop available where you park the only slight downside was no caf available while waiting but this was not a major problem
superb from start to finish friendly staff and assistance with getting vehicles on and off barman very good on board
awful response time when trying to book a group of doffs said they couldnt help and to look on the website there is no way to book a group on the website further more when waiting on hold i have now been charged and they put the phone down awful service
efficient friendly service as usual ill be back
they are very slow to respond to requests and you wont get a penny back if you need to cancel i was not impressed
being on hold for so long on a premium rate phone number to speak to an agent has given me enough time to log onto trustpilot and leave this stinking review
i bought leather sofa for which i paid fortune the sofa is worst quality sofa leather got discoloured with in years dfs has not provided any help even if the concern was raised with in the warranty period its the worst furniture quality my ikea sofa costed is much better never going to buy any furniture fromdfs
cant get through why i book with themif there no connection when ringingits quite straight forward in what imsaying is thst you cant get tbrought to your cancelling team you only want customers to ring the expensive number its not a good service its
i am so satisfied with dfds especially the staff at pearl sweet nice and helpful travels often with them and gladly
what can i say a big big thank you for your involvement in finding me a solution following the stupid decisions of our government mr julien you are our santa claus thanks to you we will spend a christmas with family thanks
i won a trip to oslo for people in a cinema game then came corona and very well the deadline was extended by almost years we now have to use it and it doesnt work i have tried in vain to get in touch with dfds via email for almost a month once they have answered and give an answer i cant use for anything and then communication stops simply such bad customer service
dear dfds i have now tried to get in touch with you by phone but it is completely hopeless i doubt if there is anyone to take calls at all also i have tried to write an email but no response that means extremely bad service i have booked a trip from kbh to oslo including breakfast but immediately afterwards i regret breakfast which is approved but money has still been deducted from my account for breakfast i want the amount returned for breakfast when breakfast has been cancelled but it is completely impossible to get in touch with you
very very disappointing both with getting in touch with dfds which is next to impossible i have both called and emailed of the money is withdrawn with them crawling in hiding when something needs to be changed i have been trying to contact them for a month
i sit as much as i can in a waiting position on the phone for now days about between and min waiting time i have a job and this is unbelievably bad service are there other numbers you can call i need to get in touch with youyou want money but do not treat customers well i have booked a trip and paid please contact me addition finally they answered the phone just now minand were incredibly friendly thank you maria
hi it simply cant be right that you cant get in touch with you to change your booking i just need to add a person to one of our cabins and change the reg no on car on my booking it says that it cannot be changed online but that you have to call on the phone it is just completely impossible i have been trying for a month vhbent
i have never before experienced such legendary bad customer service from such a large company they are impossible to get in touch with per phone and does not respond to inquiries by email
absolutely no customer service on phone and email no response so small from a big company
have now been trying to contact dfds for days havent been able to get through on the phone the chat is closed apparently and email sent days ago not answered
really hope we get stena line back to frederikshavn thought we could use you but without answers to simply a few questions i cant take dfds seriously
have you been trying to get through to your telephone support for a month so that i can use my gift card but when you only have phone time during working hours and you have to wait for hours it is impossible to get in touch now i have tried via email but here you also choose to be silent now my gift card has expired and i have lost dkk thanks for the poor support
i have been trying to communicate with you by email for so long response times are three weeks each time the answers i get are bland and as if you have to be held you request information i have already provided and then have to wait three weeks again for the next answer the inquiry was about gift card expiration so it seems questionable
now pick up your phone we have been calling for over hours without getting through the quotqueuequot
it is september completely impossible to get in touch with the kbh office by phone they just keep you waiting the dfds website says that the terminal office is open until pm but on the door it says opening hours are only until pm so i went there too in vain wonder if they even want customers
unfortunately it is completely impossible to get in touch with dfds they dont answer their phone and they dont answer emails either but it is of course a good way to guard against cancellations but its probably gone downhill for them have been happy with them in the past
they do not inform you about covid rules and charge you way too much for tests the customer service did not provide us with any solutions and were very rude
unable to order on the website due to technical error an order cannot be completed on the website which freezes when logging in its not professional
there is no one to answer in customer service when you cancel there is however a good time to send out advertisements and newsletters
this is the most rotten company ive seen with my children caught me in the riot and they dont let me in i had all the documents tests all sorts of things i had three hours to keep me there and a star does not deserve such are stupid that i just have no words for these people french i say something im talking there some documents they want all kinds of documents i give them and still continues such are the nazis
how can you run a business like this min plus plus of waiting for a stupid call beside they dont answer emails you guys deserve to leave space to someone else more schooled never ever book with dfds again
just have to say that you must have the worst customer service in norway impossible to get through on the phone you guys dont even answer emails dont understand how you can manage and still have customers
worst customer service ever and very bad experience very unhygienic and extarude staff i will never book with them again please avoid
on july i was promised by email that i could expect a refund within days it is now august and i still have not received anything although my emails were often responded to on the same day i have now sent emails to which no response has been received i can understand if something goes differently than planned but i must be informed about this now i get the feeling of being ignored
have given up on getting in touch with customer service because if you get through at all the call is disconnected after a few minutes i have been waiting for a reply to my email ref for days and doubt if ill ever get an answer
have now tried for days to get in touch with customer service without success incredibly bad service someone who can tell me how to succeed tage forsom
queued on the phone for the first minutes and then gave up after some time i called again and sat in a queue for hour and minutes and then finally gave up from a company that makes a living selling crossings so its a pain in the ass when you cant get in touch by phoneand yes i tried to find the answers i need on the website and no i didnt find them there so i had didnt call

very bad unfortunately since covid not worth travelling must pcr covid test at least for otherwise they will send you back home and you wont get any money back at all shame on you all of you humanity is dying too
extra slow client support costed me an expensive booking trash service
misunderstanding on my part for covid test but dfds at newhaven could not have done more to help me out first class service im a fairly regular customer but this is what you call customer care well done
had to use their service twice now due to a covid related trip absolute critical service delivered very well well done
puts annoying ads on spotify
the requirement to wear a mask and the minimum distance of m were not observed disinfectants are not sufficiently available the hygiene measures in the toilet are very disgusting clogged toilets no soap or towels
extremely satisfied highly recommended
everything was great very good service as always
overnight stay on board frederikshavngt oslo is ok but unfortunately there is no good wifi easy check in check out
good safety measures due to covid
explanation on board in different languages but unfortunately no dutch
very nice traveling with dfds
my crossings of the channel were uncomplicated timely comfortable and with friendly service thank you
dfds staff are very polite and helpful and you think of travel with them just to see thier friendly faces i recommend it to other to try it
good journey
very satisfied with the service i drive to the uk every month
the entire service was excellent we are very satisfied and happy that everything worked out so wonderfully
the price was too high otherwise everything was good
excellent hassle free experience always the best value for money for our channel crossings
yes i was allowed to write the name of viktor there the day before i had to make a day round trip from kbh december on tuesday where the day before the best representative of dfds viktor i spoke with after first getting the lowest service hopefully recorded from a norwegianspeaking gentleman a who gave me the lowest derogatory way of my life to address constantly interrupting when i wanted to answer his questions which either with me actually asked ombrefunding and was finished as a customer whereupon he again very derogatory towards a disabled person would give me as he constantly talked about quotthe system sucksquot and that where i emphasized partly that i travel as often as i can as i otherwise lie in a hospital bed at home but for a paid price of almost dkk he would give me where i interceded for him if he didnt have service and heart both up to christmas and an invalid where i could get almost dkk shame on you so when i called again this time i reached out with the gold in dvds viktor who was smiling through his voice understanding and even offered a disabled cabin with tv for the same price and luckily luge said departure was pm and not pm pm which i was used to we also agreed i got help with my things and was politely recommended to come around m so i happily said i would write a top class on this page about his exceptional service alas everything went horrible when in the terminal the elevator didnt work so i stood alone shouting for help as the alternative was a staircase impossible when you can only use one arm and an escalator i again stood and shouted but there wasnt a soul so i had to trying the escalator ended up falling halfway down backwards while its still going up and i screamed read got injuries all over and have screws and titanium in my shoulder and back and wasnt it for a customer showing up jumping over and held me experience the stairs did not get a finger or clothes and thus me pulled under the stairs so from here unforgettable action that may have teared my life however we sailed despite the injuries so at first the injuries were quotonlyquot that i looked like someone who had fought a tiger but unfortunately i got worse and the quotpmbriaquot was spoken to by a doctor so cf was hospitalized in hjrring which should have been frederikshavn and no one knew anything as i was told if you were ready to receive me in hjrring night i was put on even minor medical duty and before i left the ferry and big plus to all the staff i was told a report was made and they seated people in customer service of course he didnt count wanted to refuse to refund my money and i have called from the hospital and since returning home but spoke to a rude girl even though i asked to speak to a manager or viktor i get pickled and am ignored and people i ask for are there is never a promise you call back and as i said the staff said that without a doubt the fault was with dfds as the elevator should work and i am now approaching christmas i have almost no money as on the trip i was looking forward to skulking be a joy but a big company as dfds lets a cheeky pretentious school girl almost pick me up and speak harshly to me and my money happens and i hear nothing so the press is allowed in and possibly my lawyer and all in all the positive viktor took care of do you now destroy an invalid by pickling shortly before christmas for dkk plus all the pain and consequences i have scandalous and too low dfds

top always a great service every time i used thanks dfds

so im paying on an line which will be paying stena money waiting to speak to stena because their website doesnt work i have to listen to a constant stream of adverts for stena why would stena bother answering the phone im a captive to their advertising and paying them no wonder the wait time was minutes
hello emails are not answered within hours as advertised no response to date what a pity
never again stenline the new homepage does not mention that you cannot cancel for free click and is gone the customer hotline and support could not or would not reverse the cancellation
between harwich and hvholland our mobility phones were accidentally connected to their maritime radio system at am as a result we had to pay high costs to our internet supplier ziggovodaphone objecting to both companies resulted in a wall of unwillingness please note turn off your mobile phone or tablet completely on board stena lines warnings are minimal and practically impossible to find
i was trying to contact customer services couldnt find link had a lovely lady talk me through how to send email sent email and within hours a satisfactory reply very happy customer
gemma in the claims unit while she ccs the ceo stop sending me threatening emails about legal recourse against me you threatened to put down my dog after falsely accusing her of biting someone nobody received any hospital treatment because there was no bite so stop it grow up and apologise you are humiliating yourself and stena i have the police reports it never happened
full marks to megan the assistant in the office for helping me deal with a problem i had created myself with a booking error they were both efficient friendly had me sorted out in minutes thank you
we filed a complaint on august our questions have not been answered how difficult can it be to investigate a complaint we contacted several times and the result was that we received a case number and that was it we are still waitingcas lxk
dirty and in need of a complete overhaul but for the low price thats something you have to put up with
they have an operational problem min delay what a joke never ever again return daylight robbery and they cant even maintain the piece of junk
hour delay on sunday and looking at their ratings the company doesnt really care sent an email via their website crm looks like i wont get a reply wouldnt use them again shocking customer service i have a contract job and if i dont work i dont get paid but what do they care the no reply certainly shows how much they care
i have submitted a question and complaint to stenaline you will receive a case number and thats it i have resubmitted my complaint several times unfortunately there is no response at all the worst part is that you are simply ignored in a word scandalous ultimately you have no other option than to call in a lawyer to enforce a solution
great customer service really helped me out with a discount fare query which i was very happy about
horrible gate staff really rude will be calling stena line tomorrow to complain
abysmal service sending passengers to their cars then making them wait minutes or more to get off last time ill use them because its the same every time
i understand that stena are considering renaming the stena nordica the stena olympic flameit never goes out
the service personnel are racists they see having black hair they mistreat you and lie to you
hey stena waiting time on the telephone hotline hours seriously it can be better
my issue was resolved quickly and professionally thank you janette
super helpful flexible and overall nice staff
johncalvin made my experience incredible with his pink chicken
very poor service i never experienced
not dog friendly its a shame we have to go back with this company
i am full of praise for the staff at the hollandica especially jos from the service desk due to unforeseen circumstances i was no longer able to walk jos ensured that the trip to the netherlands was pleasant for me this good man really deserves a salary increase
delayed minutes going and now delayed minutes on return avoid stena line a digusting company
very difficult website for a large company
you seriously need to check your pricing one week stay return belfast to cairnryan i got p and o for catch yourselves on
friendly service very good information before checkin good breakfast everything was great would happily come again
rip off and not trusted company they charge you a lot when youre in need modern thieves
dave team leader at holyhead who has no surname apparently dave had total attitude from the moment he opened his mouth rude unhelpful and couldnt wait to get me off the phone truly awful customer serviceshow did this man get into this position
unhelpful staff on phone dont have a clue trying to book with tesco points can only be done online but online kicks u off so u ring up to be told it must be online weeks later and more expensive still unable to do it ring up to be told oh yes they will do it over phone of course they will as its now over dearer and its tuff if it wasn cheaper weeks ago wen i was trying to book it have to wait till monday now as i want a nanager to explain this to me y i have to pay more now thro no fault of my own
we just received amazing customer service from tom at stena he pickup phone after we stuck on online booking and helped out this is best i speak to cs in long time so professional
people in reception useless and very rude the wifi is so expensive and its not even working
i sent stena line a complaint about this but they never got back to me i received very poor communication from them at the holyhead port in november the manager and staff were so horrible i never received any reply when i sent my complaint or an apology
have been enjoying traveling with stena line for years now there is a problem with my account called customer service but this was really worthless the customer service representative was rude kept talking over me and kept blaming me as a customer worthlessly arranged because i slowly realized that i was not getting any further with this employee i hung up and called again in the hope of getting another employee this worked however the story here was pretty much the same she may not have been rude but she couldnt listen either and kept blaming me as a customer after this i hung up again and called again then i finally got a lady on the phone who was able to help me to my satisfaction its not that difficult to listen to so my tip for stena line fire inez from the bookings department and hire more ladies like the rd one i got on the phone unfortunately i just didnt remember her name
what an absolute disgrace your phone line should be made illegal hanging on the phone in a queue for over an hour cost in call charges and we were still unable to get through thats just the tip of the iceberg you should hang your heads in shame
website they have a very complicated website
turn off your phones while at sea or at least your data roaming as you may get charged obscene roaming charges even if you dont use your phone its one big scam and i was lucky to only of had to pay as i had a cap in place
got a refund done quickly
we would like to thank you for the friendly and understanding conversation with customer service even if unfortunately they were unable to help us thank you for the information
it cant be right that youre stuck on hold for about minutes then i hung up service looks different and then theres a number
incredibly unfriendly customer service when asked politely they received an impertinent response instead of a friendly response
yesterday morning going to hoek van holland there was a long queue with just one booth open and all the extra paperwork it took several minutes per car and many cars were send back it appeared that the quick covid test has to be approved by a certified clinician not what it said on the recommended test kit why can they tell you this when checking in and is there no information about this on stenas website and why doesnt stena lines have an agreement with a pcr testing company as so many other travel companies have it looks that stena lines are simply not interested in making it easy for their clients
the company does not deserve a star such uncooperative
xmas eve check in staff absolutely fantastic lady checking the car in full of good cheer made us smile as did the gentleman checking the car absolute credit to the company
i telephoned stena line this morning on regarding my son ryan palmers booking no despite the current state of affairs due to further outbreak of corona virus in london i was only waiting a very short time for my call to be answered the call was answered by an agent named anna she was cheerful on answering and wad very relaxed and did not hurry me in anyway i know they are extremely busy with christmas activity and now this outbreak again i became upset following her kind words and her unselfish manner to listen to me she is full of humanity and nature i havent come across a customer service agent like her in a very long time she cheered up my day everything will get sorted in the end she is a jewel in your crown i know you will appreciate all she does on behalf of stena line she without being asked offered me her name should i need further assistance a truly lovely girl with a big heart and an ability to understand situations people find themselves in which are outside of their control thank you pam
fantastic service all round good directional signage to ports easy to load onoff punctual journeys friendly and efficient staff well done
i booked a ticket on a thursday evening but discovered by mistake that i had booked gtbfrhavn instead of frhavngtb on friday morning i called in to correct the error but was told i have to pay a rebooking fee of sek hours after booking have to pay a fee for a wrong booking i can understand if i want to change my booking a month later but then shortly after due to a wrong booking and then you have to be punished with a change fee its simply bad customer service if this is the standard service you provide then you should be extremely grateful that you have no competition on the crossing
very helpful staff on phoneline full refund offered when quarantine measures meant we were unable to travel thanks for being such a great company well be rebooking as soon as we can
give yourselves a pat on the back for overcharging on amendments and applying a cancellation fee during these times you really should be very proud of yourselves
when i made the original booking in february and due to circumstances we have had to cancel our holiday arrangements following a phone call today because i paid for the premium service we could cancel with no penalty and the chap i spoke to was extremely helpful the confirmation of the cancellation came through on line within minutes and repayment to my card will take place in approximately days it was explained the due to the virus it may take a little long to me no problem with that it is nice to be told what is happening in advance we will have no problem in booking again when the circumstances are different im sorry i didnt get the chaps name but he polite and listened to my requirements thank you
